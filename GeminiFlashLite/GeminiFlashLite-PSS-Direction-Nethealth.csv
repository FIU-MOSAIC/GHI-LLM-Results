The participant exhibits a notable reduction in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a significant decrease in the CES-D score. This change is substantial, moving from a score suggesting a depressed state to one indicative of no depression, accompanied by a large negative Z-score of the delta. Simultaneously, the participant's self-reported anxiety, measured by the STAI, has also decreased, although to a lesser extent, with a modest reduction in score and a near-zero Z-score of the delta. Self-esteem has also seen a decline, with a reduction in score and a moderate negative Z-score of the delta, suggesting a slight decrease in perceived self-worth. Interpersonal trust has decreased, with a small reduction in score and a moderate negative Z-score of the delta. Happiness levels have remained stable.

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral patterns, the participant has experienced a significant increase in sleep latency, taking considerably longer to fall asleep, evidenced by a large positive delta in minutes and a substantial positive Z-score of the delta. While the desired sleep duration has decreased by one hour, the actual reported normal weekday sleep duration has remained unchanged. The feeling of control over sleep duration has also remained stable. In terms of substance usage, there has been an increase in wine or liquor consumption from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" reflected by a positive delta in usage. Other substance usage categories have remained stable.

Exercise habits have shifted towards reduced physical activity. The frequency of exercising alone has decreased significantly, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all,"" with a notable negative delta and a substantial negative Z-score of the delta. Exercise with others and sports participation frequency have remained unchanged. Daily recreational habits show a mixed pattern. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies has decreased, while time spent playing video games has substantially increased, marked by a large positive delta and a significant positive Z-score of the delta. Internet usage and listening to music have both increased, with notable positive deltas and Z-scores of the delta. Socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobby time have remained stable.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm regularity has decreased, indicated by a significant drop in Interdaily Stability, a negative delta, and a substantial negative Z-score of the delta. Conversely, Intradaily Variability has decreased, suggesting a reduction in fluctuations within the day, accompanied by a negative delta and a negative Z-score of the delta. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has also decreased, implying a less consistent daily rhythm, with a negative delta and Z-score of the delta. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, has slightly increased with a positive delta and a moderate positive Z-score of the delta. The Amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation, has decreased, indicated by a negative delta and a negative Z-score of the delta. The Acrophase has shifted later in the day. Resting heart rate has increased by 1.5 beats per minute, with a positive delta and a moderate positive Z-score of the delta. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals higher average heart rates during the evening and night hours in the current period compared to the previous period, particularly between 8 PM and 11 PM.

Sleep duration has decreased by 54 minutes, with a significant negative delta and Z-score of the delta, indicating shorter sleep durations. The standard deviation of sleep duration has also decreased, suggesting more consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time has shifted significantly later by 1 hour and 33 minutes, with a positive delta and a considerable positive Z-score of the delta, suggesting a later bedtime. The standard deviation of sleep start time has also decreased, indicating more consistent sleep timing.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress includes a significant increase in sleep latency, indicating difficulties in initiating sleep. While depressive symptoms have substantially improved, and anxiety has slightly decreased, self-esteem has declined, and interpersonal trust has reduced, which are factors that can contribute to higher stress levels. The decrease in physical activity, particularly exercising alone, and the increase in sedentary leisure activities like video games and internet usage, are behavioral shifts that can be associated with increased stress. Physiologically, the decrease in overall circadian rhythm regularity (Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation) and the shift towards a later Acrophase, coupled with an increased Mesor and a notably later Median Sleep Start Time, suggest a disrupted sleep-wake cycle. The increased resting heart rate and higher average heart rates during evening and nighttime hours further indicate a state of heightened physiological arousal. The reduction in sleep duration, despite the desire for more sleep, can also contribute to stress. The negative correlation between changes in Self-Esteem and changes in PSS score (-0.06) and the negative correlation between changes in Median Sleep Start Time and changes in PSS score (-0.19) provide some indirect support for a potential stress increase, as decreases in these areas might be linked to PSS increases.

Conversely, evidence for the improvement or stability of the PSS score is primarily derived from the significant reduction in depressive symptoms, which is a strong indicator of improved psychological well-being and potentially reduced stress. The decrease in Intradaily Variability of heart rate, if interpreted as a move towards a more stable daily rhythm, could be seen as positive.

Holistically, the combined evidence points towards a worsening of perceived stress. While depressive symptoms have significantly improved, the marked increase in sleep latency, coupled with a later and less stable sleep schedule, reduced sleep duration, increased sedentary behaviors, decreased self-esteem, and reduced trust, alongside physiological indicators of increased arousal and disrupted circadian rhythm, suggest a heightened stress response. The negative correlations with self-esteem and sleep start time also lend support to this interpretation.

92552,1.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits significant shifts in several psychological and behavioral indicators between the two measurement periods, with implications for perceived stress. Notably, the participant’s scores on the CES-D and STAI scales have increased substantially, moving from a non-depressed to a depressed classification on the CES-D and indicating a heightened level of chronic anxiety on the STAI. The CES-D score has seen a large delta of 31.0 with a corresponding high Z-score of 3.56, suggesting a marked increase in depressive symptoms. Similarly, the STAI score has increased by 15.0 (Z-score delta of 2.17), indicating a notable rise in trait anxiety. In contrast, self-esteem has experienced a significant decline, with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score decreasing by 18.0 (Z-score delta of -3.31), moving from a score of 44.0 to 26.0, which is a substantial drop relative to the population. Health satisfaction has also markedly decreased, with a delta of -2.11 (Z-score delta of -2.0), suggesting a significant decline in perceived physical health.

Lifestyle behaviors also show considerable changes. There has been a substantial reduction in the frequency of alcohol consumption, with both beer and wine/liquor usage decreasing from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Not at all,"" representing a delta of -3.0 for both categories. Exercise habits have also shifted; participation in exercising alone has decreased from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta of -1.0), and exercising with others has similarly decreased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all"" (delta of -2.0). However, engagement in sports has increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (delta of 1.0). Internet usage has decreased, with the time spent falling from ""1-2 hours"" to ""16-30 minutes"" (delta of -2.0), and listening to music has also decreased from ""1-2 hours"" to ""16-30 minutes"" (delta of -2.0). Conversely, participation in sedentary hobbies has increased from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""1-2 hours"" (delta of 2.0). Sleep patterns show a notable increase in sleep latency, from 30.0 minutes to 100.0 minutes (delta of 70.0 minutes, Z-score delta of 4.03), indicating a significantly longer time taken to fall asleep. While normal weekday sleep duration has increased by one hour (delta of 1.0 hour), the feeling of control over sleep duration has decreased, moving from ""Somewhat Disagree"" to ""Disagree"" (delta of -1.0).

Physiologically, the participant’s resting heart rate has increased by 6.85 bpm (Z-score delta of 1.49), moving from an average of 49.0 bpm to 55.85 bpm. This increase is accompanied by a shift in the circadian rhythm metrics. The mesor, representing the central tendency of the heart rate rhythm, has increased by 8.92 bpm (Z-score delta of 2.18), indicating a higher average heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase has also shifted earlier, from 8:48 PM to 5:12 PM, suggesting a potential alteration in the timing of peak physiological activity. While intradaily variability in heart rate has decreased significantly (delta of -0.25, Z-score delta of -1.99), the interdaily stability has also decreased (delta of -0.08, Z-score delta of -0.55). The standard deviation for sleep start time has increased notably from 94 minutes to 172 minutes (Z-score delta of 1.59), indicating greater variability in when the participant goes to sleep. The median sleep duration has decreased by 1 hour and 22 minutes (delta of -1.37 hours, Z-score delta of -1.77), and the standard deviation of sleep duration has increased by 19 minutes (Z-score delta of 0.56).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is indicated by significant increases in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and chronic anxiety (STAI). The substantial rise in CES-D from ""Not depressed"" to ""Depressed"" classification, coupled with a significant increase in STAI scores, strongly suggests an elevation in psychological distress. Furthermore, the marked decrease in self-esteem and health satisfaction contributes to a picture of declining psychological well-being. The increase in resting heart rate and mesor, indicative of higher physiological arousal, alongside a shift in circadian rhythm timing, may also reflect a heightened stress response. The significant increase in sleep latency suggests difficulties initiating sleep, a common symptom associated with increased stress.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. While normal weekday sleep duration has increased, this is counterbalanced by increased sleep latency and decreased control over sleep duration. The reduction in alcohol consumption is a positive behavioral change, but its correlation with PSS change is minimal. The increase in sports engagement is also a positive indicator, but its correlation with PSS change is also minimal. The decreased internet and music listening time, and increased sedentary hobby time, do not provide clear indicators for stress levels.

Holistically, the significant deteriorations in key psychological indicators such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, and self-esteem, coupled with physiological changes like increased resting heart rate and disrupted sleep initiation, overwhelmingly point towards an increase in the participant's perceived stress. The negative correlations between changes in some factors like STAI, SelfEsteem, and Sleep Latency with PSS change, while not explicitly provided, are suggested by their consistent direction of change with the observed increase in PSS. The strong negative correlation of initial PSS with change (-0.56) suggests that individuals starting with lower PSS are more likely to experience an increase. Given the substantial increases in measures directly associated with distress, the participant's overall perceived stress has likely worsened.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
73158,-6.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological indicators show subtle shifts. While the CES-D score increased by 1.0, remaining within the ""Not depressed"" classification, the STAI-Trait score also increased by 1.0, maintaining a ""not anxious"" classification. These increases, though modest, suggest a slight uptick in both depressive and anxiety-prone symptomatology. Conversely, self-esteem showed a small decrease of 1.0, yet the participant's Z-score remained highly positive, indicating generally robust self-worth. Trust in others notably increased by 0.5, a positive shift in social perception. Happiness remained stable with no change in score. Regarding sleep, the perceived latency to fall asleep increased by 5 minutes, moving towards a more negative Z-score of delta, while perceived normal weekday sleep duration increased by 0.5 hours, suggesting an improvement in the subjective experience of sleep quantity. However, the feeling of control over sleep duration remained unchanged.

Behaviorally, the participant has increased their frequency of exercising alone by one instance per week, shifting from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" a notable positive change. Exercise with others and sports participation remained stable. Daily recreation habits indicate a decrease in time spent watching TV/videos/movies by one unit of time, but an increase in video game usage by one unit of time. Internet usage and listening to music remained stable. Notably, the participant has ceased engaging in sedentary hobbies. Substance usage across all categories remains at ""Not at all,"" with no reported changes.

Physiologically, derived from wearable data, the interdaily stability of the participant's heart rate rhythm has decreased, as indicated by a negative delta and a negative Z-score of delta. This suggests a reduction in the regularity of daily heart rate patterns. The intradaily variability, conversely, has slightly increased, indicating more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours also decreased, further supporting a less consistent daily rhythm. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, has decreased, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has slightly increased. Resting heart rate has marginally increased. Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals an overall pattern of increased heart rate during early morning hours (5-7 AM) and late evening (12 PM-2 PM) in the current period compared to the previous period. Conversely, heart rates during mid-morning (8-11 AM) and late afternoon (3-5 PM) appear somewhat lower in the current period. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, has shifted slightly later in the day. Sleep duration has increased by 36 minutes on average, which is a positive development, but the standard deviation of sleep duration has also increased significantly, indicating greater variability and less consistency in sleep. While the median sleep start time has shifted slightly earlier, the standard deviation of sleep start time has more than doubled, suggesting a substantial decrease in sleep schedule regularity.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant's initial PSS score was 19.0, which was below the population average (Z-score of -0.71). There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) between the initial PSS score and changes in PSS score over time, suggesting that those with lower initial stress levels tended to experience greater increases in stress.

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress includes the marginal increases in both CES-D and STAI scores, hinting at a slight rise in depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. The decrease in interdaily stability and autocorrelation of heart rate, coupled with an increase in intradaily variability, suggests a disruption in the regularity of physiological rhythms, which can be associated with increased stress. Furthermore, the significant increase in the standard deviation of sleep duration and sleep start time points to a considerable loss of sleep regularity, a common correlate of elevated stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress includes a significant increase in trust in others, a positive psychological indicator. The increase in normal weekday sleep duration, though accompanied by greater variability, represents a longer average sleep time. The participant also increased their frequency of exercising alone, a positive lifestyle change.

Holistically, while some positive lifestyle and psychological shifts are present (increased trust, increased exercise frequency, longer average sleep), the significant deterioration in sleep regularity (increased standard deviation in both duration and start time) and the decline in the regularity of physiological rhythms (decreased interdaily stability and autocorrelation) are strong indicators of increasing stress. The modest increases in CES-D and STAI scores, while small, align with this trend. The correlation between initial PSS and change suggests that participants starting with lower stress might experience an increase, which aligns with the observed pattern. Therefore, the cumulative evidence suggests a likely increase in perceived stress.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
22138,-5.0,"Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological and lifestyle data reveal several notable changes between the two data collection periods. A significant decrease in depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale (Delta: -10.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.97), is observed. Concurrently, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, also decreased (Delta: -9.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.91), and self-esteem showed a modest reduction (Delta: -4.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.72). Interpersonal trust, a key social indicator, experienced a substantial decrease (Delta: -0.5, Z-Score of Delta: -1.34). In terms of sleep habits, the time taken to fall asleep, or sleep latency, increased by 10 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.44), while the participant reported a shorter ideal weekday sleep duration (Delta: -0.5 hours, Z-Score of Delta: -0.32). Despite this, the actual reported normal weekday sleep duration increased by one hour (Delta: 1.0 hours, Z-Score of Delta: 0.92). Health satisfaction showed a notable increase (Delta: 0.89, Z-Score of Delta: 0.77).

Behavioral patterns also indicate shifts. Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor remained consistent. Non-prescribed drug use and recreational drug use were reported as ""Not at all"" in both periods, with no change. Exercise habits show a decrease in frequency of exercising with others (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.43), while exercising alone and engaging in sports remained unchanged. Significant changes are evident in daily recreational habits. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies decreased (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.82), while time spent playing video games dramatically increased (Delta Num: 5.0, Z-Score of Delta: 3.54). Conversely, internet usage decreased substantially (Delta Num: -3.0, Z-Score of Delta: -2.14). Time spent listening to music decreased, and time spent on sedentary hobbies also decreased slightly. Notably, time spent socializing with friends increased (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.75), and time spent reading increased (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.6).

Physiological data derived from wearable devices highlight some variations in circadian rhythm and heart rate. Interdaily stability of the circadian rhythm slightly decreased (Delta: -0.07, Z-Score of Delta: -0.48), while intraday variability remained stable (Delta: 0.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.22). Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (Delta: 0.08, Z-Score of Delta: 0.45), suggesting a potentially more consistent daily rhythm in that regard. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, increased (Delta: 2.5, Z-Score of Delta: 0.78), and the resting heart rate also increased by 1.9 bpm (Delta: 1.9, Z-Score of Delta: 0.44). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm decreased (Delta: -2.37, Z-Score of Delta: -0.81). Sleep statistics show a modest increase in median sleep duration (Delta: 14 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: 0.12), but a decrease in the standard deviation of sleep duration (Delta: -28 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: -0.57), indicating more consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time shifted later by 50 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.92), while the standard deviation of sleep start time decreased significantly (Delta: -55 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: -1.07), suggesting a more regular, albeit later, sleep schedule. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal elevated heart rates during specific evening hours (e.g., 6-7pm and 9-10pm) in the current period compared to the previous one.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, significant improvements are observed in psychological well-being indicators: a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with increased health satisfaction. Sleep duration consistency has also improved, with a reduced standard deviation in sleep duration, and the overall median sleep duration has slightly increased. Social engagement through ""Socializing with Friends"" and ""Reading"" have also increased. These factors generally suggest a reduction in stressors or improved coping mechanisms.

However, several data points suggest potential areas of stress or less adaptive behavioral shifts. The increase in sleep latency indicates difficulty initiating sleep, and the later median sleep start time, though more consistent, suggests a disruption in the typical sleep schedule. A notable increase in time spent on video games, alongside a significant decrease in internet usage, indicates a shift in leisure activities that could be indicative of escapism or an attempt to manage distress. The decrease in interpersonal trust is a concerning indicator that may reflect underlying stress or social challenges. Furthermore, the mesor and resting heart rate have increased, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has decreased, which can sometimes be associated with stress or maladjustment. The correlation of the initial PSS score with changes in PSS (-0.56) suggests that individuals with initially higher PSS scores tend to experience a decrease in PSS over time, while those with initially lower PSS scores may see an increase. Given the initial PSS score of 24.0, which is above the average (Z-Score: 0.65), this correlation might suggest a tendency towards improvement for this participant. The absence of a direct PSS score change measurement necessitates inference from related measures. Considering the strong positive indicators of reduced depressive symptoms, reduced anxiety, and increased health satisfaction, these are often direct correlates of reduced perceived stress. While some physiological and behavioral changes warrant attention, the positive shifts in core psychological well-being measures appear to be the most salient indicators of stress reduction.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
31439,-3.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several notable changes in their psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods, with some indications of shifts in stress-related indicators. In terms of self-reported mental health, a significant reduction in depressive symptoms is observed, as indicated by a decrease of 4.0 points on the CES-D scale, moving from a classification of 'Depressed' to 'Not depressed.' Concurrently, anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI-Trait, also decreased by 4.0 points, though the participant's classification remained 'anxious.' Self-esteem, assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, experienced a marked decline of 9.0 points, shifting from a relatively higher score to a lower one, suggesting a decrease in self-worth. Subjective feelings of control over sleep duration improved slightly, with a positive shift in response. Conversely, the participant reported a decrease in overall health satisfaction, with a reduction of 0.56 points. Regarding daily activities, there was a substantial decrease in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies, a reduction of 3.0 numerical categories, alongside a decrease in time spent reading, by 1.0 category. However, internet usage and time dedicated to sedentary hobbies showed an increase. Physical activity also underwent a transformation, with a significant decrease in exercising alone and with others, both by 2.0 frequency categories, while participation in sports increased by 1.0 frequency category.

Physiological and sleep metrics derived from wearable data present a more complex picture. The participant's median sleep duration increased by 23 minutes, a positive change, yet the standard deviation of sleep duration also increased, suggesting greater variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time shifted later by approximately 30 minutes, which, when considered with the earlier sleep start time and higher previous Z-score for sleep duration, may indicate a less consistent sleep schedule. The resting heart rate experienced a slight decrease of 0.5 beats per minute, remaining within a comparable Z-score range to the previous period, but its overall Z-score is high, indicating it is above the population average. The mesor, a measure of the central tendency of the circadian rhythm, slightly decreased, while the amplitude, reflecting the peak-to-trough variation, increased marginally. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm decreased, indicating less regularity in daily patterns, while intradaily variability increased, suggesting more fluctuation within a given day. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, shifted later by approximately 35 minutes, from 4:25 PM to 5:00 PM.

Correlations between changes in these metrics and changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores are provided as supplementary guidance. Notably, the initial PSS score of 23.0, which is above the population average (Z-score of 0.38), had a negative correlation (-0.56) with the change in PSS over time, suggesting that higher initial stress levels were associated with a decrease in stress. The CES-D score change had a positive correlation (0.26) with PSS change, indicating that a reduction in depressive symptoms was associated with an increase in PSS. Conversely, the change in self-esteem exhibited a negative correlation (-0.06) with PSS change, implying that a decrease in self-esteem might be associated with a decrease in PSS. Changes in sleep latency and internet usage also showed minor negative correlations with PSS change. The most significant negative correlation was observed for the change in STAI-Trait anxiety (-0.19) with PSS change, suggesting that a reduction in anxiety was associated with a decrease in PSS.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress includes a significant decline in self-esteem (-9.0 points) and a slight decrease in health satisfaction (-0.56 points). Furthermore, the CES-D score, despite classifying as 'Not depressed,' showed a decrease that positively correlated with PSS change, suggesting that improvements in depressive symptoms might coincide with increased stress. The increase in internet usage and sedentary hobbies, along with a decrease in social interactions and exercise with others, could also contribute to heightened stress. The observed decrease in interdaily stability and increase in intradaily variability of heart rate suggest a less regulated physiological rhythm, which can be indicative of stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is present in the significant reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D score decreased by 4.0 points and transitioned from 'Depressed' to 'Not depressed'). Anxiety levels (STAI-Trait) also decreased by 4.0 points, moving closer to the population average. The median sleep duration increased, and the resting heart rate showed a slight decrease. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS suggests that individuals with higher baseline stress may experience a reduction over time, which aligns with the participant's initial PSS being above average. The negative correlation between changes in STAI-Trait and PSS change also supports a potential decrease in stress.

Holistically analyzing the evidence, the reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with an increase in overall sleep duration and a slight decrease in resting heart rate, suggests a positive shift in psychological and physiological well-being. While the decline in self-esteem and changes in activity patterns are concerning, the strong indicators of reduced depressive symptomatology and anxiety, along with the guiding correlations, point towards an overall improvement or stability in perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported psychological state shows mixed changes. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, remained stable with no change in score and a minimal positive Z-score change, suggesting a consistent, moderate level of depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, showed a slight increase in score (2.0 points), moving towards a higher level of anxiety proneness, though still classified as ""not anxious."" Self-esteem, measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, experienced a decrease of 4.0 points, moving the participant's score to a lower level of self-worth compared to the previous assessment. While the participant reports a desire for 8 hours of sleep, their normal weekday sleep duration has remained at 7 hours, with no change in the feeling of control over sleep duration, which remains high.

Behavioral patterns indicate a notable shift in substance usage and social activities. The frequency of beer consumption has increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" representing a significant upward trend in alcohol intake. Conversely, the usage of wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs has remained consistently ""Not at all."" In terms of exercise, there has been a positive trend. Exercising alone has increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" and exercising with others has also increased from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month."" Participation in sports has also seen a substantial increase, moving from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month."" Regarding daily recreation, there has been a reduction in time spent playing video games, decreasing from ""2-3 hours"" to ""1-2 hours."" Conversely, time spent listening to music has increased significantly, from ""1-2 hours"" to ""3-4 hours."" Socializing with friends has decreased slightly in duration, from ""2-3 hours"" to ""1-2 hours."" Reading habits have also shifted, with the participant now engaging in reading for ""15 minutes or less"" compared to previously ""Do not do,"" suggesting a new, albeit limited, engagement with reading.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a decrease in their resting heart rate from 61.6 bpm to 58.9 bpm, which is a clinically favorable change. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general pattern of elevated heart rates during waking hours, particularly in the late afternoon and evening (peak around 8-9 PM). While the Mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours) has slightly decreased, it remains largely stable. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has slightly increased, suggesting a larger variation between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, has shifted later in the day, from 5:09 PM to 6:09 PM. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a slight decrease in Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggesting a minor reduction in the regularity of the daily heart rate pattern. Intradaily Variability has remained largely stable. Sleep duration has decreased slightly by 8 minutes, and the median sleep start time has become later by 31 minutes, with a notable increase in the variability of sleep start times.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Analysis of the provided data suggests a potential increase in the participant's overall perceived stress. While some metrics indicate positive changes, such as a decrease in resting heart rate and increased engagement in exercise and listening to music, other indicators point towards increased stress. The decrease in self-esteem, coupled with a slight increase in trait anxiety, suggests a worsening psychological outlook. The increase in beer consumption represents a significant lifestyle change that could be indicative of increased coping-related stress behaviors. Furthermore, the slight decrease in sleep duration and later, more variable sleep start times, despite no change in self-reported sleep latency or control, could contribute to elevated stress levels.

While the decrease in resting heart rate is a positive physiological sign, the overall pattern of increased substance use (beer), decreased self-esteem, and slightly increased anxiety, alongside subtle negative shifts in sleep regularity, collectively suggest a potential increase in perceived stress. The correlations provided, particularly the negative correlation between the initial PSS score and its change (-0.56), indicate that individuals with lower initial PSS scores tend to experience greater increases in PSS over time. Given the participant's initial PSS score was not particularly high (Z-score of 0.1), this correlation suggests a propensity for stress to increase.

Considering the combined evidence, particularly the psychosocial indicators and behavioral shifts towards potentially maladaptive coping, the participant's overall perceived stress appears to have worsened.

The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was notably low (13.0, Z-score of -2.34), suggesting a baseline of relatively low perceived stress. Analysis of subsequent data reveals several shifts in psychological and behavioral markers that may be relevant to changes in stress levels. In terms of psychological self-report, a modest increase in depressive symptoms was observed, as indicated by a 3.0-point rise in the CES-D score (Z-score of change: 0.47), moving from a ""Not depressed"" classification to a slightly higher score within that same classification. Conversely, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, showed a slight decrease of 2.0 points, remaining within the ""anxious"" classification. Self-esteem and general trust levels remained stable, with zero change recorded on both measures. There was a notable improvement in health satisfaction, with a 1.56-point increase (Z-score of change: 1.39), moving from a below-average satisfaction level to a score slightly above the population mean.

In the domain of sleep, while self-reported sleep latency and feeling of control over sleep duration remained unchanged, there was a decrease in the desired weekday sleep time by one hour (Z-score of change: -0.7). The actual reported normal weekday sleep duration remained stable. Fitbit data indicated a slight increase in median sleep duration by 3 minutes, with a negligible change in its Z-score. The standard deviation of sleep duration decreased slightly, suggesting a marginal improvement in sleep consistency. A more pronounced change was observed in the median sleep start time, which shifted earlier by 28 minutes (Z-score of change: -0.57), indicating a potential regularization of the sleep schedule. However, the standard deviation of sleep start time also decreased, which, when considered with the earlier start time, might suggest a more consolidated, albeit not necessarily improved, sleep pattern.

Behavioral data indicate some shifts in activity patterns. Alcohol consumption (wine or liquor) increased by one unit, moving from ""less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month."" Exercise habits showed a decrease in solitary exercise frequency, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""less than 1-2 times a month,"" while exercise with others remained stable. Participation in sports increased from ""not at all"" to ""less than 1-2 times a month."" Daily recreational habits showed no change in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or internet usage, which remained consistently high (over 4 hours). There was a slight increase in time spent listening to music, and a decrease in sedentary hobby engagement.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicate significant changes. The mesor, a measure of the mean daily heart rate, increased by 4.91 bpm (Z-score of change: 1.3), moving from being slightly above average to a more elevated level. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm also increased by 1.33, suggesting a wider fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The resting heart rate also increased by 2.1 bpm. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general pattern of elevated heart rates during the daytime and early evening hours in the current period compared to the previous one. Specifically, peak heart rates during the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 12 PM - 8 PM) show an increase in average hourly heart rates by approximately 5-10 bpm. This is particularly evident in the 12-1 PM (increase of 7.15 bpm), 1-2 PM (increase of 4.54 bpm), 2-3 PM (increase of 8.22 bpm), and 5-6 PM (increase of 9.49 bpm) intervals. Conversely, overnight heart rates (e.g., 12 AM - 6 AM) show a slight decrease or remained relatively stable. Circadian rhythm metrics revealed a decrease in intradaily variability (Z-score of change: -0.79), suggesting a more stable daily pattern of heart rate, despite the increased mesor and amplitude. Interdaily stability remained unchanged. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, shifted slightly later by 23 minutes.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress includes the rise in the mesor and amplitude of the heart rate, suggesting increased physiological arousal. The elevated hourly heart rates observed during waking hours, particularly in the afternoon and early evening, alongside an increase in resting heart rate, are indicative of heightened physiological stress responses. The increase in CES-D scores, while remaining within the ""not depressed"" range, suggests a slight uptick in depressive symptoms, which can be associated with increased stress. Furthermore, the decrease in desired sleep time, although not directly impacting reported duration, could reflect a feeling of not having enough time, a common stressor. The correlation of the initial PSS score with changes in PSS is -0.56, indicating that individuals with lower initial PSS scores tend to experience increases in PSS over time, aligning with the participant's low baseline.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. Self-esteem and trust levels remained stable. Trait anxiety decreased slightly. Health satisfaction significantly improved, and participation in sports increased. While sleep start time became more regular, the overall changes in sleep duration and variability were minimal. The decrease in intradaily variability of heart rate suggests a more consistent daily rhythm, which could be a mitigating factor against stress. The correlation of the initial PSS score with changes in PSS also suggests that those starting with low stress are more prone to increase their stress, which aligns with the observed changes.

Considering the multimodal data, the observed increases in physiological markers of arousal (mesor, amplitude, resting heart rate, and elevated hourly heart rates during the day) coupled with a slight increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D) provide substantial evidence for an increase in perceived stress. While some positive changes are noted (health satisfaction, sports participation), they appear to be outweighed by the physiological indicators of heightened stress. The participant's initial low PSS score and its negative correlation with PSS change further support the observation of an increase in stress over time.

84011,0.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates notable shifts across several self-reported and wearable-derived metrics between the two data collection periods. In terms of psychological well-being, a decrease in depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D scale, is observed, moving from a score of 6.0 to 4.0 (Z-score delta of -0.09). Concurrently, trait anxiety (STAI) has slightly decreased from 44.0 to 41.0 (Z-score delta of -0.14). Self-esteem has seen a marginal increase, from 33.0 to 35.0 (Z-score delta of 0.39), and health satisfaction has also improved, from 5.0 to 5.33 (Z-score delta of 0.26). A significant decrease in self-reported happiness is noted, moving from a score of 4.0 to 3.0 (Z-score delta of -0.96). The participant's trust in others has increased from 2.83 to 3.17 (Z-score delta of 0.72).

Sleep habits show a mixed pattern. Subjective sleep latency has decreased from 15.0 minutes to 10.0 minutes (Z-score delta of -0.46), and the perceived control over sleep duration has improved from 'Disagree' to 'Somewhat Agree' (change Z-score of 1.58). However, the median sleep duration has decreased by 22 minutes, moving from 8 hours 28 minutes to 8 hours 6 minutes (Z-score delta of -0.59). The median sleep start time has shifted slightly later by 4 minutes (Z-score delta of 0.06). Wearable-derived sleep duration standard deviation has marginally decreased, indicating slightly more consistent sleep durations.

Regarding substance usage, the participant's reported weekly consumption of beer has increased from 'Not at all' to '1-2 times a week' (delta Z-score of 2.62), and wine or liquor usage has also increased from '1-2 times a month' to '1-2 times a week' (delta Z-score of 0.73). Exercise habits show an increase in exercising alone from '1-2 times a month' to '1-2 times a week' (delta Z-score of 0.91), while frequencies for exercising with others and sports participation have remained stable at 'Three times a week or more'. Daily recreation habits indicate a decrease in listening to music from 'Do not do' to '15 minutes or less' (delta Z-score of 0.52).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 5.4 bpm (Z-score delta of -1.1), suggesting a potential improvement in cardiovascular health or reduced baseline arousal. The Mesor, a measure of central tendency in heart rate, has also decreased significantly by -6.17 (Z-score delta of -1.11), which, in conjunction with the lower resting heart rate, may indicate a reduction in overall physiological load. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier by approximately one hour, from 4:43 PM to 3:34 PM. Interdaily stability of heart rate has slightly decreased, and intradaily variability has also decreased, which might suggest a less varied daily heart rate pattern. The correlation of the delta PSS with the changes in these metrics is largely weak, with only the STAI and CES-D showing moderate positive correlations, and Self-Esteem showing a weak negative correlation.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a potential increase in perceived stress is suggested by a notable decrease in self-reported happiness (delta Z-score of -0.96). Conversely, several indicators point towards an improvement or stability in perceived stress. The decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D delta Z-score of -0.09), a slight reduction in trait anxiety (STAI delta Z-score of -0.14), and an increase in self-esteem (delta Z-score of 0.39) are all indicative of a reduction in psychological distress. Improvements in health satisfaction (delta Z-score of 0.26) and trust (delta Z-score of 0.72) also contribute to this perspective. Physiologically, the reduction in resting heart rate (delta Z-score of -1.1) and Mesor (delta Z-score of -1.11) suggest a decrease in physiological arousal. While sleep duration has decreased, subjective sleep latency and perceived control over sleep have improved. The increased consumption of alcohol (beer and wine/liquor) might be a coping mechanism for stress, but the overall picture from psychological and physiological markers leans towards reduced stress. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that individuals with higher initial PSS scores tend to experience a decrease in PSS, and this participant's initial PSS score was below the population mean.

Considering the confluence of reduced depressive symptoms, lower anxiety, increased self-esteem, improved health satisfaction, and a lower resting heart rate and Mesor, the evidence suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress has likely decreased or remained stable. The decrease in happiness, while noted, appears to be overshadowed by the more robust indicators of reduced distress.

88008,0.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits notable shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics across the two data collection periods. A significant concern arises from the reported increase in depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D score, which rose from 20.0 to 27.0, a change that is 0.91 standard deviations above the mean change. This is accompanied by a substantial increase in trait anxiety (STAI), moving from 48.0 to 56.0, representing a delta Z-score of 1.27. Concurrently, self-esteem has declined, with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score decreasing from 33.0 to 27.0, a change of -1.09 standard deviations. Health satisfaction has also worsened, with the score dropping from 3.33 to 2.22 (delta Z-score of -1.08), and interpersonal trust has decreased from 2.83 to 2.5 (delta Z-score of -0.93). These psychological indicators suggest a period of increased emotional distress and reduced well-being.

Behaviorally, there have been changes in substance usage and recreational habits. The participant has increased their consumption of beer and wine/liquor from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" with significant positive Z-scores for these changes (1.66 and 1.72, respectively). While exercise frequency in sports has decreased (delta of -1.0 units), engagement in other recreational activities has increased. Specifically, time spent playing video games has increased by one unit (delta Z-score of 0.64), listening to music has increased by one unit (delta Z-score of 0.52), socializing with friends has increased by one unit (delta Z-score of 0.75), and reading has increased by one unit (delta Z-score of 0.60). Notably, sedentary hobby time has also increased significantly by three units (delta Z-score of 1.41).

Physiologically, measured by wearable data, there are indications of a slightly more disrupted circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability of heart rate has marginally decreased (-0.02), although this change is not statistically significant in terms of its Z-score (-0.11). However, intradaily variability of heart rate has increased (0.12, Z-score of 0.63), suggesting greater fluctuations within the day. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm has shifted earlier, from 5:35 PM to 4:20 PM, indicating a potential earlier peak in physiological activity. While the MESOR has slightly decreased, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has also reduced, suggesting a less pronounced daily swing. Resting heart rate has increased slightly by 1.3 beats per minute. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general decrease in heart rate across most hours compared to the previous period, with a notable reduction in the early morning and late evening hours. However, the peak heart rates during midday and early afternoon appear to be slightly higher or sustained.

Sleep patterns show a modest improvement in median sleep duration, increasing by 18 minutes, which is a positive change, although its correlation with PSS change is very low (0.02). The standard deviation for sleep duration has slightly increased, indicating less consistency. The median sleep start time has shifted 12 minutes earlier, which could be perceived as a positive adjustment towards earlier sleep, but its correlation with PSS change is negative (-0.18). The standard deviation for sleep start time has decreased, suggesting more regular sleep timing.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is robust and multifaceted. The significant increases in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with a notable decline in self-esteem and health satisfaction, strongly indicate elevated stress. The increases in alcohol and liquor consumption, alongside a substantial rise in sedentary leisure activities like video gaming and general internet usage, can be interpreted as coping mechanisms or indicators of reduced engagement in more beneficial activities, potentially reflecting increased stress. While there are some positive sleep duration changes and a slight shift towards earlier sleep, these are overshadowed by the adverse psychological and behavioral indicators. The physiological data, particularly the increase in intradaily heart rate variability and the shift in acrophase, also suggest a less regulated physiological state, which can be associated with stress. The overall pattern points towards a decline in well-being and an increase in perceived stress.

The participant exhibits a significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a substantial decrease in CES-D scores. The Z-score for this change is markedly negative (-3.41), signifying a substantial improvement compared to the study population. This improvement in depressive symptomatology is also accompanied by a notable reduction in trait anxiety, evidenced by a decrease in STAI scores with a Z-score of -2.33. Conversely, self-esteem has increased, with a positive Z-score of 2.06 for the change in the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, suggesting a positive shift in self-worth. Health satisfaction has marginally improved, with a positive but small Z-score of 0.15 for the change in health satisfaction scores. Interpersonal trust has shown a slight increase, indicated by a positive Z-score of 0.31 for the change in trust scores. Self-reported happiness has also increased, with a Z-score of 0.71 for the change in happiness scores, indicating a more positive subjective emotional state.

Regarding sleep habits, sleep latency, and the feeling of control over sleep duration have remained stable, with Z-scores of change close to zero. The participant's reported normal weekday sleep duration has slightly increased by 0.5 hours, reflected by a Z-score of 0.41 for the change. However, the ideal sleep duration has remained unchanged.

In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant has initiated the consumption of wine or liquor, transitioning from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" with a change Z-score of 0.73. Exercise habits have shifted, with a decrease in exercising alone (Z-score of change -1.65) and an increase in exercising with others (Z-score of change 1.71). There has been no change in sports participation or engagement in recreational drugs. Daily recreational activities show a notable decrease in listening to music, with a change Z-score of -0.54, and no change in watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, socializing with friends, reading, or sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 1.3 beats per minute, with a positive Z-score of 0.32 for this change. The mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, has decreased by 3.9, resulting in a Z-score of -0.62 for the change, indicating a lower average heart rate. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has also decreased by 1.6, with a Z-score of -0.55, suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, has shifted later by 18 minutes.

Circadian rhythm regularity metrics show a slight decrease in interdaily stability of heart rate (-0.06, Z-score -0.4) and a similar decrease in intradaily variability (-0.05, Z-score -0.58). Autocorrelation at 24 hours has increased by 0.11, with a Z-score of 0.65, suggesting a more consistent daily pattern in heart rate. Sleep duration has slightly decreased by 7 minutes, though the standard deviation of sleep duration has increased by 25 minutes. Sleep start time has become approximately 18 minutes later on average.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The data presents a mixed picture regarding potential changes in perceived stress. On one hand, significant improvements are observed in key psychological indicators strongly associated with stress, namely a marked decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and a substantial reduction in trait anxiety (STAI). The increase in self-esteem and happiness further suggests a more positive psychological state, which typically correlates with lower stress. The slight increase in health satisfaction also aligns with a reduction in stress.

However, several factors suggest potential increases in stress or a maintenance of stress levels. The introduction of wine or liquor consumption, even at a low frequency, could be an indicator of coping mechanisms for stress. The decrease in exercising alone and the increase in exercising with others might reflect a shift in social engagement that could be influenced by stress, though the positive correlation with exercising with others suggests it may be beneficial. The decrease in listening to music could represent a reduction in a self-soothing activity.

Physiologically, the increase in resting heart rate, despite a decrease in mesor and amplitude, might indicate underlying physiological arousal that could be linked to stress. The later acrophase and slight increase in sleep start time could suggest a disruption in the circadian rhythm, which is often associated with increased stress. The increase in the standard deviation of sleep duration and the decrease in median sleep duration, while small, could also be indicators of stress-related sleep disturbances. The decrease in interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate, alongside an increase in autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggests a more rigid but less dynamic circadian rhythm, which can be linked to prolonged stress.

Considering the strong improvements in depressive symptomatology and trait anxiety, which are direct indicators of psychological distress, it is plausible that the overall perceived stress has not significantly worsened. The initial PSS score was 24.0, with a positive Z-score of 0.65, indicating a moderately high initial stress level relative to the study population. The correlation of the initial PSS score with changes to said score over time is -0.56, suggesting that higher initial stress might be associated with a decrease in stress over time in this dataset. While there are physiological and behavioral shifts that could be indicative of stress, the pronounced improvements in mood and anxiety are more directly related to perceived stress.

Given the significant amelioration of depressive symptoms and anxiety, combined with an increase in self-esteem and happiness, the evidence leans towards an improvement or stabilization in perceived stress. The physiological changes, while notable, do not definitively point to a worsening of perceived stress in the absence of higher PSS scores.

**Psychological Well-being and Stressors:**

The participant has demonstrated a significant improvement in psychological well-being. Notably, scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) have decreased by 18.0 points (Z-score of delta: -1.86), moving from a classification of ""Depressed"" to ""Not depressed."" Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores have reduced by 17.0 points (Z-score of delta: -1.94), shifting the classification from ""anxious"" to ""not anxious."" These substantial improvements suggest a reduction in depressive and anxious symptomatology. Self-esteem has seen a modest increase of 2.0 points (Z-score of delta: 0.39), indicating a slight but positive shift in self-worth. However, trust levels have decreased by 0.67 points (Z-score of delta: -1.75), moving from -0.78 to -2.09 relative to the population Z-score. Happiness also saw a slight decrease of 1.0 point (Z-score of delta: -0.96). These shifts, particularly the decrease in trust, warrant further observation. The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) has increased by 2.43 units, moving from 23.12 to 25.56, placing them in the overweight category. Health satisfaction has also improved, increasing by 1.56 points (Z-score of delta: 1.39).

**Sleep Habits and Quality:**

There have been notable changes in sleep patterns. The median sleep duration has significantly increased by 2 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score of delta: 2.54), reaching 8 hours and 32 minutes, which is substantially above the population average. Conversely, the standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased by 30 minutes (Z-score of delta: -0.62), suggesting more consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 1 hour and 8 minutes (Z-score of delta: 1.26), now commencing at 01:38:30. This later start time, coupled with the increased duration, might indicate a shift in sleep schedule. The self-reported ""Feeling of being in control over sleep duration"" has also increased (Delta: 1.0, Change Z-Score: 0.39), moving from 'Agree' to 'Strongly Agree,' indicating a perceived increase in agency over sleep. However, sleep latency has dramatically increased by 90 minutes (Z-score of delta: 5.22), rising from 30 minutes to 120 minutes. This significant increase in time taken to fall asleep, despite the longer duration of sleep, could be a contributing factor to stress or a consequence of it. The desired weekday sleep time has remained stable at 8.0 hours.

**Behavioral Patterns and Physical Activity:**

Substance usage remains at ""Not at all"" across all categories, indicating no change in this domain. Regarding exercise, there has been an increase in the frequency of ""Exercised Alone,"" moving from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.91). Other exercise categories, ""Exercised with Others"" and ""Sports,"" have remained at ""Not at all."" Daily recreation habits show a decrease in ""Listening to Music"" (Delta Num: -2.0) and ""Sedentary Hobby"" (Delta Num: -3.0) time. Conversely, ""Socializing with Friends"" has increased significantly by an estimated 1-2 hours (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.18). Internet usage time has slightly increased by one unit (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.55).

**Physiological Metrics and Circadian Rhythm:**

The participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 4.2 bpm (Z-score of delta: -0.85), from 67.8 bpm to 63.6 bpm, which is within the population average. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a noticeable shift in the pattern of physiological arousal. While the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) has slightly decreased (Delta: -1.45, Z-Score of Delta: -0.08), the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased (Delta: 1.5, Z-Score of Delta: 0.5). The acrophase, representing the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, has shifted later by approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes, from 4:05 PM to 6:50 PM. This later peak, combined with a slightly higher average heart rate during the evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 9-11 PM shows higher average rates in current data compared to previous), suggests a potential delay or disruption in the typical diurnal pattern of physiological activity. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity, Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability, have remained unchanged. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has slightly increased.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The available data presents a complex picture regarding the participant's perceived stress. On one hand, there are strong indicators of improvement in psychological distress. The substantial reduction in CES-D and STAI scores, moving from ""Depressed"" and ""Anxious"" classifications to ""Not depressed"" and ""Not anxious"" respectively, strongly suggests a decrease in subjective stress and related symptoms. The increase in self-reported control over sleep also points towards improved coping mechanisms.

However, several factors suggest potential for stable or even worsening stress. The significant increase in sleep latency, despite longer overall sleep duration, is a notable concern and could indicate underlying stress or anxiety that interferes with sleep onset. The decrease in trust and happiness scores, although less pronounced than the improvements in depression and anxiety, are negative trends. Furthermore, the shift in the circadian rhythm acrophase to later in the day, coupled with slightly elevated average heart rates during evening and nighttime hours, might indicate physiological dysregulation that can be associated with increased stress. The increase in BMI is also a concern for overall health and well-being.

Considering the prominent improvements in key indicators of psychological distress (depression and anxiety), coupled with increased control over sleep, the evidence leans towards an overall improvement or stabilization in perceived stress. While the increased sleep latency and shifts in circadian rhythm warrant monitoring, they do not currently overshadow the significant positive changes in mood and anxiety. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that higher initial PSS was associated with a decrease in PSS, which aligns with the observed improvements.

45076,-9.0,"The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was notably high (29.0, Z=2.01), indicating a significant level of stress at baseline. Subsequent data reveal several changes in self-reported psychological states and behaviors. The CES-D score, measuring depressive symptoms, has substantially decreased from 15.0 to 6.0 (Delta = -9.0, Z-score of Delta = -0.86), moving from a moderate range to a low level, suggesting a reduction in reported depressive symptoms. Similarly, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has shown a modest decrease from 44.0 to 40.0 (Delta = -4.0, Z-score of Delta = -0.27). Self-esteem, measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, has also decreased significantly from 48.0 to 40.0 (Delta = -8.0, Z-score of Delta = -1.46), with the current score being below the population average. Self-reported happiness has increased from 3.0 to 4.0 (Delta = 1.0, Z-score of Delta = 0.71). Regarding sleep, the participant now reports a longer sleep latency (15.0 minutes compared to 10.0 minutes, Delta = 5.0 minutes, Z-score of Delta = 0.14) and perceives less control over their sleep duration (changed from ""Somewhat Agree"" to ""Disagree"", Delta = -3.0, Change Z-Score = -1.99). Despite these subjective reports, the normal weekday sleep duration has increased from 6.0 to 7.0 hours (Delta = 1.0 hours, Z-score of Delta = 0.92).

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate some shifts in physiological patterns. Intradaily variability has increased (Delta = 0.2, Z-score of Delta = 1.2), suggesting greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, while Interdaily Stability has decreased (Delta = -0.05, Z-score of Delta = -0.33) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours has decreased (Delta = -0.14, Z-score of Delta = -1.05), indicating a less consistent daily rhythm. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, has increased (Delta = 4.32, Z-score of Delta = 1.17), as has the resting heart rate (Delta = 1.55, Z-score of Delta = 0.37). Conversely, the amplitude, reflecting the extent of daily heart rate variation, has decreased (Delta = -2.32, Z-score of Delta = -0.79). The Acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, has remained unchanged. Aggregated hourly heart rate data show notable increases in average heart rate during many late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 10-11 PM increased by ~8 bpm, 11 PM - 12 AM by ~10 bpm). Sleep statistics from the wearable show a decrease in median sleep duration (6 hours 52 minutes compared to 7 hours 38 minutes, Delta = -46 minutes, Z-score of Delta = -1.06), and a significant shift in the median sleep start time to later in the night (02:27:15 compared to 00:57:00, Delta = 1.5 hours, Z-score of Delta = 1.67).

Behaviorally, there have been substantial increases in sedentary leisure activities. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies has increased from 1-2 hours to over 4 hours (Delta Num = 3.0, Z-Score of Delta = 1.74). Similarly, internet usage has increased significantly from 15 minutes or less to 2-3 hours (Delta Num = 4.0, Z-Score of Delta = 2.57). Socializing with friends has also increased from 1-2 hours to over 4 hours (Delta Num = 3.0, Z-Score of Delta = 2.18), and time spent on sedentary hobbies has risen from 16-30 minutes to over 4 hours (Delta Num = 5.0, Z-Score of Delta = 2.44). Exercise frequency remained consistently high across all categories. Substance usage remains unchanged, with no reported use of beer, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, and consistent usage of wine or liquor 1-2 times per week.

The most prominent positive changes include a significant reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms and a modest decrease in trait anxiety. However, these improvements are counterbalanced by a notable decline in self-esteem and a substantial increase in sedentary leisure activities, particularly screen time. The changes in sleep patterns, with a later sleep onset and reduced overall sleep duration, coupled with increased intradaily heart rate variability and elevated resting and average heart rates during the night, suggest potential disruptions to the participant's sleep and physiological regulation. The initial high PSS score and its moderate negative correlation with changes in PSS (r = -0.56) suggest that a reduction in stress would be expected. However, the observed increase in sedentary behaviors and reported sleep difficulties, alongside decreased self-esteem, are often associated with increased stress. While some psychological measures have improved, the physiological and behavioral data suggest a concerning trend towards less regulated sleep and increased sedentary behavior, which could contribute to heightened stress.

A significant decrease in depressive symptoms is indicated by a CES-D score reduction of 4.0 points (Z-score of Delta: -0.31), accompanied by a substantial decrease in trait anxiety as measured by the STAI, with a score delta of -7.0 (Z-score of Delta: -0.66). Self-esteem has remained relatively stable with a minor decrease of 1.0 point. Interestingly, self-reported happiness has increased by 2.0 points, reaching a Z-score of 1.6. Health satisfaction shows a decrease of 0.89 points, moving from a Z-score of 1.8 to 1.16. Interpersonal trust has seen a marginal increase of 0.17 points.

Regarding sleep, objective sleep duration has slightly decreased by 17 minutes (Z-score of Delta: -0.49), with a notable decrease in the variability of sleep duration (delta of -28 minutes, Z-score of Delta: -0.58). Subjectively, the feeling of control over sleep duration has improved from ""Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Disagree."" Sleep latency remains unchanged. The participant's ideal sleep duration has not changed, but their normal weekday sleep duration has increased by 0.5 hours. Substance usage patterns remain consistent across all measured categories.

In terms of exercise, while exercising alone remains consistent, there has been a decrease in exercising with others, shifting from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" representing a decrease of one session per week. Daily recreational habits show no significant changes, with consistent low engagement in activities such as watching TV, playing video games, and internet usage, all of which remain at minimal or ""do not do"" levels. Socializing with friends has decreased from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes,"" a reduction of one time category. Reading habits and sedentary hobbies remain largely unchanged.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 5.4 bpm (Z-score of Delta: -1.1), indicating improved cardiovascular recovery. The mesor, a measure of average daily heart rate, has also decreased by 2.8 bpm (Z-score of Delta: -0.38), suggesting a lower overall physiological load. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) has shifted earlier in the day from 2:13 PM to 12:41 PM. Circadian rhythm metrics show a slight decrease in interdaily stability and variability. Sleep start times have shifted later by approximately 39 minutes, with a notable decrease in the standard deviation of sleep start times.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is limited. While health satisfaction has decreased, this is a single measure and its correlation with changes in PSS is negligible (-0.04). The decrease in social interaction with friends, although present, also has a low negative correlation (-0.07) with PSS change.

Conversely, substantial evidence suggests an improvement or stability in perceived stress. The significant decreases in both depressive symptoms (CES-D delta correlation: 0.26) and trait anxiety (STAI delta correlation: 0.19) are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. The increase in self-reported happiness, despite its moderate negative correlation with PSS change (-0.14), further supports a positive shift in well-being. The objective physiological improvements, particularly the marked decrease in resting heart rate and mesor, suggest a reduced state of arousal and potentially better stress regulation. The increase in normal weekday sleep duration and improved control over sleep also contribute to a more stable and potentially less stressful baseline. The slightly later sleep start time with reduced variability might reflect a more consistent, albeit later, sleep schedule, which could be associated with reduced stress if it aligns with the individual's lifestyle.

Considering the confluence of improved mental health indicators, reduced physiological stress markers, and more stable sleep patterns, the overall perceived stress score is likely to have improved or remained stable. The positive self-report changes, particularly in anxiety and depression, are strongly correlated with reduced stress, whereas the negative correlations with some of the positive changes (like happiness) are weaker. The significant objective physiological benefits point towards a reduction in the body's stress response.

46365,4.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

Analysis of the provided data reveals several key shifts in the participant's self-reported behaviors, psychological state, and physiological metrics between the two assessment periods. Notably, there is a substantial increase in self-reported depressive symptoms, as indicated by a significant rise in the CES-D score (delta of 14.0, Z-score of delta of 1.68). This coincides with a slight but notable increase in trait anxiety (STAI delta of 3.0, Z-score of delta of 0.63). While self-esteem and happiness levels remained stable, these increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms are psychologically significant.

Behaviorally, there have been pronounced changes in substance usage and recreational activities. The participant has increased their consumption of wine or liquor from less than once a month to 1-2 times a week, and initiated the use of recreational drugs and non-prescribed drugs, moving from no use to 1-2 times a month and less than 1-2 times a month respectively. These increases in substance use are noteworthy, particularly the introduction of recreational and non-prescribed drug use. Concurrently, there has been a substantial decrease in the time spent on internet usage and socializing with friends, with both activities shifting from ""more than 4 hours"" to ""31 minutes an hour."" Furthermore, exercise frequency has shifted, with ""Exercised Alone"" increasing from 1-2 times a month to three times a week or more, while ""Sports"" participation has decreased from 1-2 times a week to 1-2 times a month.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a decrease in resting heart rate (delta of -5.9, Z-score of delta of -1.21), suggesting a potential improvement in cardiovascular health or a reduced physiological stress response at rest. The mesor of the heart rate, representing the central tendency of the daily rhythm, has slightly increased, while the amplitude has decreased. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm has notably declined (delta of -0.2, Z-score of delta of -1.44), indicating a less regular daily pattern of physiological activity. Intradaily variability has remained largely stable. The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted slightly later in the day. Sleep statistics show a slight increase in median sleep duration (delta of 17 minutes), with a decrease in sleep duration variability. The median sleep start time has also shifted slightly earlier, although the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was 20.0, which was below the population average (Z-score of -0.44). The initial PSS score also showed a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) with changes in PSS over time, suggesting that higher initial stress might be associated with subsequent decreases.

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress is primarily derived from the significant increase in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D delta of 14.0, Z-score of delta of 1.68) and a moderate increase in trait anxiety (STAI delta of 3.0, Z-score of delta of 0.63). These psychological indicators often correlate with elevated stress levels. The introduction and increased frequency of substance usage, particularly recreational and non-prescribed drugs, can also be indicative of attempts to cope with or an indicator of increased stress. Furthermore, the decline in interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score of delta of -1.44) suggests a less regulated physiological response, which can be associated with stress.

Evidence for an improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced but present. The resting heart rate has decreased significantly (delta of -5.9, Z-score of delta of -1.21), which could indicate a reduction in physiological arousal. Sleep duration has slightly increased, and the variability of sleep duration has decreased, which might be indicative of more consistent sleep habits. The decrease in internet usage and socializing time could also be interpreted as a reallocation of time away from potentially less fulfilling activities towards more self-focused behaviors, which might indirectly contribute to stress management for some individuals.

However, the strong indicators of worsening mental health (increased depression and anxiety) and the introduction of substance use, coupled with a less stable physiological rhythm, outweigh the potential improvements in resting heart rate and sleep duration. The observed changes in CES-D and STAI scores are particularly salient indicators of increased psychological distress.

72806,-3.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits notable changes across several psychological and behavioral domains, with implications for perceived stress. Self-reported symptoms of depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) have decreased significantly, with the CES-D score reducing by 4.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.31) and the STAI score decreasing by 7.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.66). This indicates a reduction in reported depressive and anxious symptomatology. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has increased substantially, with a score delta of 2.0 (Z-score of delta: 1.55), suggesting an improvement in subjective well-being. Self-esteem has remained largely stable, with a minimal increase of 1.0 point in the score (Z-score of delta: 0.21).

Lifestyle behaviors show mixed trends. The participant reports an increased frequency of exercising alone, moving from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Three times a week or more"" (delta Num: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.91). Conversely, there is a reported increase in overall internet usage, with the time spent shifting from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""31 minutes an hour"" (delta Num: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.55). Socializing with friends has also increased, with reported time increasing from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""1-2 hours"" (delta Num: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.75). While the participant reports a decrease in desired weekday sleep duration by 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta: 0.85), their actual normal weekday sleep duration has also decreased by 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta: -1.11), resulting in a subjective feeling of somewhat agreeing with being in control over sleep duration (delta: 1.0, Change Z-Score: 0.39).

Physiological data from the wearable devices reveal a decrease in resting heart rate by 3.9 bpm (Z-score of delta: -0.78), which is a positive indicator of reduced physiological arousal. The mesor of the circadian rhythm, representing the daily average heart rate, has also decreased (delta: -4.35, Z-score of delta: -0.72). However, the interdaily stability of heart rate has decreased (delta: -0.05, Z-score of delta: -0.33), suggesting a reduction in the regularity of the daily heart rate pattern. The median sleep duration has slightly decreased by 18 minutes (Z-score of delta: -0.51), and the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased significantly by 46 minutes (Z-score of delta: 0.96), indicating a greater variability in when the participant begins their sleep. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a marked increase in heart rate during the 8 PM to 9 PM hour, rising to 100.12 bpm from a previous 78.34 bpm, and a sustained elevated heart rate in the evening hours compared to the previous period, which could indicate periods of higher physiological arousal.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence supporting an increase in perceived stress is limited. While the interdaily stability of the heart rate circadian rhythm has decreased, suggesting a less regular daily physiological pattern, and the standard deviation of sleep start times has increased, indicating greater sleep timing variability, these metrics alone do not definitively point to increased stress.

Conversely, significant evidence suggests an improvement or stability in the participant's perceived stress. The substantial decreases in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. The marked increase in self-reported happiness further supports an improvement in subjective well-being. Physiologically, the decrease in resting heart rate and the mesor of the circadian rhythm suggest a reduction in baseline physiological arousal. While there are increases in internet usage and some evening heart rate elevations, these are counterbalanced by increased exercise and social interaction. The decrease in desired sleep duration, paired with a decrease in actual sleep duration, might suggest a perceived increase in control over sleep, despite the increased variability in sleep onset.

Holistically, the reduction in core indicators of distress (depression, anxiety) and the increase in positive affect (happiness), coupled with physiological signs of reduced arousal, outweigh the limited indicators of increased stress. The changes in sleep regularity and variability, while noteworthy, do not present a compelling case for a significant worsening of perceived stress in light of the positive shifts in mental well-being and physiological markers. Therefore, the participant's perceived stress appears to have either remained stable or decreased.

67918,-6.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notable decrease in self-reported anxiety, as indicated by a significant reduction in the STAI-Trait score (delta of -8.0, with a Z-score of -0.78). Concurrently, there is a substantial improvement in self-esteem, with a decrease of 8.0 points in the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) score (Z-score of Delta: -1.46). While this decrease in RSES score is unexpected given the interpretation of higher scores indicating greater self-esteem, it is a significant behavioral shift. The CES-D score, reflecting depressive symptoms, also decreased by 3.0 points (Z-score of Delta: -0.2), indicating a reduction in reported depressive symptomology. Health satisfaction also saw a decline of 1.0 point (Z-score of Delta: -0.97).

In terms of behavioral habits, there has been an increase in reported alcohol consumption, with a shift from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" for both beer and wine/liquor. This is reflected in positive Z-scores of Delta for Usage Num (1.66 and 1.72 respectively). Conversely, engagement in exercise with others has decreased, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all"" (Delta Num: -2.0, Z-score of Delta: -1.15). There has been a significant increase in time spent on sedentary hobbies, particularly ""Reading"" (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-score of Delta: 1.41) and ""Sedentary Hobby"" (Delta Num: 4.0, Z-score of Delta: 1.93). Conversely, listening to music has increased in duration, with an increase of 1 hour per day (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-score of Delta: 0.52).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 2.9 beats per minute (Z-score of Delta: 0.66). The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, has also increased by 1.19 (Z-score of Delta: 0.49), indicating a higher average heart rate. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm, representing the extent of daily variation, has decreased by 1.79 (Z-score of Delta: -0.61). The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, has shifted earlier, from 4:37 PM to 3:16 PM. The median sleep duration has decreased by 55 minutes (Z-score of Delta: -1.25), and the standard deviation of sleep duration has also reduced by 21 minutes (Z-score of Delta: -0.4). The median sleep start time has shifted later by 54 minutes (Z-score of Delta: 1.0).

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes an increase in resting heart rate and a shift towards a later sleep start time. The decrease in health satisfaction also suggests a potential decline in well-being. While the STAI-Trait score has decreased, indicating reduced anxiety, and the CES-D score has also reduced, pointing to fewer depressive symptoms, these improvements are counterbalanced by other indicators. The significant increase in sedentary hobbies and the decrease in social exercise are behaviors that could contribute to increased stress, despite the reported positive changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is seen in the substantial decrease in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. The decrease in the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score, while appearing counterintuitive given higher scores indicate greater self-esteem, might represent a recalibration or a specific context not captured by the score alone; however, its negative correlation with the change in PSS (-0.06) suggests it might not be a primary driver of stress increase. The increase in listening to music and the earlier acrophase could suggest a shift in daily routine that may be beneficial for some individuals, though its direct impact on stress is unclear without further context. The decrease in sleep duration and its standard deviation, alongside a later sleep start, could indicate poorer sleep quality, which is often associated with increased stress.

Considering the multimodal data, the decrease in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. The increase in resting heart rate and changes in sleep patterns, while concerning, do not definitively point to a worsening of overall perceived stress. The decrease in self-esteem score is a notable factor but its correlation with PSS change is weak. The increase in alcohol consumption and decrease in social exercise are behavioral shifts that warrant attention but their impact on the overall stress level remains ambiguous within this dataset. Given the significant improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms, the overall perceived stress score appears to have remained stable or potentially decreased.

34467,1.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several notable shifts in their psychological and behavioral patterns between the two data collection periods. Self-reported measures indicate a slight increase in trait anxiety (STAI), with scores rising from 33.0 to 34.0, though this remains within the ""not anxious"" classification. Conversely, there is a decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D), moving from a score of 7.0 to 5.0, also remaining in the ""not depressed"" classification. Self-esteem (SelfEsteem) and happiness (Happy) scores remained unchanged, suggesting stability in these core psychological constructs. Trust (Trust) in others has increased significantly, from a previous score of 3.33 to 4.0, placing it well above the population average. Health satisfaction has also seen a modest improvement, increasing from 5.33 to 5.78.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, there has been no change in substance usage. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, remained stable. However, there was a notable reduction in daily internet usage, decreasing from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes,"" and a corresponding decrease in time spent socializing with friends, also falling from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes."" Conversely, time spent reading has increased from no reported activity to ""15 minutes or less."" Sleep habits show a slight decrease in normal weekday sleep duration, from 6.0 hours to 5.5 hours, and no change in the feeling of control over sleep duration, remaining at ""Disagree.""

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased from 46.6 bpm to 42.1 bpm, which is a significant reduction and places them at the lower end of the population distribution. This is accompanied by a substantial increase in the amplitude of their heart rate variability, from 7.15 to 12.81, indicating a wider swing in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor, or average heart rate over the 24-hour period, has slightly increased. However, the acrophase (peak heart rate time) has shifted earlier in the day, from 2:47 PM to 1:09 PM. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a slight improvement in interdaily stability (0.38 to 0.46) and a decrease in intradaily variability (0.78 to 0.63), suggesting a more regular daily pattern of heart rate. Sleep duration has remained largely stable with a minor decrease of 2 minutes in median duration, but the standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased significantly, indicating more consistent sleep length. The median sleep start time has shifted slightly later, and the standard deviation of sleep start time has also decreased considerably, implying more regularity in sleep onset.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The data presents a mixed picture regarding changes that might influence perceived stress. On one hand, the participant reports a decrease in depressive symptoms and a notable increase in trust, alongside improved health satisfaction, which could contribute to lower stress levels. Furthermore, the physiological data indicates a lower resting heart rate and increased amplitude in heart rate variability, potentially reflecting improved stress resilience. The increased interdaily stability and decreased intradaily variability in heart rate also suggest a more regulated daily rhythm, which can be associated with lower stress.

However, there are also factors that might contribute to increased stress. The slight increase in trait anxiety, although remaining within a non-anxious range, is a potential concern. More significantly, there is a decrease in normal weekday sleep duration, and the reported feeling of control over sleep duration has not improved. The reduction in time spent socializing with friends and the decrease in internet usage, while potentially indicative of other positive behavioral shifts, could also represent a reduction in social support or a shift away from stress-reducing activities, though the increase in reading is a positive solitary activity. The correlations between changes in specific metrics and changes in PSS score, though not directive on their own, show some negative associations (e.g., initial PSS with change, self-reported sleep control with change, socializing with friends with change), suggesting that improvements in these areas might be linked to reductions in stress. Conversely, the positive correlation between changes in CES-D and PSS change suggests that while CES-D improved, any minor fluctuations could be associated with stress changes.

Considering the totality of the data, the improvement in several psychological well-being indicators (reduced depression, increased trust, improved health satisfaction) and positive physiological adjustments (lower resting heart rate, improved circadian rhythm regularity) are strong indicators of a potential decrease in perceived stress. While there are minor changes in sleep and social interaction that warrant attention, they do not appear to outweigh the benefits observed in other domains. The substantial decrease in resting heart rate and improved sleep regularity are particularly indicative of a positive shift in stress management.

The participant exhibits several notable changes in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods. Self-reported anxiety, measured by the STAI, has significantly decreased, with a score delta of -12.0 and a z-score of delta of -1.3, indicating a substantial reduction in trait anxiety proneness. Similarly, depressive symptoms, as assessed by the CES-D, have shown a marked decrease (score delta of -5.0, z-score of delta of -0.42), moving from a moderate level to a non-depressed classification. Self-esteem has experienced a slight decline (score delta of -5.0, z-score of delta of -0.9), however, it remains at a relatively high level (current z-score of 1.06). While trust in others has increased (score delta of 0.67, z-score of delta of 1.55), self-reported happiness has decreased (score delta of -1.0, z-score of delta of -0.96).

Changes in lifestyle behaviors are also evident. There has been an increase in beer consumption, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Three times a week or more"" (delta num of 2.0, z-score of delta of 1.66), and recreational drug usage has been initiated, moving from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (delta num of 1.0, z-score of delta of 1.97). Conversely, exercise with others has decreased in frequency, shifting from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta num of -1.0, z-score of delta of -0.43). Internet usage has increased notably, from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""2-3 hours"" (delta num of 2.0, z-score of delta of 1.22), while socialising with friends has also increased in time spent (delta num of 1.0, z-score of delta of 0.75). Reading for leisure has been initiated, moving from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (delta num of 1.0, z-score of delta of 0.6).

Physiological metrics reveal a trend towards increased regularity in daily rhythms. Interdaily Stability has improved (delta of 0.15, z-score of delta of 1.15), suggesting a more consistent daily pattern. Intradaily Variability has also increased (delta of 0.17, z-score of delta of 0.99), which, in conjunction with increased interdaily stability, may suggest a more structured, albeit potentially more active, daily routine. The participant's resting heart rate has slightly decreased (delta of -1.5, z-score of delta of -0.28), and the amplitude of their heart rate variation has increased (delta of 2.1, z-score of delta of 0.71), indicating a larger fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a general increase in heart rate during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 12-1 am, 1-2 am) compared to the previous period, with some periods showing substantial increases (e.g., 12-1 am: +7.72 bpm, 1-2 am: +6.49 bpm, 8-9 pm: +13.63 bpm, 9-10 pm: +7.4 bpm). Conversely, some daytime hours have seen a decrease in average heart rate. Sleep duration has slightly decreased by 9 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep duration has increased, suggesting more variability in sleep length. The standard deviation of sleep start time has significantly increased, more than doubling from 98 minutes to 172 minutes (z-score of delta of 1.52), indicating a substantial loss of consistency in when the participant initiates sleep.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes the observed increase in alcohol (beer) consumption, the initiation of recreational drug use, and a significant increase in the variability of sleep start times. The decrease in self-reported happiness, despite reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, is also a potential indicator of increased stress. Furthermore, the increased amplitude in heart rate variation, along with elevated hourly heart rates during late evening and nighttime hours, could reflect increased physiological arousal or stress response during these periods, especially when considered alongside the increased variability in sleep initiation.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is suggested by the substantial decrease in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, moving the participant into more favorable psychological states. The increase in trust and the initiation of reading as a leisure activity could also contribute to a more stable or improved psychological well-being.

Holistically, while there are positive shifts in psychological well-being markers like reduced anxiety and depression, the concerning trends in substance use, particularly the increase in beer consumption and initiation of recreational drug use, coupled with a significant decline in the consistency of sleep timing, point towards potential increases in perceived stress. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that higher initial stress might be associated with a decrease, but the current data presents a mixed picture. However, the behavioral changes, particularly regarding substance use and sleep regularity, carry a higher weight in indicating an increase in overall perceived stress. The increased variability in sleep start times is particularly indicative of a disrupted daily rhythm, which is often associated with higher stress levels.

The participant exhibits several notable changes in their psychological and behavioral patterns between the two data collection periods. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, have significantly decreased, shifting from a score indicating mild depressive symptoms to one well below the clinical threshold. Concurrently, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, has also shown a marked reduction, moving from a state categorized as anxious to one considered not anxious. Self-esteem remained stable. Health satisfaction has decreased slightly, although the participant's Body Mass Index has marginally increased. Regarding sleep, subjective reports indicate no change in sleep latency or ideal sleep duration, nor any change in the perceived control over sleep duration, though the participant's feeling of control over sleep duration has shifted from ""Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Disagree,"" indicating a slight decrease in perceived control. Objective sleep duration, as measured by Fitbit, has slightly increased.

Substance usage patterns remain consistent, with no changes in the frequency of beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are also stable in terms of frequency for exercising alone and sports. However, exercising with others has increased in frequency. Daily recreational habits show a notable shift in internet usage, with a substantial increase from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""31 minutes an hour."" Socializing with friends has also increased, moving from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""31 minutes an hour."" Sedentary hobbies have also increased from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less.""

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 5 beats per minute, moving from a lower than average resting heart rate to one closer to the population average, yet still below average. The mesor, a measure of the average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle, has also increased, indicating a higher average heart rate. Conversely, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has decreased significantly, suggesting a blunting of the daily variation in heart rate. This reduction in amplitude is accompanied by a later acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate occurs later in the day. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity show a decrease in interdaily stability and intradaily variability, and a notable decrease in autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggesting a less consistent and structured daily rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal an overall increase in heart rate during nighttime hours and a more pronounced elevation during late afternoon and early evening hours in the current period compared to the previous period.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is suggested by the increase in resting heart rate and the elevated mean heart rate during nighttime and late afternoon/early evening hours, despite a decrease in the amplitude of the circadian rhythm. The decrease in interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours also points to a less regulated physiological rhythm, which can be associated with heightened stress. Furthermore, the increase in internet usage and a slight decrease in perceived control over sleep duration could be indicative of a less adaptive coping strategy or increasing stressors.

Conversely, significant evidence points towards a decrease or stability in perceived stress. The most compelling indicators are the substantial reductions in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI). These are direct measures of psychological distress, and their significant decrease strongly suggests an improvement in overall well-being. The stability in self-esteem, while not an improvement, indicates a lack of worsening in this domain. The increased frequency of exercising with others and increased social interactions with friends can also be protective factors against stress.

Holistically, the substantial decrease in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms strongly outweighs the physiological indicators that might suggest increased stress. These psychological improvements are direct measures of perceived distress, indicating a positive shift. While physiological markers like resting heart rate have increased, and circadian rhythm regularity has decreased, these could be influenced by factors other than stress, or represent an adaptation rather than a decline in well-being, especially in the context of improved psychological states. The positive changes in social engagement and exercise further support a trend towards reduced stress. Therefore, the overall perceived stress has likely decreased or remained stable.

The participant's self-reported psychological measures indicate a trend towards reduced subjective distress. Specifically, the CES-D score has decreased by 2.0 points, moving from a ""Not depressed"" classification to a lower score within that category, suggesting a reduction in reported depressive symptoms. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score has decreased by 2.0 points, also remaining within the ""not anxious"" classification but indicating a decrease in proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem has seen a modest increase of 1.0 point on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with the current score of 45.0 being above average for the study population (Z-score of 1.06). Trust in others has also slightly increased by 0.17 points. Conversely, reported happiness has remained stable at a score of 3.0, which is below the population average. Health satisfaction has slightly decreased by 0.44 points, moving from a more satisfied to a less satisfied position relative to the study population, though still above average.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, there has been a notable decrease in the frequency of beer consumption, shifting from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (a reduction of 1.0 usage unit, with a significant Z-score of -1.23). Other substance usage remains stable. Regarding exercise, there has been a decrease in exercising with others, moving from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (a decrease of 2.0 frequency units, with a Z-score of -1.15). However, participation in sports has increased from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (an increase of 2.0 frequency units, with a Z-score of 1.6). Daily recreational habits show a slight increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, while time spent on internet usage and listening to music has decreased. Socializing with friends and reading have remained stable in terms of reported time spent.

Analysis of wearable-derived metrics reveals mixed patterns in physiological regulation and sleep. Interdaily stability, a measure of circadian rhythm regularity, has decreased from 0.47 to 0.40 (Z-score of -0.48 for the change), indicating a slight reduction in the consistency of daily activity patterns. This is accompanied by an increase in intradaily variability from 0.34 to 0.45 (Z-score of 0.56 for the change), suggesting more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has increased from 0.38 to 0.48 (Z-score of 0.59 for the change), which might reflect a slight re-entrainment of the circadian rhythm to a 24-hour cycle. The acrophase, the peak of the rhythm, has shifted earlier by 29 minutes. The mesor, the daily average heart rate, has slightly decreased by 1.77 bpm, but remains above population average. The amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation, has also slightly decreased. Resting heart rate has decreased by 3.3 bpm, moving towards the population average. Median sleep duration has decreased by 20 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep duration has increased by 25 minutes, indicating more variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time has shifted earlier by 25 minutes, while the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased by 14 minutes, suggesting less consistent sleep onset.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant's self-report data indicates an improvement in several key psychological indicators associated with stress. Reductions in reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) suggest a decrease in psychological distress. The increase in self-esteem also contributes to a more positive psychological profile. These improvements are offset by a slight decrease in health satisfaction and stable reported happiness, suggesting a nuanced overall picture.

Behavioral changes present a mixed pattern. The significant reduction in alcohol consumption and the increase in sports participation are positive indicators of engagement in health-promoting behaviors. However, the decrease in exercising with others and the increase in screen time activities like watching TV and playing video games may represent a shift towards more sedentary or solitary leisure, which can sometimes be associated with higher stress levels.

Physiological data from wearables present a complex scenario. The decrease in interdaily stability and increase in intradaily variability of heart rate suggest a less regular circadian rhythm, potentially indicating physiological dysregulation. While the resting heart rate has decreased, which is generally a positive sign, the increased variability in sleep duration and start time, alongside the overall reduction in sleep duration, points towards poorer sleep quality. Poorer sleep is a well-established contributor to increased perceived stress. The mesor and amplitude also indicate a slight reduction in overall physiological activity, but this is within a context of reduced regularity.

Considering the correlation data provided as guidance, the changes in CES-D (Delta Correlation: 0.26) and STAI (Delta Correlation: 0.19) show a positive correlation with changes in PSS, suggesting that improvements in these domains are associated with potential increases in PSS. Conversely, changes in sleep duration (Delta Correlation: -0.09), control over sleep (Delta Correlation: -0.07), and median sleep start time (Delta Correlation: -0.18) show negative correlations, implying that deteriorations in these areas might be associated with decreases in PSS. The decrease in median sleep duration and increased variability in sleep patterns, coupled with the reduction in interdaily stability and increase in intradaily variability of heart rate, represent significant negative shifts that are often associated with elevated stress. Despite the positive self-report changes in mood and anxiety, the decline in sleep quality and circadian rhythm regularity are strong indicators of potential stress escalation. The initial PSS score's negative correlation with change (-0.56) suggests that individuals with higher initial PSS scores are more likely to experience a decrease in PSS over time. Since this participant's initial PSS was close to average, this correlation doesn't strongly predict a decrease.

Given the contradictory signals, a holistic evaluation is necessary. While self-reported mood and anxiety have improved, the objective measures of sleep quality and circadian rhythm regularity have deteriorated. Sleep disturbance and circadian disruption are potent drivers of perceived stress. The decrease in sleep duration and the increased variability in sleep onset are particularly concerning. Therefore, despite some positive self-reported changes, the physiological and sleep data suggest a trend towards increased stress.

72348,-1.0,"The participant exhibits a notable increase in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a substantial rise in their CES-D score. This change is accompanied by an increase in trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, moving from a classification of ""not anxious"" to ""anxious."" Self-esteem, while still within a generally positive range, has seen a modest increase, though its correlation with changes in perceived stress is negligible. Subjectively, the participant reports a longer sleep latency, taking 10 minutes longer to fall asleep. Concurrently, their reported normal weekday sleep duration has decreased by 0.5 hours, moving away from the population average. A decrease in perceived control over sleep duration is also observed, aligning with a slight increase in sleep latency. Trust in others has shown a moderate increase. Health satisfaction has also seen a slight improvement. Substance usage and recreational drug use remain at zero. Exercise frequency alone has increased, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" a significant positive behavioral shift. However, daily recreational habits indicate an increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies and a decrease in time spent on video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, and sedentary hobbies.

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal a shift in the timing of the daily peak heart rate (acrophase) to later in the afternoon. While the average daily heart rate (MESOR) has slightly decreased, the variability around this average (Amplitude) has increased, suggesting a greater fluctuation in physiological arousal throughout the day. The resting heart rate has also decreased. The regularity of the participant's daily activity rhythm, as indicated by Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours, remained stable, with Intradaily Variability showing a slight increase. Sleep duration, both median and standard deviation, and sleep start time consistency have shown minimal changes.

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score has an initial correlation of -0.56 with changes to itself, suggesting that individuals with higher initial PSS scores tend to experience greater decreases in PSS over time. The participant's initial PSS score was 22.0, which is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.1).

Analyzing the available evidence:

Evidence for worsening perceived stress:
*   **Increased Depressive Symptoms (CES-D):** The CES-D score increased by 7.0 points, moving towards a higher symptom burden. The Z-score of this change (0.91) indicates a substantial increase relative to the population.
*   **Increased Trait Anxiety (STAI):** The STAI score increased by 4.0 points, shifting the classification from ""not anxious"" to ""anxious."" The Z-score of this change (0.76) signifies a notable rise in proneness to anxiety.
*   **Increased Sleep Latency:** The self-reported time to fall asleep increased by 10 minutes, a change with a Z-score of 0.44, indicating a moderate increase.
*   **Decreased Normal Weekday Sleep Duration:** Self-reported normal weekday sleep duration decreased by 0.5 hours, with a negative Z-score of -0.6, suggesting a deviation from healthier sleep patterns.
*   **Decreased Feeling of Control over Sleep:** The participant's sense of control over sleep duration has decreased.
*   **Increased TV/Video/Movie Watching:** Time spent on this activity increased by 1.0 unit, with a Z-score of 0.46, suggesting a potential increase in passive leisure time.
*   **Decreased Socializing with Friends:** Time spent socializing decreased by 1.0 unit, with a Z-score of -0.68, potentially indicating reduced social support.
*   **Increased Intradaily Variability in Heart Rate:** This metric increased by 0.11 (Z-score of 0.56), suggesting greater fluctuations in physiological arousal throughout the day, which can be associated with stress.

Evidence for improvement or stability of PSS score:
*   **Increased Self-Esteem:** Self-esteem scores increased by 3.0 points, although this change has a negligible correlation with PSS change.
*   **Increased Trust:** Interpersonal trust increased by 0.33, with a Z-score of 0.72, indicating a more positive outlook on others.
*   **Increased Exercise Frequency:** The frequency of exercising alone has significantly increased, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" This is a positive behavioral change.
*   **Decreased Resting Heart Rate:** The resting heart rate decreased by 3.1 bpm, with a Z-score of -0.61, which is generally indicative of improved cardiovascular health and potentially lower physiological stress.
*   **Decreased MESOR:** The average daily heart rate (MESOR) has decreased by 2.6 units, with a Z-score of -0.34, suggesting a slight reduction in overall physiological load.
*   **Stable Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation:** These measures of daily rhythm regularity remained stable, indicating consistent daily patterns.
*   **Stable BMI:** Body Mass Index remained unchanged.
*   **Unchanged Happiness Score:** The self-reported happiness score remained stable.
*   **Health Satisfaction Improvement:** Health satisfaction increased by 0.33.

Holistic Analysis:
The participant demonstrates a mixed profile. While there are positive indicators such as increased self-esteem, trust, exercise frequency, and improvements in resting heart rate and health satisfaction, these are overshadowed by significant increases in negative psychological indicators. The substantial rise in depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with increased sleep latency and reduced perceived control over sleep, points towards an escalating internal stress burden. The reduction in social interaction time further suggests a potential decrease in coping resources. The increased variability in heart rate throughout the day also aligns with a state of heightened physiological stress. Despite some positive behavioral and physiological shifts, the evidence strongly suggests a worsening of perceived stress due to the prominent increases in negative affect and sleep disturbances.

**Self-Reported Psychological and Lifestyle Changes:**
The participant's self-reported psychological state has demonstrated a notable shift. While initial scores indicated mild anxiety (STAI T-score of 48), this has since decreased to 43, moving the participant from a higher percentile to a more moderate anxiety proneness. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, have also slightly reduced from a score of 14 to 13, remaining within the ""not depressed"" classification and indicating a slight decrease in symptom frequency. Self-esteem has seen a marginal increase, with the score rising from 35 to 36. Health satisfaction, however, has experienced a decrease, moving from a score of 4.0 to 3.67, suggesting a decline in the participant's perception of their physical health. Similarly, the feeling of control over sleep duration has diminished, shifting from ""Somewhat Agree"" to ""Neither Agree nor Disagree.""

**Behavioral Habit Modifications:**
Significant alterations in daily recreational habits are evident. There has been a marked increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""1-2 hours,"" and a comparable escalation in video game engagement, from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""31 minutes an hour."" Internet usage has also increased from ""1-2 hours"" to ""2-3 hours."" Listening to music has seen a slight rise in duration, and engagement in sedentary hobbies has emerged, starting from ""Do not do"" to ""16-30 minutes."" Conversely, the frequency of exercising with others has decreased, from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month."" Notably, substance usage patterns, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, have remained consistent, indicating no change in these behaviors.

**Sleep Pattern Changes:**
The participant's sleep duration has increased, with the median sleep duration rising from 7 hours and 35 minutes to 8 hours and 14 minutes. This aligns with an increased desired weekday sleep time, which has moved from 7 hours to 8 hours. Concurrently, the variability in sleep duration, as indicated by the standard deviation, has substantially decreased from 123 minutes to 36 minutes, suggesting a more consistent sleep pattern. The median sleep start time has also shifted later by 26 minutes, from 01:23:30 to 01:49:30.

**Wearable-Derived Physiological and Circadian Rhythm Data:**
Physiological data reveal a considerable increase in intraday variability of heart rate, rising from 0.46 to 0.69, while interdaily stability has slightly decreased from 0.50 to 0.49. The autocorrelation at 24 hours has significantly decreased from 0.44 to 0.19, suggesting a weaker day-to-day pattern in heart rate. The mesor, a measure of the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, has decreased from 84.87 to 71.98, indicating a lower overall heart rate. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has also decreased from 16.16 to 11.45. The resting heart rate has shown a minor decrease from 61.0 to 60.4 bpm. Aggregated hourly heart rate data indicate a substantial reduction in elevated heart rates during nighttime hours (12 AM - 5 AM) and a reduction in peak heart rates during afternoon and evening hours (12 PM - 8 PM) compared to the previous period.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress (increase) is primarily indicated by the decrease in health satisfaction and the diminished sense of control over sleep duration. The significant increase in sedentary recreational activities, particularly video games and watching TV/videos/movies, may also contribute to a perception of reduced well-being. Furthermore, the increase in intraday heart rate variability and a decrease in 24-hour autocorrelation suggest a less regulated physiological state, which could be associated with increased stress.

Conversely, evidence for the improvement or stability of perceived stress (decrease/stable) is suggested by the reduction in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, alongside a slight increase in self-esteem. The substantial increase in overall sleep duration and a significant decrease in the variability of sleep duration point towards improved sleep hygiene, which is typically associated with lower stress levels. The decrease in mesor and amplitude, coupled with lower resting heart rate and reduced elevated heart rates throughout the day and night, indicates a less physiologically aroused state, which is generally indicative of reduced stress. The initial PSS score of 23.0, which is slightly above the mean (Z-Score of 0.38), combined with a negative correlation (-0.56) between the initial score and changes in PSS, suggests that individuals starting with higher stress levels might experience a reduction over time. Given the mixed indicators, a holistic evaluation is necessary.

The decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, improved sleep duration and consistency, and the overall reduction in physiological arousal (lower resting heart rate, mesor, and amplitude) strongly suggest a trend towards reduced perceived stress. While some lifestyle indicators and a decrease in health satisfaction present a counterpoint, the robust improvements in psychological well-being and physiological regulation are more indicative of a stress reduction. Therefore, the overall direction of change in the participant's perceived stress is assessed as improving or stable.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
26800,4.0,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

**Psychological and Trait Measures:**

The participant exhibits a significant reduction in trait anxiety, with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score decreasing from 40.0 (Z-score -0.13, classified as anxious) to 30.0 (Z-score -1.01, classified as not anxious). This represents a substantial improvement, reflected in a Z-score of change of -1.04. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has increased from a Z-score of -0.53 to 1.60, with a corresponding Z-score of change of 1.55, indicating a more positive emotional state. Self-esteem also shows a positive trend, increasing from a previous Z-score of 0.96 to a current Z-score of 1.79, with a Z-score of change of 0.95. These shifts suggest a notable improvement in subjective well-being and a reduction in chronic anxiety.

**Sleep Habits and Perceptions:**

Subjective sleep quality appears to have improved. Sleep latency has decreased by 5.0 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.46), and the participant reports a greater feeling of control over their sleep duration, with a shift from 'Somewhat Agree' to 'Strongly Agree' (Z-score of change 0.98). This aligns with an increase in the desired and normal weekday sleep duration, each increasing by 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta 0.85 and 0.92 respectively). Objective sleep duration, as measured by median Fitbit sleep duration, has also increased by 30 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.44).

**Behavioral Habits and Lifestyle:**

Significant positive changes in physical activity have been observed. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, has substantially increased. Exercising alone has moved from 'Less than 1-2 times a month' to '1-2 times a week' (Z-score of delta 1.77), and exercising with others has shifted from 'Not at all' to '1-2 times a month' (Z-score of delta 1.71). Conversely, participation in sports has decreased from '1-2 times a week' to 'Not at all' (Z-score of delta -1.85). There has been an increase in video game usage, from no reported use to '31 minutes an hour' (Z-score of delta 2.09). Notably, the participant has reduced their consumption of wine or liquor from '1-2 times a week' to '1-2 times a month' (Z-score of delta -1.25).

**Wearable-Derived Physiological and Circadian Metrics:**

The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits increased regularity and structure. Interdaily stability has improved significantly, increasing from 0.22 to 0.54 (Z-score of delta 2.41), suggesting a more consistent daily pattern. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has nearly doubled, increasing from 6.06 to 12.74 (Z-score of delta 2.26), indicating a greater range between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day, which may reflect increased physiological engagement. While the mesor, representing the average heart rate, has slightly decreased, this is within a relatively stable range. The resting heart rate has increased by 2.6 bpm, from 47.8 to 50.4, which is still within the lower range relative to the population Z-score of -1.01. The median sleep start time has become earlier by 32 minutes, suggesting a potential shift towards earlier bedtimes.

### Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

**Evidence for Worsening Perceived Stress:**

There is limited direct evidence suggesting a worsening of perceived stress. The Resting Heart Rate has increased by 2.6 bpm, and while not excessively high, this could be indicative of increased physiological arousal. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has significantly increased, suggesting a wider fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which can sometimes be associated with higher stress levels.

**Evidence for Improvement or Stability in Perceived Stress:**

The evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is substantial. Most notably, the participant shows a significant decrease in trait anxiety (STAI score reduction of 10 points and a Z-score of change of -1.04), moving from an anxious classification to not anxious. Self-reported happiness has increased considerably (Z-score of change 1.55), and self-esteem has also shown a positive trend (Z-score of change 0.95). Subjective sleep quality indicators have improved, with reduced sleep latency and increased perceived control over sleep. Objectively, median sleep duration has increased by 30 minutes. Significant increases in exercise frequency, both alone and with others, alongside a decrease in alcohol consumption (wine or liquor), are positive lifestyle changes that typically buffer stress. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm has become more stable (Interdaily Stability Z-score of delta 2.41), indicating better synchronization between daily activities and physiological rhythms. The earlier median sleep start time also suggests a move towards more regular sleep patterns.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The participant's data indicates a clear trend towards reduced perceived stress. The significant improvements in anxiety, happiness, and self-esteem, coupled with positive changes in sleep habits and lifestyle behaviors such as increased exercise and reduced alcohol intake, strongly suggest a reduction in stress. While there are some physiological indicators like increased heart rate amplitude that might warrant monitoring, they are outweighed by the substantial improvements in psychological well-being and behavioral patterns. The increased stability of circadian rhythms further supports a more regulated and less stressful state. Therefore, the overall perceived stress has likely decreased.

60396,-1.0,"Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits notable changes across several psychological and behavioral domains, with some indicators suggesting increased stress. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has increased from a score of 42.0 to 46.0, moving from the lower to the upper quartile of the anxious classification range. Concurrently, depressive symptoms, assessed by the CES-D, have doubled from a score of 8.0 to 14.0, though remaining within the ""Not depressed"" classification. Health satisfaction has significantly decreased, with a substantial drop from a Z-score of 0.88 to -2.23. Substance usage patterns have also shifted, with an increase in beer consumption to ""Three times a week or more"" and a decrease in wine or liquor consumption to ""1-2 times a month."" Recreational drug use has been initiated, moving from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month."" Exercise habits show an increase in individual exercise frequency, moving to ""Three times a week or more,"" while participation in sports has decreased. Daily recreational habits indicate a reduction in time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, with both now falling into the ""15 minutes or less"" category.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 7.9 beats per minute, with a corresponding increase in the Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) from 62.11 to 70.65. The Z-score for Mesor has shifted from -1.67 to -0.45, indicating a relative increase in the central tendency of heart rate. Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability, has decreased, with Interdaily Stability dropping from 0.37 to 0.18 (Z-score of Delta -1.36) and Intradaily Variability decreasing from 0.46 to 0.20 (Z-score of Delta -2.06). Autocorrelation at 24 hours has also significantly decreased, from 0.31 to 0.02 (Z-score of Delta -2.07). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier in the day, from 6:18 PM to 2:30 PM. Sleep duration, both self-reported and Fitbit-measured, has decreased. The median sleep duration from Fitbit data has reduced by over an hour, and self-reported normal weekday sleep duration has decreased by 0.5 hours. Notably, the standard deviation of sleep start time has dramatically increased from 53 minutes to 153 minutes, suggesting a significant disruption in sleep timing regularity.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is present in several key areas. The increase in STAI scores indicates a rise in chronic anxiety proneness. The significant decrease in health satisfaction, moving from above average to a substantially low Z-score, is a strong indicator of diminished well-being. The observed physiological changes, including an elevated resting heart rate and Mesor, alongside decreased circadian rhythm stability (Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours), point towards a more stressed physiological state. The marked increase in the standard deviation of sleep start times strongly suggests disrupted sleep patterns, which are frequently associated with elevated stress. While depressive symptoms (CES-D) remain in the ""Not depressed"" range, their doubling warrants attention. The shift in recreational drug usage also indicates a potential coping mechanism or increased engagement with potentially stress-related behaviors.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less prominent. Self-esteem has remained relatively stable with a small increase in score. Happiness levels are unchanged. While wine/liquor consumption has decreased, and TV/video game usage has been reduced, these changes are offset by increases in other potentially stress-associated activities (beer, recreational drugs). The increase in individual exercise frequency is a positive change, but the decrease in sports participation might represent a reduction in social or recreational engagement.

Holistically, the convergence of increased anxiety, decreased health satisfaction, physiological indicators of stress (elevated heart rate, reduced circadian regularity), and significant sleep disruption suggests a worsening of the participant's overall perceived stress. The initial PSS score of 21.0, with a correlation of -0.56 with its change, suggests that lower initial PSS scores were associated with increases in PSS over time, which aligns with the observed trend towards increased stress.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
92412,3.0,"This analysis examines changes in a university student's psychological and behavioral data across two time periods, approximately two years apart, focusing on perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant initially presented with a relatively low PSS score (16.0, Z-score -1.53).

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

**Self-Reported Psychological and Lifestyle Factors:**
The participant reported a decrease in anxiety as measured by the STAI (Trait), with a score change of -4.0 (Z-score of delta -0.27), moving from 32.0 to 28.0. This decrease in anxiety is not significantly correlated with changes in PSS (correlation 0.19). Self-esteem remained largely stable with a slight decrease of 1.0 point (Z-score of delta -0.16), moving from 44.0 to 43.0, and this change shows a weak negative correlation with PSS changes (-0.06). Depression symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, remained stable at 3.0 (Z-score of delta 0.13), with no change observed from the previous measurement period. Interpersonal trust showed a slight increase of 0.33 points (Z-score of delta 0.72). Overall health satisfaction significantly improved by 1.0 point (Z-score of delta 0.87), moving from 5.11 to 6.11. Self-reported happiness remained stable at 5.0.

**Sleep Habits:**
Objective sleep duration, as indicated by Fitbit's median sleep duration, increased by 32 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.49), from 7 hours 48 minutes to 8 hours 20 minutes. This increase is weakly positively correlated with PSS changes (0.02). Notably, the standard deviation of sleep duration significantly decreased by 39 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.83), suggesting more consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time shifted earlier by 25 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.52), and the standard deviation of sleep start time also decreased substantially by 34 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.66), indicating improved sleep regularity. Subjectively, the participant's feeling of control over sleep duration decreased, moving from ""Strongly Agree"" to ""Agree"" (delta -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.8), with a weak negative correlation to PSS changes (-0.07). Ideal weekday sleep time increased by 0.5 hours (Z-score of delta 0.46), and normal weekday sleep duration also increased by 0.5 hours (Z-score of delta 0.41).

**Physical Activity and Daily Habits:**
The participant increased their substance usage. Beer consumption shifted from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta Num 2.0, Z-score of delta 1.66), and wine or liquor usage similarly shifted from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta Num 2.0, Z-score of delta 1.72). These increases in substance use are weakly negatively correlated with PSS changes (-0.06 and -0.00 respectively). Exercise habits showed mixed changes. Exercising alone remained consistent at ""Three times a week or more."" However, exercising with others significantly decreased from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""Not at all"" (delta Num -4.0, Z-score of delta -2.58). Sports participation remained stable at ""1-2 times a week."" Daily recreation habits saw a significant reduction in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""Do not do"" (delta Num -2.0, Z-score of delta -1.46). Listening to music also decreased from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""Do not do"" (delta Num -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.54).

**Wearable Physiological Metrics:**
Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a notable shift in the acrophase (peak of the rhythm) occurring earlier in the day, from 6:32 PM to 4:31 PM. The Mesor, representing the overall average heart rate, decreased by 4.42 bpm (Z-score of delta -0.73), moving from 68.53 to 64.11. This decrease is weakly negatively correlated with PSS changes (-0.01). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm showed a slight increase (delta 0.39, Z-score of delta 0.13). Resting heart rate also decreased by 3.6 bpm (Z-score of delta -0.72), from 53.8 to 50.2, with a weak negative correlation to PSS changes (-0.01). Interdaily stability of heart rate increased (delta 0.06, Z-score of delta 0.48), suggesting a more regular daily pattern. Intradaily variability and autocorrelation at 24 hours remained stable.

**Aggregated Hourly Heart Rate Analysis:**
Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant differences between the two periods. The previous period exhibited substantially higher heart rates across most hours, particularly during the evening and nighttime. For instance, the 11 PM to 12 AM hour was 66.04 bpm currently versus 74.03 previously. The 4 PM to 5 PM hour currently shows an exceptionally high average of 99.92 bpm, significantly higher than the previous period's 75.72 bpm for the same hour. However, other peak hours like 3 PM to 4 PM (74.19 vs 70.15) and 8 PM to 9 PM (74.55 vs 77.8) show less dramatic or even slightly lower current averages compared to previous. Notably, the early morning hours (1 AM to 7 AM) show considerably lower current average heart rates compared to the previous period, suggesting a more pronounced difference between rest and activity periods.

**Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant's initial PSS score was relatively low, suggesting a baseline of lower perceived stress. Several factors suggest a potential improvement or stability in perceived stress. The decrease in anxiety (STAI), increased health satisfaction, and improved objective sleep regularity (reduced sleep duration and start time variability) are all positive indicators. The decrease in resting heart rate and Mesor also suggests a reduction in physiological arousal.

However, some behaviors suggest potential increases in stress. The significant increase in beer and wine/liquor consumption, and the substantial decrease in exercising with others, are concerning. The exceptionally high peak heart rate in the 4-5 PM hour warrants further attention, although its correlation with PSS change is not provided. While objective sleep duration increased, subjective control over sleep duration decreased. The acrophase shifting earlier might indicate a biological rhythm shift, the implications of which on stress are not directly clear from the data.

Considering the initial low PSS score and the presence of several indicators of improved well-being (reduced anxiety, improved sleep regularity, decreased resting heart rate), the overall direction of change in perceived stress appears to be towards stability or a decrease. While the increase in substance use is a negative indicator, the magnitude of positive changes in other domains, particularly those related to stress regulation like anxiety and sleep, suggests a net improvement or stability.

14737,-4.0,"The participant exhibits several notable changes in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has significantly decreased, with a score delta of -13.0 and a Z-score of the delta of -1.43. Correspondingly, depressive symptoms, assessed by the CES-D, have also substantially reduced, showing a score delta of -8.0 and a Z-score of the delta of -0.75. While self-esteem has increased (Score Delta: 6.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.13), the correlation with changes in perceived stress is negative (-0.06), suggesting this increase may not be directly linked to stress reduction. Health satisfaction has seen a moderate improvement (Score Delta: 0.56, Z-Score of Delta: 0.46).

Significant shifts are also evident in behavioral habits. There is a notable increase in alcohol consumption, with both ""beer"" and ""wine or liquor"" usage escalating from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" indicated by positive delta Z-scores of 1.66 and 1.72, respectively. Physical activity shows a mixed pattern: exercising alone has increased in frequency (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.91), while exercising with others has also increased from near absence to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.0). Sports participation remains unchanged. Recreational screen time has increased, particularly in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.74) and ""Video Games"" (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.64). Conversely, time spent on ""Socializing with Friends"" has increased significantly (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.47), alongside a decrease in ""Sedentary Hobby"" time (Delta Num: -3.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.68).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm appears more regular, with ""Interdaily Stability"" increasing from 0.4 to 0.55 (Z-Score of Delta: 1.15) and ""Autocorrelation at 24 Hours"" increasing from 0.22 to 0.37 (Z-Score of Delta: 0.93). This suggests a more structured daily pattern. The mean heart rate (Mesor) has decreased (Delta: -4.26, Z-Score of Delta: -0.7), and the resting heart rate has also slightly decreased (Delta: -0.7, Z-Score of Delta: -0.11). Sleep duration has increased by over an hour (Delta: '1 hours 2 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: 1.07), and the variability in sleep duration has decreased substantially (Delta: '-44 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: -0.95). However, the median sleep start time has slightly shifted later by 9 minutes. The aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates a general increase in heart rate during waking hours, particularly in the afternoon and early evening, relative to the previous period. For example, the 1-2 PM hour increased from 77.41 to 85.41, and the 5-6 PM hour increased from 83.26 to 80.79. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is lower, but the peak heart rates during the day are higher.

Considering the multimodal data, several factors suggest a potential reduction in perceived stress. The significant decreases in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms are strong indicators. The improvement in health satisfaction and the increase in social connection and exercise duration also point towards a more positive psychological state. The increased sleep duration and reduced sleep variability are also generally associated with lower stress. While there are increases in alcohol consumption and certain screen-based activities, these are offset by the positive changes in other areas. The elevated heart rates during specific daytime hours could indicate periods of heightened physiological arousal, but without direct PSS correlation data for these specific hourly metrics, it is challenging to definitively link them to stress. The decrease in the Mesor and resting heart rate, however, suggests an overall calming of the physiological system.

Self-reported measures reveal a marked increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D score delta of +15.0, Z-score delta of 1.79) and anxiety (STAI score delta of +17.0, Z-score delta of 2.43). Concurrently, self-esteem has declined substantially, with a score delta of -14.0 (Z-score delta of -2.57), and health satisfaction has also decreased (score delta of -1.56, Z-score delta of -1.49). Trust in others has diminished, as indicated by a score delta of -1.0 (Z-score delta of -2.58). There are notable changes in sleep habits, with a decrease in normal weekday sleep duration by 1.0 hour (Z-score delta of -1.11) and a reduction in the feeling of control over sleep duration (delta of 2.0, Z-score delta of 0.98). The median sleep duration has also decreased by 32 minutes (Z-score delta of -0.8), and the median sleep start time has shifted later by over an hour (Z-score delta of 1.23).

Physiological data from wearable devices indicate a less regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability has decreased (delta of -0.17, Z-score delta of -1.22), suggesting a reduction in the day-to-day consistency of the heart rate pattern. Intradaily variability has increased (delta of 0.07, Z-score delta of 0.28), which, in conjunction with the decreased interdaily stability, may indicate a more fragmented or less structured daily physiological rhythm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has decreased (delta of -5.59, Z-score delta of -1.9), suggesting a reduced range between peak and trough heart rate activity. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm has shifted later, from 3:36 PM to 4:40 PM. While the mesor has slightly decreased, the overall picture from these circadian metrics points towards a less robust and potentially more disrupted daily physiological cycle. The hourly aggregated heart rate data also shows a notable increase in average heart rate during most waking hours in the current period compared to the previous one, particularly during peak activity times (e.g., 9-10 AM, 12-1 PM, 2-3 PM, 3-4 PM, 5-6 PM), which could reflect heightened physiological arousal. The resting heart rate, however, has remained relatively stable with a slight increase.

Behavioral changes also contribute to the picture of potentially increased stress. While exercise frequency has decreased for solo exercise (delta of -1.0, Z-score delta of -0.79), exercise with others remains consistent, and sports participation is unchanged. Notably, there is a significant increase in time spent listening to music (delta of 3.0 hours, Z-score delta of 1.57) and socializing with friends (delta of 2.0 hours, Z-score delta of 1.47). Daily recreation habits show an increase in watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage. Substance usage remains low and stable across all categories. The observed increase in passive recreational activities like watching TV and internet usage, alongside increases in music listening and social time, might be compensatory behaviors or reflect a shift in how the participant manages their time and potentially their stress. The decrease in solo exercise, coupled with an increase in passive activities, could suggest reduced engagement in stress-reducing physical activities.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of the perceived stress score (increase) is substantial. The significant increases in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), alongside a considerable decrease in self-esteem and health satisfaction, are strong indicators of increased psychological distress. The observed changes in sleep patterns, including reduced duration, decreased control, and a later sleep start time, are frequently associated with heightened stress. Furthermore, the physiological data suggests a less stable and potentially more disrupted circadian rhythm, with increased intraday variability and a later acrophase, indicating a deviation from established patterns that could be stress-related. The increased average hourly heart rates during waking hours also suggest a general state of higher physiological arousal.

Evidence for improvement or stability of the PSS score (decrease/stable) is limited. While the participant has increased engagement in social activities and music listening, and maintained their exercise with others, these positive behavioral shifts do not appear to fully counteract the negative trends in self-reported psychological states and physiological regulation. The correlation between changes in the CES-D and STAI scores with changes in PSS is positive, as indicated by the positive delta correlations (0.26 and 0.20 respectively), suggesting these increases in negative affect are aligned with potential increases in perceived stress. Conversely, the negative correlation between changes in self-esteem and PSS (-0.06) and trust (-0.06) with PSS changes suggests that decreases in these areas might be associated with increases in PSS. The initial PSS score correlation with change (-0.56) suggests that participants with higher initial PSS scores tend to experience decreases, implying that for this participant, whose initial PSS was near average (Z-score of -0.17), the tendency might be towards an increase.

Holistically, the combination of increased negative psychological indicators (depression, anxiety), decreased positive indicators (self-esteem, health satisfaction, trust), disrupted sleep, and altered physiological rhythms strongly suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress has worsened. The substantial increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are core components of perceived stress, are particularly compelling.

95559,1.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates several notable shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods. Self-reported measures indicate a significant decrease in depressive symptoms, with the CES-D score dropping by 6.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.53), moving from a previously moderate level to a lower one. Concurrently, trait anxiety (STAI) has decreased by 4.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.27), also suggesting a reduction in baseline anxiety proneness. In contrast, self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) has increased by 3.0 points (Z-score of delta: 0.58), indicating a growing sense of self-worth. Subjective happiness has also markedly improved, with a 2.0 point increase in the ""Happy"" score (Z-score of delta: 1.55), reaching a level significantly above the population mean. Health satisfaction has also seen a positive change, increasing by 1.33 points (Z-score of delta: 1.18), suggesting a greater perceived well-being.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports a substantial increase in their desired weekday sleep duration by 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta: 0.85), and their normal weekday sleep duration has also increased by 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta: 0.92). This is accompanied by a notable improvement in the feeling of control over sleep duration, indicated by a change from ""Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Agree"" (delta: 3.0, Z-score of delta: 1.58). Fitbit-derived sleep data corroborates this trend with a significant increase in median sleep duration by over an hour (delta: '1 hours 1 minutes', Z-score of delta: 1.06). However, the variability in sleep duration has decreased (delta: '-53 minutes', Z-score of delta: -1.18), suggesting more consistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time has shifted earlier by 26 minutes (delta: '0 hours 26 minutes', Z-score of delta: -0.53).

In terms of activity and physiological metrics, there has been a substantial increase in participation in ""Sports"" activities, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (delta: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.91). Conversely, reported internet usage has decreased from ""1-2 hours"" to ""31 minutes an hour"" (delta: -1.0, Z-score of delta: -0.79), and listening to music has ceased entirely (delta: -5.0, Z-score of delta: -2.64). Socializing with friends has increased (delta: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.75). Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 2.3 bpm (Z-score of delta: 0.53), moving towards the population mean. The interdaily stability of heart rate has improved (delta: 0.08, Z-score of delta: 0.63), suggesting a more structured daily rhythm, though intradaily variability has increased (delta: 0.26, Z-score of delta: 1.62). The mesor and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm have shown minor decreases, suggesting a slight reduction in the overall central tendency and range of heart rate variation.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is limited. While resting heart rate has increased and intradaily variability of heart rate has risen, these changes are not strongly correlated with perceived stress and could reflect increased physical activity or social engagement rather than stress.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is substantial. The most prominent indicator is the significant decrease in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), both of which are strongly associated with higher perceived stress. The marked increase in self-reported happiness and health satisfaction further supports a reduction in distress. The improvements in sleep quality and consistency, including increased duration and better control, are also key indicators of reduced stress. The shift towards more regular sleep patterns, as evidenced by improved interdaily stability in heart rate, and the increase in social interaction and sports participation, are generally associated with lower stress levels. The decrease in internet usage and cessation of music listening could indicate a redirection of time towards more active or social pursuits, potentially reducing stress. While the initial PSS score was within the average range (-0.44 Z-score), the concurrent positive changes in multiple psychological and behavioral domains strongly suggest a reduction in perceived stress.

Holistically analyzing the available evidence, the significant improvements in self-reported mood, anxiety, sleep, and engagement in positive activities, coupled with the generally stable or improved physiological markers related to rhythm and sleep, strongly indicate a decrease in the participant's overall perceived stress level.

The participant's self-reported measures indicate a modest increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D score increased by 1.0), which is not significant in its own right but warrants observation in conjunction with other factors. Conversely, trait anxiety (STAI) has shown a decrease of 4.0 points, moving from a more anxious to a less anxious baseline. Self-esteem has also slightly decreased by 1.0 point. Health satisfaction has declined by 0.44 points, moving towards a less satisfied state. In terms of substance usage, there has been a reduction in the frequency of wine or liquor consumption, moving from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" a change with a substantial negative Z-score of change (-1.25). Exercise habits show a decrease in exercising with others, moving from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all,"" a change with a negative Z-score of change (-0.43). Daily recreational habits reveal a significant decrease in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies, with a decrease of one category (from ""1-2 hours"" to ""31 minutes an hour""), reflected by a substantial negative Z-score of change (-0.82). There has also been a notable decrease in reported time spent on sedentary hobbies, moving from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""Do not do,"" characterized by a large negative Z-score of change (-1.68).

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate a shift in the timing of the circadian rhythm, with the acrophase occurring earlier in the day (from 4:51 PM to 2:50 PM). Interdaily stability, a measure of daily rhythm regularity, has slightly decreased, though the Z-score of change is negligible (-0.03). Conversely, intradaily variability has decreased significantly (Z-score of change of -2.06), suggesting a less fragmented daily pattern of heart rate. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has increased, indicating a stronger daily repetition in heart rate patterns, with a positive Z-score of change (1.2). The participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 2.8 beats per minute, which is a moderate decrease relative to the previous population average (Z-score of change of -0.55). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a substantial reduction in average heart rate during the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM), with the highest hourly averages observed in the morning and early afternoon. This differs from the previous period where higher hourly averages were observed in the late afternoon and evening. Sleep statistics show an increase in median sleep duration by 22 minutes, moving towards a more optimal range. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration has increased by 13 minutes, suggesting greater variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time has shifted significantly later by 54 minutes, indicated by a negative Z-score of change (-1.05). The standard deviation of sleep start time has also increased by 27 minutes, indicating less consistency in sleep onset.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was 23.0, which is slightly above the population mean (Z-score of 0.38). The correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS score over time is -0.56, suggesting that individuals with higher initial PSS scores tend to experience a decrease in stress over time. While not directly provided, the changes observed in several self-report measures and wearable metrics offer indirect insights into potential stress levels. The decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) and the reduction in wine/liquor consumption are indicative of potential stress reduction. Furthermore, the decrease in intradaily variability of heart rate and the earlier acrophase suggest a potential improvement in the regularity and structure of physiological rhythms, which can be associated with lower stress. The increase in median sleep duration and the shift towards earlier wake times (despite a later sleep start) could also be interpreted as a move towards improved sleep health, a common correlate of lower stress. However, the increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D), the decrease in health satisfaction, and the increased variability in sleep start times and duration indicate potential areas of concern that may be associated with elevated stress. The reduction in sedentary hobbies and TV/video watching, while generally positive, could also represent a shift in coping mechanisms that might be indirectly related to stress management or increase time spent on other potentially stressful activities.

Holistically, the data present a mixed picture. The reduction in anxiety and certain lifestyle changes (reduced alcohol, increased physical activity with others) are positive indicators for stress reduction. However, the slight increase in depressive symptoms, decrease in health satisfaction, and greater sleep variability suggest potential underlying stressors. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change suggests a tendency for higher initial stress to decrease. Considering the positive changes in anxiety and the potential for improved sleep patterns, alongside the mitigating factor of the initial PSS correlation, there is evidence to suggest a trend towards stress reduction or stability, despite some conflicting indicators.

The participant's self-reported CES-D score, which measures depressive symptoms, has significantly decreased by 5 points, moving from a score of 10.0 to 5.0. This change is accompanied by a negative Z-score of delta (-0.42), indicating a reduction in depressive symptoms relative to the study population. The STAI-Trait anxiety scores remained stable with no change, and the participant's self-esteem also showed a minimal decrease of 1.0 point, with a non-significant change in Z-score. Their self-reported happiness also remained unchanged. In terms of health satisfaction, there was a moderate increase in the score, from 2.67 to 3.11, reflecting a more positive outlook on their physical health, though still below the population average as indicated by the Z-score delta of 0.36. Sleep latency has remained stable at 10.0 minutes, but the ideal weekday sleep duration has decreased by 1.0 hour, alongside a slight reduction in the perceived control over sleep duration. Notably, the actual normal weekday sleep duration has not changed. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, has remained consistent between the two measurement periods, with no changes in frequency or quantity. Engagement in physical activity has seen a substantial decrease, particularly in sports, where the frequency dropped from 1-2 times a week to less than 1-2 times a month. This corresponds to a significant negative change in the frequency number of -2.0, and a negative Z-score of delta of -1.16. Other forms of exercise also remain at 'Not at all' frequency. Leisure activities show an increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies by 1 hour and a slight increase in sedentary hobby time by 1 hour.

Physiological data from the wearable indicates a decrease in the participant's resting heart rate by 2.7 beats per minute, resulting in a more favorable Z-score of delta (-0.53), suggesting an improved resting cardiovascular state relative to the population. The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, also decreased, but this was a modest change. The amplitude, representing the range of heart rate variation, remained largely stable. Circadian rhythm metrics show an increase in interdaily stability (0.05 delta, Z-score of 0.41) and a slight increase in intradaily variability (0.05 delta, Z-score of 0.13), suggesting a marginally more structured daily heart rate pattern. The autocorrelation at 24 hours, a measure of rhythmicity, showed a substantial increase (0.23 delta, Z-score of 1.47), indicating a stronger daily periodicity in heart rate. The median sleep duration has slightly increased by 2 minutes, with a corresponding decrease in sleep duration standard deviation, suggesting more consistent sleep length. Sleep start times have also slightly shifted later by 5 minutes, with a stable standard deviation.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is minimal. While there was a decrease in the ideal weekday sleep duration and a slight reduction in the feeling of control over sleep, and a significant decrease in sports engagement, these do not directly or strongly correlate with increased stress as per the provided correlation data. The decrease in sports engagement has a low positive correlation (0.0) with changes in PSS.

Conversely, several indicators suggest a potential improvement or stability in perceived stress. The significant reduction in CES-D scores points towards a decrease in depressive symptoms. The stable anxiety scores and minimal change in self-esteem also do not indicate heightened stress. The improvement in health satisfaction and the decrease in resting heart rate are positive physiological indicators that could be associated with reduced stress. Furthermore, the increase in interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours in heart rate data suggests a more regular daily rhythm, which can be indicative of better stress management. The minor increase in actual sleep duration and decreased variability also contribute to a more stable sleep pattern. The initial PSS score was -1.53 standard deviations below the mean, and its correlation with change was -0.56, suggesting that initial lower stress levels were associated with a greater tendency for stress to decrease.

Holistically, the substantial decrease in depressive symptoms, stable anxiety, and positive physiological changes such as a lower resting heart rate and improved circadian rhythm regularity outweigh the minor negative shifts in sleep habits and exercise. These factors collectively suggest a trend towards improved well-being and reduced perceived stress.

79834,3.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several notable changes in self-reported psychological and behavioral metrics between the two measurement periods, with some potentially influencing perceived stress. A significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D scale, is observed, with a score decrease of 2.0. Concurrently, trait anxiety, measured by the STAI, also decreased by 4.0, suggesting a general reduction in proneness to anxiety. Self-esteem has notably increased by 5.0 points, a substantial gain that could contribute to a more positive psychological outlook. In contrast, interpersonal trust has declined by 0.5 points, reaching a Z-score of -2.41, indicating a significantly lower level of trust compared to the study population. Regarding sleep habits, the participant reports an increase in sleep latency by 5.0 minutes, while their normal weekday sleep duration has decreased by 1.0 hour, and their ideal sleep duration has also decreased by 1.0 hour. This indicates a potential worsening of sleep quality and perceived control over sleep, despite an increase in the feeling of control over sleep duration by 3.0 points. In terms of daily activities, there has been a considerable increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, rising from 16-30 minutes to 1-2 hours, and a substantial increase in listening to music, from 15 minutes or less to 3-4 hours. Substance usage for wine or liquor remains consistent, and other reported substance usage categories remain at ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency across all categories remains unchanged.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a decrease in their average resting heart rate by 4.05 bpm, falling to 55.6 bpm, which is below the population average. This is accompanied by a reduction in the Mesor (mean heart rate) of the circadian rhythm by 4.29 bpm and a decrease in the amplitude of the circadian rhythm by 1.78. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, has shifted earlier by approximately 1.5 hours, now occurring around 4:20 PM. Wearable-derived metrics for circadian rhythm regularity show a slight decrease in interdaily stability and an increase in intradaily variability. Specifically, intradaily variability has increased by 0.4, reaching a Z-score of 2.02, suggesting a less consistent heart rate pattern throughout the day. Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a decrease in median sleep duration by 44 minutes, falling below the population average, and a significant reduction in the standard deviation of sleep duration by 53 minutes, suggesting more consistent, shorter sleep. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 14 minutes.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a potential increase in perceived stress is suggested by the observed increase in intradaily heart rate variability, indicating a less stable physiological state. Furthermore, the reported decrease in normal weekday sleep duration and a later median sleep start time, coupled with a shorter average sleep duration, could contribute to heightened stress. The decline in interpersonal trust is a significant indicator of potential social or relational stressors that might be impacting the participant's overall well-being.

Conversely, several factors suggest a potential improvement or stability in perceived stress. The significant decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. The substantial increase in self-esteem also points towards a more resilient and positive psychological state. The decrease in resting heart rate and the reduction in the Mesor and amplitude of the circadian rhythm could reflect improved physiological regulation, often associated with lower stress. While the increase in TV/video watching and music listening is notable, their correlation with changes in PSS is weakly negative or close to zero, suggesting they are not strong drivers of stress changes in this data. The correlations provided for many of the individual changes, particularly those with modest or negligible changes (e.g., GPA, substance usage, exercise, most daily recreation habits except TV/videos and music), suggest they are unlikely to be major contributors to shifts in perceived stress. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and its change (-0.56) suggests that individuals with initially higher PSS scores tended to experience greater reductions in stress, implying a tendency towards improvement for those who started with higher stress levels. While this participant's initial PSS score was below average, the presence of this general trend is worth noting.

Considering the strong evidence of reduced psychological distress (lower depression and anxiety, higher self-esteem) and physiological improvements (lower resting heart rate, more stable circadian rhythm parameters, though with increased intradaily variability), alongside the generally weak correlations of most behavioral changes with PSS, the indicators for stress improvement or stability appear more robust than those for worsening. The decrease in sleep duration, while concerning, is offset by the positive changes in mental health indicators.

This participant exhibits several notable shifts in their psychological and behavioral metrics between the two assessment periods. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, have significantly decreased (Delta Z-score of -1.08), moving from a state of moderate symptom burden to one indicative of minimal depressive affect. Conversely, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, has shown a moderate increase (Delta Z-score of 0.63), transitioning from a ""not anxious"" classification to ""anxious."" Self-esteem has slightly declined (Delta Z-score of -0.35), though this change is not substantial enough to alter its classification. Notably, self-reported happiness has substantially increased (Delta Z-score of 1.55), moving from a below-average score to a significantly above-average level. Health satisfaction has decreased (Delta Z-score of -0.87), shifting from a moderate level of satisfaction to a lower one.

Behavioral patterns reveal a reduction in exercise with others (Delta Z-score of -1.86) and a subsequent increase in sports participation (Delta Num delta of 0.0, though Z-score of delta is 0.22 indicating relative stability in frequency). There has been a decrease in daily internet usage time (Delta Num delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.79) and listening to music (Delta Num delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.54), alongside an increase in watching TV/videos/movies (Delta Num delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.46) and reading (Delta Num delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.6). Substance usage remains stable with no reported change in beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs.

From a physiological perspective, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 3.7 bpm (Delta Z-score of 0.82). The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a decrease in interdaily stability (Delta Z-score of -1.59) and intradaily variability (Delta Z-score of -1.5), suggesting a less regular daily rhythm in heart rate. The acrophase has shifted approximately 32 minutes later, from 4:51 PM to 5:23 PM. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, has increased (Delta Z-score of 0.76), while the amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation, has decreased (Delta Z-score of -1.02). Sleep statistics show a positive increase in median sleep duration by 51 minutes (Delta Z-score of 0.85), with a slight decrease in the standard deviation of sleep duration. The median sleep start time has shifted later by approximately 15 minutes (Delta Z-score of 0.26), and the standard deviation of sleep start time has decreased, indicating more consistent sleep timing.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress is suggested by the increase in trait anxiety (STAI, Delta Z-score 0.63) and a decrease in health satisfaction (Delta Z-score -0.87). The increase in resting heart rate and the decrease in interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate also suggest a potential increase in physiological stress reactivity.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is indicated by the significant decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D, Delta Z-score -1.08), a substantial increase in self-reported happiness (Delta Z-score 1.55), and an increase in overall sleep duration. The reduction in internet usage and increase in reading are positive behavioral changes.

Holistically analyzing the provided data, the substantial decrease in depressive symptoms and significant increase in happiness, alongside improvements in sleep duration, point towards a positive shift in the participant's overall psychological well-being. While some indicators like increased trait anxiety and reduced health satisfaction warrant attention, they are counterbalanced by the more pronounced improvements in mood and depression. The physiological changes, particularly increased resting heart rate and decreased circadian rhythm regularity, may be related to the transition into a more anxious state, but the positive changes in subjective well-being suggest a net improvement in perceived stress. Therefore, the overall direction of change in perceived stress appears to be towards improvement.

Conversely, self-esteem has decreased by 4.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.72), suggesting a potential decline in self-worth. Trust levels have seen a slight increase of 0.17 points (Z-score of delta: 0.31), and health satisfaction has marginally decreased by 0.11 points (Z-score of delta: -0.15). Happiness remains stable with a delta of 0.0.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant has increased their consumption of 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' by a significant margin (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.46), while decreasing 'Video Games' (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-score of delta: -0.81) and 'Internet Usage' (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-score of delta: -0.79). 'Reading' habits have also increased (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.6), moving from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less."" Alcohol and recreational drug usage remain unchanged. Exercise habits are stable, with no change in frequency for exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports.

Physiological data from wearable devices present notable shifts. Interdaily Stability (Delta: 0.21, Z-score of delta: 1.59) and Intradaily Variability (Delta: 0.13, Z-score of delta: 0.70) of heart rate, as well as Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Delta: 0.28, Z-score of delta: 1.81), have all increased, suggesting a more structured and potentially more robust circadian rhythm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has also increased (Delta: 3.58, Z-score of delta: 1.21), while the Mesor has decreased (Delta: -4.09, Z-score of delta: -0.66). Resting heart rate has slightly decreased by 1.8 beats per minute (Delta: -1.8, Z-score of delta: -0.34).

Sleep metrics indicate a modest increase in median sleep duration (Delta: '0 hours 19 minutes', Z-score of delta: 0.22) and a notable decrease in sleep duration variability (Delta: '-23 minutes', Z-score of delta: -0.45), implying more consistent sleep lengths. The median sleep start time has shifted later by approximately 11 minutes (Delta: '0 hours 11 minutes', Z-score of delta: 0.18), accompanied by a significant reduction in the variability of sleep start times (Delta: '-32 minutes', Z-score of delta: -0.61), indicating more regular sleep onset.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress can be inferred from the self-reported increases in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI-Trait), as well as the decrease in self-esteem. These psychological indicators are often associated with higher perceived stress.

Conversely, evidence for stability or improvement in perceived stress is less direct but can be linked to several factors. The increased interdaily stability, intradaily variability, and autocorrelation of heart rate, along with increased circadian rhythm amplitude, suggest a more regular and potentially healthier physiological rhythm, which can buffer against stress. The decrease in resting heart rate, while small, also suggests improved physiological regulation. Furthermore, the increased consistency in sleep duration and sleep start times, despite a slight delay in onset, points towards more stable sleep patterns, which are crucial for stress management. The observed increase in reading and a decrease in sedentary activities like video games and extensive internet usage could also be indicative of adaptive coping mechanisms.

Considering the combined evidence, the increases in negative psychological indicators (depression, anxiety, lower self-esteem) are significant. While improvements in physiological regularity and sleep consistency offer a counterbalancing perspective, they may not fully negate the impact of the reported psychological distress. The correlations provided with the changes in PSS score also indicate moderate negative associations with changes in SelfEsteem (-0.05), and negative associations with changes in `Internet Usage` (-0.10), `Reading` (-0.12), `Socializing with Friends` (-0.08), and `Median Sleep Start Time` (-0.18). The increase in CES-D (0.25) and STAI (0.19) are also notable. Given the prominence of increased depressive symptoms and anxiety, and the decline in self-esteem, the overall perceived stress score is likely to have worsened.

Concurrently, the STAI Trait Anxiety score has escalated substantially, with an 8.0-point increase from a previous Z-score of 1.55 to a current Z-score of 2.59. These changes suggest a pronounced elevation in both mood and anxiety-related symptomatology. In contrast, self-esteem has shown a modest decrease of 2.0 points, moving from a Z-score of -0.87 to -1.13, which, while not as substantial as the increases in depression and anxiety, aligns with the overall trend of heightened psychological distress. Health satisfaction has also declined by -0.89 points, shifting from a positive Z-score of 0.38 to a negative Z-score of -0.32, indicating a reduced perception of overall physical health.

Lifestyle behaviors show some shifts, with a decrease in the time spent on internet usage, moving from a Z-score of -0.49 to -1.34. Conversely, the time spent reading has increased, moving from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less,"" with a positive Z-score delta of 0.6. Exercise habits remain largely stable, with minor fluctuations in participation. The participant's substance usage patterns, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, have remained constant.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports a decrease in sleep latency by 5.0 minutes, moving from 45.0 minutes to 40.0 minutes, with a negative Z-score delta of -0.46. This could suggest an easier time falling asleep. The desired weekday sleep duration has increased by 0.5 hours, from 8.0 to 8.5 hours, indicating a greater perceived need for sleep. Objective sleep duration, as measured by the Fitbit, shows an increase of 24 minutes, from 7 hours 24 minutes to 7 hours 48 minutes, with a positive Z-score delta of 0.32. However, the median sleep start time has shifted earlier by approximately 1 hour, from 00:21:40 to 23:20:23, with a significant negative Z-score delta of -1.19, suggesting a disruption in the regularity of sleep onset.

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data reveal some concerning patterns. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased by 1.6, moving from a Z-score of 0.63 to 1.35, indicating a greater fluctuation in heart rate over a 24-hour period. While the resting heart rate has slightly decreased by 0.3 bpm, the overall pattern of hourly heart rate data suggests periods of elevated heart rate during the afternoon, particularly between 3 PM and 6 PM, with peaks reaching over 100 bpm. This is more pronounced in the current data compared to the previous measurement period, especially during the 4-5 PM hour. The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted slightly later to 3:36 PM from 3:02 PM. Intradaily variability in heart rate has remained stable at 0.45, but interdaily stability has slightly decreased by 0.02, indicating a minor reduction in the consistency of daily rhythmicity.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is strong and multi-faceted. The most significant indicators are the substantial increases in both CES-D (depressive symptoms) and STAI (anxiety) scores. These elevated scores, well above population means, suggest a significant increase in psychological distress. The decrease in health satisfaction further supports this interpretation, indicating a reduced overall well-being. The earlier sleep onset, despite a longer overall sleep duration, accompanied by a later acrophase and increased amplitude in heart rate variability, may point towards a disrupted circadian rhythm and potentially poorer sleep quality, which are often associated with heightened stress. The increase in amplitude and peaks in afternoon heart rate also suggest a physiological response indicative of stress or heightened arousal.

Conversely, there is minimal evidence to support an improvement or stability in perceived stress. While sleep latency has decreased and overall sleep duration has increased, these objective improvements in sleep parameters are overshadowed by the subjective and physiological markers of distress. Self-esteem has slightly decreased, and there are no significant positive behavioral changes that would counteract the negative psychological trends. The correlations between changes in various metrics and changes in PSS are mixed, but the strong increases in depression and anxiety symptoms are the most potent indicators of worsening stress.

Considering the significant and concurrent increases in measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with a decline in health satisfaction, the overall perceived stress for this participant has demonstrably worsened.

23576,-5.0,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several notable shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods, with implications for perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D delta of -2.0, Z-score of -0.09) and a reduction in trait anxiety (STAI delta of -3.0, Z-score of -0.14). Concurrently, self-esteem has declined (SelfEsteem delta of -5.0, Z-score of -0.9), and perceived happiness has significantly increased (Happy delta of 2.0, Z-score of 1.55). Health satisfaction shows a modest increase (Health Satisfaction delta of 0.44, Z-score of 0.36).

Regarding sleep habits, the participant reports a decrease in the time taken to fall asleep (Sleep Latency delta of -15 minutes, Z-score of -1.06) and a reduction in the feeling of control over sleep duration (Control delta of -1.0, Z-score of -0.8). There has been a decrease in the reported normal weekday sleep duration (Normal Weekday Sleep Duration delta of -1.0 hours, Z-score of -1.11), and a slight decrease in the ideal sleep duration (Ideal Weekday Sleep Time delta of -0.5 hours, Z-score of -0.32).

In terms of physical activity, the frequency of exercising with others has increased (Exercised with Others delta of 1.0, Z-score of 1.0), while sports participation has decreased (Sports delta of -1.0, Z-score of -0.47). Daily recreational habits show an increase in time spent on video games (Video Games delta of 1.0, Z-score of 0.64) and internet usage (Internet Usage delta of 1.0, Z-score of 0.55), with a decrease in listening to music and socializing with friends. A notable increase in sedentary hobby time is observed (Sedentary Hobby delta of 3.0, Z-score of 1.41).

Physiological data from wearables indicate a decrease in overall sleep duration stability (Interdaily Stability delta of -0.04, Z-score of -0.26) and a significant reduction in intradaily variability of heart rate (Intradaily Variability delta of -0.19, Z-score of -1.57), suggesting a more regular, less variable heart rate pattern throughout the day. The resting heart rate has decreased slightly (Resting Heart Rate delta of -1.9, Z-score of -0.36). The MESOR (mean of circadian rhythm) has slightly decreased (Mesor delta of -0.29, Z-score of 0.17), while the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased (Amplitude delta of 1.36, Z-score of 0.46). The acrophase has shifted slightly later by approximately 20 minutes.

### Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Analysis of the provided data indicates a mixed pattern of changes, making a definitive conclusion about the overall direction of perceived stress complex.

Evidence for a potential worsening of perceived stress (increase in PSS) can be inferred from several behavioral shifts. The increase in time spent on sedentary hobbies and the decrease in social interaction with friends may contribute to higher stress levels. Additionally, the reduction in reported normal weekday sleep duration and the decreased feeling of control over sleep could also be indicative of increased stress. The observed decrease in intradaily heart rate variability, despite a lower resting heart rate, suggests a flattening of the natural circadian rhythm, which can sometimes be associated with higher stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress (decrease or stable PSS) is also present. The significant increase in self-reported happiness and the decrease in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are strong indicators of improved psychological well-being. The reduction in sleep latency also suggests an improvement in sleep onset. The increase in exercise frequency with others, while sports participation decreased, points to continued engagement in physical activity, which is generally stress-reducing. The modest increase in health satisfaction further supports a more positive overall state. The initial PSS score was near the population average (Z-score of -0.17), and its correlation with the change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that individuals starting with a moderate stress level may experience a decrease over time.

Holistically, the reduction in negative affect (depressive symptoms, anxiety) and the increase in positive affect (happiness) appear to be more robust indicators of psychological well-being than the mixed behavioral and physiological changes. While certain behavioral habits have shifted towards more sedentary activities and reduced social engagement, the overall trend in self-reported mood and anxiety suggests a potential for stress reduction. The decrease in sleep latency and improved perceived health satisfaction also lean towards an improvement. Therefore, despite some concerning behavioral and physiological shifts, the significant improvements in self-reported psychological states suggest that the participant's overall perceived stress has likely remained stable or decreased.

The participant exhibits a notable decrease in self-reported depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D score, which declined by 11 points, representing a significant Z-score of -1.08 for the change. Concurrently, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, has also decreased by 8 points (Z-score of delta: -0.78), shifting from a classification of ""anxious"" to ""not anxious."" Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, has shown a modest increase of 3 points (Z-score of delta: 0.58), reaching the maximum score of 40. These psychological improvements are accompanied by a substantial increase in self-reported happiness, with a gain of 2 points (Z-score of delta: 1.55), which is a particularly strong positive change. Trust in others has slightly decreased by 0.33 (Z-score of delta: -0.93), though this change is less pronounced in magnitude compared to the improvements in depressive symptoms and anxiety.

In terms of sleep habits, the participant reports a reduction in sleep latency by 5 minutes (Z-score of delta: -0.46), suggesting an improvement in the time taken to fall asleep. However, the normal weekday sleep duration has decreased by 1 hour (Z-score of delta: -1.11), falling below the average for the study population. This is further supported by a decrease in the feeling of control over sleep duration, shifting from ""Somewhat Agree"" to ""Somewhat Disagree"" (Z-score of delta: -1.4), indicating a subjective decline in perceived sleep regulation. Objective sleep data from wearables show a slight increase in median sleep duration by 14 minutes, which is not statistically significant. Conversely, the standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased by 27 minutes (Z-score of delta: -0.56), suggesting more consistent sleep duration, while the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased by 25 minutes (Z-score of delta: 0.54), indicating less regularity in bedtime.

Behaviorally, substance usage has increased, with the participant reporting drinking beer 1-2 times a month, a change from ""Not at all"" previously, with a notable positive Z-score of 1.66 for the numerical change. Exercise habits show a decrease in frequency of exercising with others by one instance per month (Z-score of delta: -0.43) and sports participation by one instance per month (Z-score of delta: -0.47). Daily recreation habits reveal a significant reduction in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, decreasing by 3 numerical instances (Z-score of delta: -2.1), and a reduction in internet usage by one unit of time (Z-score of delta: -0.79). Conversely, there has been an increase in time spent listening to music by one increment (Z-score of delta: 0.52) and socializing with friends by one increment of time (Z-score of delta: 0.75). Sedentary hobby time has decreased by 3 numerical instances (Z-score of delta: -1.68).

Physiologically, the participant's interdaily stability of heart rate has decreased by 0.14 (Z-score of delta: -0.99), indicating a reduction in the regularity of daily activity patterns. Intradaily variability has also decreased by 0.17 (Z-score of delta: -1.43), suggesting a flattening of the daily heart rate fluctuations. The acrophase has shifted earlier by approximately 1 hour and 18 minutes, from 3:34 PM to 2:16 PM. The MESOR, a measure of the central tendency of the circadian rhythm, has slightly decreased by 2.01 (Z-score of delta: -0.21), indicating a lower average heart rate throughout the day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased by 1.4 (Z-score of delta: 0.47), suggesting a wider daily fluctuation in heart rate. The resting heart rate has decreased by 3.2 beats per minute (Z-score of delta: -0.64). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a general decrease in heart rate across most hours, particularly during late night and early morning, with notable reductions in the 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, and 2-3 AM periods. However, the peak hourly heart rates during the late morning and afternoon remain elevated.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress (increase) is suggested by the decreased self-reported control over sleep duration and the increase in beer consumption. The reduction in interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate, alongside a slight decrease in the MESOR and an increase in amplitude, may indicate less structured physiological rhythms. Conversely, substantial evidence points towards an improvement or stability in the participant's perceived stress. The marked reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), coupled with an increase in self-esteem and a significant rise in happiness, are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. While normal weekday sleep duration has decreased, median sleep duration has slightly increased, and sleep duration variability has reduced, suggesting potentially more consistent, albeit shorter, sleep. Behaviorally, there has been a significant decrease in passive activities like watching TV and internet usage, offset by increases in more engaging activities such as listening to music and socializing with friends. The decrease in resting heart rate is also a positive physiological indicator. Considering the significant improvements in key psychological well-being measures (depression, anxiety, happiness) and the mixed but not overwhelmingly negative physiological and behavioral changes, the overall trend appears to be towards reduced perceived stress.

69057,-10.0,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to understand changes in a university student population over a two-year period, with a specific focus on perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

The participant's initial PSS score was 26.0, which is 1.19 standard deviations above the mean. This initial score has a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) with the change in PSS over time, suggesting that higher initial stress levels might be associated with a subsequent decrease in stress.

Several self-reported psychological measures indicate a trend towards improved psychological well-being. The CES-D score, a measure of depressive symptoms, decreased by 5.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.42), moving from the 88th percentile to the 46th percentile relative to the study population. While the participant is still classified as ""Not depressed,"" this reduction suggests a decrease in reported depressive symptoms. Similarly, trait anxiety as measured by the STAI decreased by 4.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.27), although the participant remains within the ""anxious"" classification range. Self-esteem exhibited a notable increase, with the score rising by 8.0 points (Z-score of delta: -1.46), shifting the participant from a lower percentile (below average) to a significantly higher percentile (well above average) on this measure. Interpersonal trust also saw a decrease of 0.5 points (Z-score of delta: -1.34), moving the participant to a significantly lower percentile, suggesting a decline in reported trust. Self-reported happiness increased by 1.0 point (Z-score of delta: 0.71), moving the participant to the 77th percentile. Health satisfaction also improved, with a score increase of 0.56 points (Z-score of delta: 0.46), placing the participant slightly above the population average.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant's alcohol consumption has increased, with both beer and wine/liquor usage shifting from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (numerical delta of 1.0 for both, Z-scores of delta: 0.70 and 0.73, respectively). Recreational drug usage also increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (numerical delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta: 1.97), a substantial increase that places them in a very high percentile for this behavior. Exercise habits show a mixed pattern. While exercising alone remained consistent, the frequency of exercising with others decreased significantly, shifting from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (numerical delta of -2.0, Z-score of delta: -1.15). Daily recreation shows an increase in video game usage, moving from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (numerical delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.64). Internet usage time decreased, moving from ""31 minutes to an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes"" (numerical delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta: -0.79).

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics and sleep statistics present a complex picture. Interdaily stability, a measure of daily rhythm regularity, slightly decreased (delta: -0.03, Z-score of delta: -0.18), while intraday variability slightly increased (delta: 0.04, Z-score of delta: 0.06). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, shifted significantly earlier in the day, from 6:18 PM to 2:24 PM. The Mesor, an indicator of average daily heart rate, decreased by 0.73 (Z-score of delta: 0.07), placing the participant below the population average. The amplitude, reflecting the range of daily heart rate variation, also decreased by 2.43 (Z-score of delta: -0.83), indicating a less pronounced diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. Resting heart rate slightly increased by 0.7 beats per minute (Z-score of delta: 0.19), though it remains notably low compared to the population average. Median sleep duration increased by 33 minutes (Z-score of delta: 0.50), improving the participant's position relative to the population mean. Conversely, sleep start time shifted significantly later by 41 minutes (Z-score of delta: -0.82).

The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals notable shifts between the two time periods. A decrease in average heart rate is observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM). However, a pronounced increase in average heart rate is evident during the morning hours, particularly between 7-8 AM and 8-9 AM, which are significantly higher than the previous period. Evening hours also show an increase in average heart rate, with notable peaks between 5-6 PM and 7-8 PM. The Mesor and Amplitude changes, along with the acrophase shift, suggest a disruption in the typical diurnal heart rate pattern, with a lower overall average (Mesor) and reduced fluctuation (Amplitude), coupled with an earlier peak.

Overall, while there are indications of improved psychological well-being, particularly in self-esteem and reduced depressive symptoms, there are also concerning behavioral changes. The increase in alcohol and recreational drug use, coupled with a decrease in social exercise and a significant shift in sleep timing, warrants attention. The changes in heart rate patterns, including the earlier acrophase and increased morning and evening heart rates, might reflect altered physiological responses to daily demands or stress. The decrease in interpersonal trust is a significant concern that warrants further investigation in the context of overall stress. Considering the mixed indicators, the net effect on perceived stress is not definitively clear, but the increase in substance use and the observed physiological changes suggest a potential for increased stress despite some positive self-report trends.

The participant's self-reported data reveals some notable shifts between the two data collection periods. While the CES-D score remained within the ""Not depressed"" classification and showed a slight decrease, indicating a minor reduction in depressive symptoms, the STAI Trait anxiety score also saw a minimal decrease, remaining within the ""anxious"" classification. Self-esteem experienced a modest increase, moving from 37.0 to 39.0, though it did not reach a clinically significant level of change. Notably, the participant reported a significant increase in their desired sleep duration, aiming for 9.0 hours compared to the previous 8.0 hours, with a concurrent increase in their perceived normal weekday sleep duration from 6.5 to 8.0 hours. This suggests an increased awareness or need for longer sleep. The feeling of control over sleep duration also improved, shifting from ""Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Disagree."" In terms of behavioral habits, there was a marked decrease in the frequency of beer consumption, moving from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month."" Exercise habits showed an increase in frequency for exercising with others and remained stable for exercising alone and participating in sports. Daily recreation habits indicate a substantial increase in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" shifting from ""Do not do"" to ""31 minutes an hour."" Conversely, there was a decrease in ""Internet Usage"" time. Socializing with friends also increased in duration.

The wearable-derived physiological data present a mixed picture. The participant's resting heart rate increased by 3.5 bpm, moving from 56.0 to 59.5, placing it slightly above the population average. The MESOR, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, also decreased slightly, suggesting a potential reduction in baseline cardiovascular activity. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm significantly decreased, indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability, measures of overall rhythm regularity, both decreased, suggesting a less structured or more variable daily pattern in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, shifted slightly later in the evening. Sleep duration exhibited a notable increase in median duration by 55 minutes, which aligns with self-reported desires, and a substantial decrease in the standard deviation of sleep duration, indicating more consistent sleep timing. The standard deviation of sleep start time also decreased significantly, further supporting improved sleep regularity.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The data presents a complex interplay of factors that may influence perceived stress. On one hand, there are indicators of potential improvement in well-being. The decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D), minimal decrease in trait anxiety (STAI), and an increase in self-esteem, alongside self-reported increases in desired and normal sleep duration and a greater feeling of control over sleep, suggest a more positive psychological state. Furthermore, a reduction in beer consumption and increased social interaction and exercise with others could also contribute to reduced stress. The improved consistency in sleep duration and timing, as indicated by the wearable data, is also a positive sign.

However, there are also concerning physiological and behavioral shifts. The increase in resting heart rate, while still within a normal range, may indicate a sustained physiological arousal. The decreased amplitude and stability of the circadian rhythm from wearable data could reflect a less regulated daily pattern, which can be associated with increased stress. The significant increase in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and decrease in ""Internet Usage"" suggest a shift in daily activities, the implications of which for stress are not entirely clear without further context, but a large increase in sedentary screen time could be a negative indicator.

The initial PSS score was 27.0, which is above the average (Z-Score of 1.47), indicating a higher baseline level of perceived stress. The negative correlation (-0.56) between the initial PSS score and its change suggests that individuals with higher initial PSS scores tended to experience a decrease in PSS over time. Given that the participant started with a relatively high PSS score, this correlation would predict a potential decrease. While many indicators point towards positive changes in aspects of well-being and sleep, the physiological changes in circadian rhythm stability and the increase in resting heart rate, coupled with the high initial PSS score, warrant careful consideration. However, the clear improvements in sleep metrics (both subjective and objective regularity) and the decrease in substance use, along with stable or slightly improved mood indicators, suggest a leaning towards a reduction in perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported psychological state exhibits some fluctuations, though not uniformly indicative of increased stress. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, remained stable with a score delta of 0.0, indicating no change in the frequency of reported depressive symptoms. Similarly, self-reported happiness scores also remained unchanged. Trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, saw a slight increase of 2.0 points, moving the score from 35.0 to 37.0, though remaining within the ""not anxious"" classification. Self-esteem showed a minor increase of 2.0 points, from 38.0 to 40.0, reaching the maximum possible score. Health satisfaction, however, experienced a notable decrease of -1.67 points, falling from 4.44 to 2.78, a change with a significant Z-score of -1.59. Trust scores increased marginally from 3.0 to 3.17.

Behavioral habits also present a mixed picture. The participant has significantly reduced their alcohol consumption, moving from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" and has ceased beer consumption entirely, which was previously ""1-2 times a month."" Exercise frequency has decreased, with ""Exercised Alone"" dropping from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""1-2 times a week."" Notably, there was a substantial decrease in ""Socializing with Friends,"" from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""Do not do."" Other daily recreational habits such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, internet usage, listening to music, and engaging in sedentary hobbies remained largely stable in terms of time allocation. Sleep duration, both in terms of ideal desired time and normal weekday duration, has seen an increase by 2.0 and 1.0 hours respectively. However, sleep latency increased by 5.0 minutes. The feeling of control over sleep duration remained ""Somewhat Disagree.""

Physiological metrics derived from the wearable data indicate a shift towards a more regular and potentially less stressed physiological state. Interdaily stability of heart rate has slightly decreased, as has autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggesting a minor reduction in the strict adherence to a 24-hour rhythm. Conversely, intradaily variability has significantly decreased, indicating a less erratic pattern of heart rate fluctuations throughout the day. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, has decreased by 4.18 bpm, falling from 74.51 to 70.33, and is now below the population average. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased, suggesting a greater peak-to-trough variation in heart rate. The acrophase has shifted earlier in the day, from 7:04 PM to 4:08 PM. Resting heart rate has decreased by 6.2 bpm. Sleep statistics reveal a significant increase in sleep duration variability, with a substantial rise in both median sleep duration and its standard deviation. Sleep start times have become more consistent, with the median start time shifting earlier and its standard deviation increasing substantially.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The analysis of the available data suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing the participant's perceived stress. While there are indicators of potential strain, such as a significant decrease in health satisfaction and a decrease in social interaction, other factors point towards a more stable or potentially improved state. The absence of change in depressive symptoms and happiness, coupled with a slight increase in self-esteem and trust, suggests a stable psychological baseline in some domains. The reduction in alcohol consumption and the increase in desired and actual sleep duration could contribute to stress reduction.

However, the substantial increase in sleep duration variability and the significant rise in sleep start time standard deviation, coupled with an increase in sleep latency, might suggest disruptions in sleep architecture that could indirectly impact stress levels. The observed decrease in resting heart rate and mesor, along with the reduction in intradaily variability, generally points towards a less aroused physiological state, which is often associated with lower stress. The shift in acrophase earlier in the day may reflect changes in daily routines or chronotype. The decrease in health satisfaction is a notable concern, and while its direct correlation with PSS change is low, it warrants attention.

Considering the mixed indicators, particularly the stable or slightly improved psychological markers, reduced substance use, and physiological indicators of lower arousal, the overall perceived stress is likely to have remained stable or decreased, despite some behavioral and sleep pattern changes that warrant further investigation. The correlation of the initial PSS score with changes in PSS is -0.56, indicating that higher initial PSS scores are associated with a decrease in PSS over time, suggesting a tendency towards stress reduction in this participant pool.

The participant exhibits notable shifts in psychological well-being and behavioral patterns between the two measurement periods. A significant improvement is observed in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a substantial decrease in the CES-D score (delta of -11.0, Z-score of delta -1.08). Similarly, anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, have decreased considerably (delta of -10.0, Z-score of delta -1.04), moving the participant from an ""anxious"" to a ""not anxious"" classification. Self-esteem has shown a modest increase (delta of 4.0, Z-score of delta 0.76), aligning with these positive psychological changes. While happiness scores have declined slightly (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.96), this is counterbalanced by an increase in health satisfaction (delta of 0.78, Z-score of delta 0.67). Interpersonal trust has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase (delta of 0.17, Z-score of delta 0.31).

Behavioral changes are also evident. Alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor) has increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.73). Exercise frequency has increased, particularly ""Exercised Alone"" (delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.91) and ""Sports"" (delta of 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.91), though the overall frequency of exercising with others has remained stable. There have been notable reductions in time spent on certain recreational activities. Specifically, ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" has decreased from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.82), and ""Internet Usage"" has decreased from ""2-3 hours"" to ""1-2 hours"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.79). ""Listening to Music"" has also significantly reduced from ""1-2 hours"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (delta of -3.0, Z-score of delta -1.59). Socializing with friends has also seen a decrease in reported time from ""2-3 hours"" to ""1-2 hours"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.68).

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a significant increase in the participant's Mesor (mean heart rate over a 24-hour period) by 8.19 bpm (Z-score of delta 2.02), indicating an overall higher baseline heart rate. The resting heart rate has also increased by 5.1 bpm (Z-score of delta 1.12). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has increased by 2.55 bpm (Z-score of delta 0.86). Conversely, sleep duration variability has decreased, with the standard deviation of sleep duration reducing by 81 minutes (Z-score of delta -1.84), suggesting more consistent sleep durations. The median sleep duration has slightly decreased by 21 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.57). Sleep start time has become more consistent, with a decrease in standard deviation by 87 minutes (Z-score of delta -1.71), and a slight shift in the median start time by 5 minutes. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm has decreased by 0.09 (Z-score of delta -0.63), while intradaily variability has also decreased by 0.09 (Z-score of delta -0.86).

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes a significant increase in the Mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours) and resting heart rate, alongside an increase in the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm. These physiological changes suggest an elevated state of arousal or stress. Furthermore, the participant has increased their consumption of alcohol (Wine or Liquor). The decrease in interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate, while potentially indicating a more structured daily routine, may also reflect disruptions in the natural physiological rhythm.

Evidence for an improvement or stability in perceived stress is substantial. The participant shows a marked reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety levels (STAI), moving from clinically concerning ranges to lower levels. Self-esteem has increased, and health satisfaction has improved, indicating positive shifts in psychological well-being. Sleep duration has become more consistent, with a reduction in its standard deviation and sleep start time variability, suggesting improved sleep regulation. Reductions in time spent on passive recreational activities like watching TV/videos and internet usage, and a significant decrease in listening to music, could indicate a shift towards more active or engaging behaviors, although it could also reflect less time for relaxation.

Holistically analyzing these data, the significant improvements in key psychological indicators such as depression and anxiety, alongside increased self-esteem and health satisfaction, strongly suggest a reduction in overall perceived stress. While there are concerning physiological markers and changes in substance use and recreational habits, the amelioration of core psychological distress measures weighs more heavily in determining the overall direction of perceived stress. The positive psychological trajectory, particularly the reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicates an improvement in the participant's perceived stress.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
95543,-1.0,"The participant's self-reported mental health and well-being indicators show a notable increase in anxiety, as evidenced by a substantial rise in the STAI-Trait score from 23.0 (not anxious, Z-score -1.81) to 42.0 (anxious, Z-score 0.22). This represents a significant increase in proneness to chronic anxiety. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has decreased, with the happiness score dropping from 5.0 to 3.0, moving from a Z-score of 1.64 to -0.76. This decrease in happiness is associated with a negative correlation (r = -0.13) with changes in perceived stress. While the CES-D score has increased from 1.0 to 10.0, it remains within the ""Not depressed"" classification, albeit with a Z-score delta of 1.13, suggesting a slight increase in depressive symptom reporting, which is weakly correlated (r = 0.26) with stress changes. Self-esteem has shown a slight decline, with the score decreasing from 49.0 to 43.0, though it remains within a range of higher self-worth (Z-score delta of -1.09). Health satisfaction has also decreased, from a high score of 6.0 (Z-score 1.3) to 4.78 (Z-score 0.38), indicating a decline in perceived physical health.

Lifestyle and behavioral patterns reveal a significant shift in recreational activities. The participant has drastically reduced their engagement with ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" decreasing from 1-2 hours per day (Z-score 1.28) to 16-30 minutes (Z-score -0.19), a change correlated negatively with stress (r = -0.02). Conversely, there has been a substantial increase in ""Listening to Music,"" from ""Do not do"" (Z-score -1.19) to 3-4 hours per day (Z-score 1.62), a change strongly correlated with increases in perceived stress (r = 0.0). ""Video Games"" engagement has also increased, from 31 minutes to an hour to 1-2 hours per day (Z-score delta of 0.64), with a slight negative correlation to stress changes (r = -0.03). Physical activity trends show a decrease in exercising with others, from three times a week or more to 1-2 times a week (Z-score delta of -0.43), and a reduction in sports participation, from 1-2 times a month to less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score delta of -0.47). Sleep metrics indicate a decrease in median sleep duration by 40 minutes, falling to 6 hours and 45 minutes (Z-score delta -0.94). The median sleep start time has also become later by 30 minutes (Z-score delta 0.53).

Physiological data from wearable devices present a mixed picture. The overall regularity of the participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, has decreased significantly (delta -0.28, Z-score of delta -2.03). Intradaily Variability has slightly increased (delta 0.07, Z-score of delta 0.28), suggesting a potential increase in the fluctuation of heart rate within a 24-hour period. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has substantially decreased (delta -6.41, Z-score of delta -2.17), indicating a reduced peak-to-trough variation in heart rate over the day. The Mesor, representing the mid-point of the circadian rhythm, has also decreased (delta -6.65, Z-score of delta -1.22). Resting heart rate has shown a slight increase (delta 0.8, Z-score of delta 0.21). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general pattern of lower average heart rates during early morning hours (e.g., 4-7 am) in the current period compared to the previous one. However, there are notable increases in average heart rate during evening and late-night hours, particularly from 8-9 pm onwards, with the 8-9 pm hour showing the most pronounced increase (86.85 vs 101.73 bpm). This shift suggests a potential disruption in the typical diurnal heart rate pattern.

Overall, the participant exhibits a significant increase in anxiety and a decrease in self-reported happiness, alongside a decrease in health satisfaction. While some behavioral changes, such as reduced TV watching, might be considered beneficial, the substantial increase in listening to music is positively correlated with stress changes. The decrease in sleep duration and the later sleep onset are concerning. Physiologically, the reduced amplitude of the circadian rhythm and increased variability in heart rate suggest a less robust daily physiological cycle, coupled with elevated heart rates during later evening hours. These factors, particularly the heightened anxiety and reduced happiness, alongside sleep and physiological indicators, point towards an increase in perceived stress.

This participant exhibits several notable shifts in self-reported psychological states and behavioral patterns between the two data collection periods. A significant decrease in self-reported happiness is observed, moving from a Z-score of 1.64 to -0.76, indicating a substantial decline in subjective well-being. Concurrently, trait anxiety (STAI) has increased, with a score delta of 5.0 and a Z-score of 0.89, suggesting a rise in proneness to anxiety. Interpersonal trust has also improved, with a notable score delta of 0.83 and a Z-score of 1.96, indicating a greater degree of trust in others. Self-esteem shows a slight increase, with a score delta of 1.0 and a Z-score of 0.21, remaining in a relatively positive range.

In terms of lifestyle and health behaviors, the participant reports a decrease in weekday sleep duration from 6.0 hours to 5.0 hours, accompanied by a Z-score of delta of -1.11, and a reduction in perceived control over sleep duration. The feeling of control over sleep has shifted from ""Somewhat Agree"" to ""Neither Agree nor Disagree,"" with a change Z-score of -0.8. While the median sleep duration also decreased by 29 minutes, its Z-score delta is -0.74, suggesting this is a moderate, though not extreme, decline relative to the population. The median sleep start time has shifted significantly later, by 1 hour and 33 minutes, with a Z-score of delta of 1.72, indicating a substantial disruption in sleep timing. Additionally, alcohol consumption (beer) has increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" represented by a Z-score of delta of 0.7.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals an increase in the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (from 9.31 to 14.69, Z-score of delta 1.82), suggesting a greater diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. Interdaily stability of heart rate has also markedly improved (from 0.37 to 0.64, Z-score of delta 2.04), indicating a more regular daily pattern of physiological activity. The acrophase has shifted later by 23 minutes, to 5:17 PM, suggesting a later peak in heart rate activity. The resting heart rate has slightly increased by 2.1 bpm, though this change is not particularly large in magnitude (Z-score of delta 0.49). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows elevated heart rates during typical waking hours, with a noticeable peak in the late evening (around 10-11 PM), reaching as high as 91.66 bpm in the current period, compared to a peak of 85.47 bpm previously. The Mesor, representing the overall average heart rate, has slightly decreased.

Overall, this participant is experiencing a reduction in subjective happiness and an increase in trait anxiety, alongside a significant delay in sleep timing and a reduction in sleep duration. There are also increases in alcohol consumption and a widening of diurnal heart rate variability.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Analysis of the provided data indicates several factors that may contribute to an increase in perceived stress. The observed decrease in self-reported happiness (Delta: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.8) and the increase in trait anxiety (Delta: 5.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.89) are strong indicators of a worsening psychological state. The significant shift towards later sleep start times (Delta: 1 hour 33 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: 1.72) and the reduction in normal weekday sleep duration (Delta: -1.0 hours, Z-Score of Delta: -1.11) suggest disrupted sleep patterns, which are commonly associated with increased stress. Furthermore, the rise in beer consumption (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.7) and the elevated late-evening heart rates observed in the aggregated hourly data point towards potential increases in physiological arousal or unhealthy coping mechanisms. The increased amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Delta: 5.38, Z-Score of Delta: 1.82) also suggests greater physiological variability, which can be indicative of stress.

While there are some positive indicators, such as an improvement in interpersonal trust (Delta: 0.83, Z-Score of Delta: 1.96) and a slight increase in self-esteem, these do not appear to outweigh the negative shifts in happiness, anxiety, and sleep. The initial PSS score of 18.0, which was below the population mean (Z-Score: -0.98), combined with the negative correlation (-0.56) between initial PSS and changes in PSS, suggests that an initial lower stress state might be more susceptible to increases. However, the direct indicators of psychological distress and behavioral dysregulation are more salient in predicting the direction of change. The combination of decreased happiness, increased anxiety, and disrupted sleep strongly suggests an escalation in perceived stress.

67608,-3.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological and behavioral profile exhibits several notable shifts between the two data collection periods. Self-reported measures indicate a slight increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D score increased by 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.25) and a decrease in self-reported anxiety (STAI score decreased by 2.0, Z-score of delta -0.01), although both remain within the ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" classifications, respectively. Self-esteem and trust levels remained unchanged. Health satisfaction saw a moderate increase (Score Delta 0.67, Z-Score of Delta 0.57), and the Body Mass Index also slightly increased by 0.68. In terms of sleep habits, there was a significant reduction in the time taken to fall asleep (Sleep Latency decreased by 13.0 minutes, Z-score of delta -0.94), suggesting improved sleep onset. However, the feeling of control over sleep duration increased, shifting from ""Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Disagree"" (Delta 1.0, Change Z-Score 0.39).

Substance usage patterns show a notable decrease in wine or liquor consumption, moving from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num -2.0, Z-Score of Delta -2.24), while beer consumption remained stable. Exercise frequency, specifically exercising alone, has been maintained at ""Three times a week or more"" (Delta Num 0.0, Z-Score of Delta 0.06), and exercising with others also remained stable. However, participation in sports decreased from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num -1.0, Z-Score of Delta -0.47). Daily recreational habits also show a decrease in internet usage (Time Num decreased by 1.0, Z-Score of Delta -0.79) and an increase in socializing with friends (Time Num increased by 1.0, Z-Score of Delta 0.75).

Physiological data from the wearable device indicates a decrease in resting heart rate by 4.6 bpm (Z-Score of Delta -0.93), which is generally indicative of improved cardiovascular fitness. The mesor, a measure of the central tendency of the circadian rhythm, also decreased slightly (Delta -0.88, Z-Score of Delta 0.04). Conversely, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm increased (Delta 1.84, Z-Score of Delta 0.62), suggesting a potentially greater variation between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. Circadian rhythm regularity metrics show an increase in interdaily stability (Delta 0.06, Z-Score of Delta 0.48) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Delta 0.14, Z-Score of Delta 0.86), indicating a more consistent daily pattern. However, intradaily variability decreased (Delta -0.11, Z-Score of Delta -1.0), suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate within a 24-hour period. Median sleep duration decreased by 41 minutes (Z-Score of Delta -0.96), and sleep start time became slightly later by 16 minutes (Z-Score of Delta 0.28). The standard deviation of sleep duration increased significantly by 33 minutes (Z-Score of Delta 0.9), and the standard deviation of sleep start time also increased by 27 minutes (Z-Score of Delta 0.6).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is suggested by the decrease in median sleep duration and the increase in the variability of both sleep duration and sleep start times. The increase in the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm could also indicate greater physiological arousal and potential stress. Furthermore, a decrease in sports participation, while other exercise remained stable or increased, might represent a reduction in stress-relieving activities.

Evidence for a stable or decreased perceived stress is supported by the decrease in anxiety and the slight increase in depressive symptom scores which remained within normal ranges. Self-esteem and trust were stable. Health satisfaction and the reduction in wine or liquor consumption are positive indicators. The decrease in time spent on the internet and increase in socializing with friends suggest a shift towards more adaptive social behaviors. The reduction in resting heart rate is a positive physiological change. The improvement in interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours from wearable data suggests a more structured and potentially less chaotic daily rhythm. The significant reduction in sleep latency also points to improved sleep onset, which is generally associated with lower stress.

Considering the multimodal data, the reduction in resting heart rate, improved sleep latency, increased health satisfaction, and decreased consumption of alcohol are strong indicators of potential stress reduction. While there are some concerns regarding sleep duration and variability, these may be outweighed by the positive changes in other domains. The decrease in anxiety scores, despite a slight rise in depressive symptoms that remained low, also points towards a more stable or improved psychological state. The initial PSS score of 21.0, which is close to the population mean (Z-Score -0.17), and its moderate negative correlation with change (-0.56) suggests that individuals starting at this level of stress might experience a reduction over time.

The participant exhibits several notable changes in self-reported psychological and behavioral measures. There is a decrease in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a 3.0-point reduction on the CES-D scale, which moved from a Z-score of -0.24 to -0.48. Similarly, trait anxiety, measured by the STAI, decreased by 2.0 points, with its Z-score shifting from -0.43 to -0.50. Self-esteem also saw a decline of 3.0 points, though its Z-score remained relatively stable, moving from 0.68 to 0.33. Trust in others decreased slightly by 0.17 points, with its Z-score becoming more negative, shifting from -0.46 to -0.81. In terms of sleep, a significant increase in sleep latency by 10 minutes occurred, moving from 10.0 to 20.0 minutes, which is reflected in a positive Z-score of delta (0.44). The participant's feeling of control over sleep duration also diminished, shifting from 'Agree' to 'Somewhat Agree', represented by a negative delta of -1.0 and a Z-score of delta of -0.8.

Behavioral habits also show shifts. While beer consumption remained stable, wine or liquor consumption increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" a change of 1.0 in numerical value with a positive Z-score of delta (0.73). Exercise habits indicate a complete cessation of exercising alone, moving from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all,"" a decrease of 1.0 in frequency and a negative Z-score of delta (-0.79). Conversely, exercise with others and sports participation remained consistent. Daily recreation habits show a reduction in watching TV/videos/movies, decreasing by one category from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta of -0.82). A significant increase in video game time was observed, moving from ""Do not do"" to ""31 minutes an hour,"" a substantial delta of 3.0 and a high Z-score of delta of 2.09. Listening to music also decreased, from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""Do not do"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta of -0.54), and sedentary hobby time decreased from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""Do not do"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta of -0.65).

Physiological and circadian rhythm metrics reveal significant changes. Interdaily stability of heart rate significantly decreased by -0.31, with a substantial negative Z-score of delta (-2.25), indicating a substantial reduction in the regularity of the daily heart rate pattern. Intradaily variability, conversely, slightly increased by 0.04. Autocorrelation at 24 hours also decreased notably by -0.3, with a Z-score of delta of -2.13, suggesting a diminished predictability of heart rate from one day to the next. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm decreased significantly by -8.03, with a Z-score of delta of -2.72, indicating a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, decreased by -3.68. Resting heart rate remained stable. Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows some fluctuations; for instance, there is a notable peak in the 12-1 PM hour in the current data (81.63 bpm) compared to the previous data (91.56 bpm), and a peak in the 6-7 PM hour (87.84 bpm) compared to the previous data (94.87 bpm). Conversely, the 9-10 AM hour increased from 77.26 bpm to 79.67 bpm. Sleep duration remained stable with a minor increase of 8 minutes in median duration. However, median sleep start time advanced by 11 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep start time increased by 21 minutes, suggesting greater variability in when sleep begins.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The available data presents a mixed picture regarding changes in perceived stress. On one hand, there are indications of potential stress reduction, such as the decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI). The improvement in self-esteem, despite the slight score decrease, indicates a more stable self-perception. Furthermore, the observed reduction in television/video/movie watching and sedentary hobbies, coupled with increased video gaming and wine/liquor consumption, might suggest shifts in coping mechanisms or leisure activities that could influence stress levels. The decrease in the amplitude and autocorrelation of the circadian rhythm, along with reduced interdaily stability, could reflect a less regulated daily physiological pattern, which is often associated with increased stress or disrupted well-being. The increase in sleep latency and variability in sleep start times further supports a potential increase in stress or factors contributing to it. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and changes in the PSS score (-0.56) suggests that individuals with higher initial PSS scores tended to experience a decrease in stress over time, whereas those with lower initial PSS scores might have experienced an increase. Given the initial PSS score of 19.0 is below the average for this population (Z-score of -0.71), this correlation suggests a tendency towards stress increase for this participant. The specific correlations between changes in various metrics and changes in PSS scores are provided as aids but the holistic analysis points towards increased stress. The significant decrease in interdaily stability of heart rate and the substantial decrease in circadian amplitude, coupled with increased sleep latency and variability in sleep start times, are strong physiological indicators of heightened stress.

**Psychological State and Well-being:** The participant demonstrated a reduction in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a decrease of 4.0 points on the CES-D scale, moving from a classification of ""Depressed"" to ""Not depressed."" This improvement aligns with a significant decrease in trait anxiety, with the STAI score dropping by 6.0 points and moving from a moderately anxious classification to a less anxious state. Concurrently, self-esteem has notably increased, with a gain of 6.0 points on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, suggesting enhanced self-worth. Health satisfaction also improved, rising by 1.11 points on a 7-point scale. While trust and happiness scores remained stable, the observed positive shifts in depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-esteem, and health satisfaction collectively indicate an improved psychological state.

**Lifestyle and Behavioral Habits:** The participant's substance usage patterns have shifted towards increased frequency. Alcohol consumption, measured by both beer and wine/liquor intake, has increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" There was no change in recreational or non-prescribed drug use. In terms of daily recreational habits, there was a notable decrease in video game engagement, shifting from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""15 minutes or less."" Additionally, reading habits have declined significantly, with the participant reporting no longer reading compared to ""15 minutes or less"" previously. Conversely, time spent on sedentary hobbies has increased substantially, from ""1-2 hours"" to ""more than 4 hours."" There were no significant changes in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, listening to music, or socializing with friends. Exercise frequency across all categories (exercised alone, with others, and sports) remained at ""Not at all,"" with no change observed in the prior period.

**Sleep Patterns:** Subjective sleep duration expectations remained stable at 8.0 hours. However, the participant reported an increase in sleep latency by 5.0 minutes, moving from 10.0 to 15.0 minutes, and a decreased feeling of control over sleep duration. Objectively, median sleep duration decreased by 45 minutes, from 8 hours and 12 minutes to 7 hours and 26 minutes, falling below population norms. The median sleep start time shifted later by 50 minutes. While the standard deviation of sleep duration slightly increased, the standard deviation of sleep start time also increased. These objective and subjective sleep metrics indicate a worsening of sleep patterns, characterized by longer time to fall asleep, shorter actual sleep duration, and a later, less consistent sleep schedule.

**Physiological and Circadian Rhythm Metrics:** Resting heart rate has decreased by 4.8 beats per minute, now sitting at 66.4 bpm, which is closer to the population average. The mean heart rate during nighttime hours (e.g., 1-5 AM) has generally decreased, aligning with a lower resting heart rate. Conversely, several daytime hourly mean heart rates, particularly during mid-morning and afternoon peak periods (e.g., 9 AM - 6 PM), have shown a relative increase compared to the previous period. For example, the 11 AM - 12 PM hour increased from 98.29 to 86.82 (note: this is a decrease from prior, and this is a complex interplay of values), and the 12 PM - 1 PM hour decreased from 101.32 to 89.46. However, the overall trend of higher heart rates during peak activity periods persists. Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours, has shown marginal improvements. However, intradaily variability has decreased, suggesting a less fragmented heart rate pattern throughout the day. The Mesor, representing the overall 24-hour average heart rate, has significantly decreased, while the amplitude, representing the daily variation, has slightly reduced. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted slightly later.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress can be inferred from several behavioral and physiological indicators. The increase in alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor), a decrease in reading habits, and a substantial increase in sedentary hobbies suggest a potential shift towards less adaptive coping mechanisms or increased engagement in passive activities that may not mitigate stress. Objectively, the decrease in median sleep duration, a later and less stable sleep start time, and a reduced sense of control over sleep point to a deterioration in sleep quality, which is strongly linked to elevated stress levels. Physiologically, while the resting heart rate has decreased, indicating some potential improvement in baseline cardiovascular state, the increase in hourly heart rates during peak daytime hours suggests a potential for heightened physiological arousal during these periods.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is present in several psychological domains. The significant reduction in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with an increase in self-esteem and health satisfaction, are strong indicators of improved psychological well-being, which would likely contribute to lower perceived stress. The initial PSS score was 19.0 (Z-score -0.71), suggesting a baseline stress level slightly below average, and the correlation of the initial PSS score with changes to said score over time is -0.56, indicating that a lower initial PSS score is associated with larger decreases in PSS over time.

Holistically, the improvements in psychological well-being (reduced depression and anxiety, increased self-esteem and health satisfaction) are substantial and directly related to the constructs measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. While there are concerning trends in sleep and certain lifestyle behaviors (increased alcohol use, reduced reading, increased sedentary time), these do not directly negate the positive shifts in psychological health indicators. The decrease in resting heart rate is also a positive physiological sign. Considering the strong correlations between psychological well-being indicators and stress, and the negative correlation between initial PSS and change, the improvements in CES-D, STAI, Self-Esteem, and Health Satisfaction are likely to have a more direct impact on reducing overall perceived stress. Therefore, the overall perceived stress score is likely to have improved.

The participant's perceived stress, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) initial score of 23.0 (Z-Score: 0.38), suggests a moderate baseline level. Over the two-year period, several self-reported psychological and lifestyle factors have exhibited notable changes. Specifically, self-reported happiness has significantly decreased, with a score reduction of 2.0 (Z-Score of Delta: -1.80), correlating negatively (-0.14) with changes in PSS. This decline in happiness, despite remaining within the ""not depressed"" classification on the CES-D scale (Score Delta: 0.0), warrants attention. Anxiety, measured by the STAI, has increased by 3.0 (Z-Score of Delta: 0.63), indicating a higher proneness to situational anxiety. Conversely, self-esteem has seen a slight decrease of 2.0 (Z-Score of Delta: -0.35), and interpersonal trust has marginally increased by 0.17 (Z-Score of Delta: 0.31).

Behavioral patterns reveal a mixed profile. While substance usage and alcohol consumption remain stable, there have been significant increases in physical activity. Notably, exercising alone has increased from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.77), and participation in sports has risen substantially from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""Three times a week or more"" (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.28). However, recreational activities have shifted; video game usage has decreased by 2.0 ""time units"" (Z-Score of Delta: -1.54), and there has been an increase in sedentary hobbies (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.41) and socialising with friends (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.75).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 3.2 bpm (Z-Score of Delta: -0.64), falling below the population average. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a decrease in Mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours) by 6.28 bpm (Z-Score of Delta: -1.14), suggesting a generally lower cardiovascular activity. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) has shifted later by approximately 23 minutes to 4:17 PM. Interdaily stability has slightly increased, while intradaily variability has also slightly increased, suggesting a minor decrease in overall rhythm regularity. The autocorrelation at 24 hours has significantly decreased by -0.19 (Z-Score of Delta: -1.39), indicating a less pronounced daily rhythmicity. Sleep duration has slightly decreased by 32 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: -0.79), and the median sleep start time has shifted approximately 30 minutes earlier (Z-Score of Delta: -0.61).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of the perceived stress score is indicated by an increase in trait anxiety (STAI), a decrease in self-reported happiness, and a decrease in the Mesor of heart rate, suggesting a physiological shift towards lower overall activity that could be associated with heightened stress or other negative affect. Furthermore, the decreased autocorrelation at 24 hours suggests a less robust daily rhythm, which can be a marker of disrupted well-being.

Evidence for the improvement or stability of the PSS score is provided by a stable CES-D score indicating no increase in depressive symptoms, and significant increases in physical activity, particularly in sports and exercising alone, which are typically stress-reducing behaviors. The increase in socializing with friends also suggests positive social engagement. While resting heart rate has decreased, this could reflect improved cardiovascular health rather than increased stress, especially given the simultaneous increase in activity. Sleep duration has slightly decreased, but this is a modest change, and the initial sleep duration was above the population average.

Holistically, the decrease in self-reported happiness, coupled with an increase in trait anxiety and a less regular circadian rhythm, presents a concerning pattern that leans towards an increase in perceived stress. While positive behavioral changes such as increased exercise are present, their impact may be overshadowed by the declines in psychological well-being indicators and physiological rhythm disruption. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that higher initial stress levels might be associated with a decrease over time, but this participant started at a moderate level, and the observed changes suggest an exacerbation of stress rather than an improvement.

Daily recreation habits reveal a substantial increase in video game usage, from ""Do not do"" to ""16-30 minutes"" (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.36), and a notable decrease in internet usage from ""3-4 hours"" to ""1-2 hours"" (Delta Num: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.47). Listening to music has increased in duration, from ""2-3 hours"" to ""more than 4 hours"" (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.04).

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a higher resting heart rate in the current period (Delta: 7.6, Z-Score of Delta: 1.65), moving from a lower to a higher Z-score relative to the population. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a slight increase in interdaily stability of heart rate (Delta: 0.08, Z-Score of Delta: 0.63) and a minor decrease in intradaily variability (Delta: -0.02, Z-Score of Delta: -0.36). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has decreased (Delta: -2.07, Z-Score of Delta: -0.7), suggesting a reduced range of heart rate fluctuation across the day. Sleep duration shows a minor increase in median duration (Delta: '0 hours 5 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: -0.05), but a significant decrease in the variability of sleep duration, with the standard deviation dropping substantially from '136 minutes' to '57 minutes' (Delta: '-79 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: -1.77). The median sleep start time has shifted later by 55 minutes (Delta: '0 hours 55 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: 1.01), and there is a considerable increase in the standard deviation of sleep start time, from '67 minutes' to '172 minutes' (Delta: '104 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: 2.13). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a notable peak in heart rate in the evening (5-6 PM) in the current period (90.03 bpm) compared to the previous period (77.08 bpm).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress (increase) is suggested by several factors. The resting heart rate has increased notably, moving to a higher Z-score. The aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates a significant spike in heart rate between 5-6 PM in the current period compared to the previous. Furthermore, the participant has increased their beer consumption. Self-reported happiness has decreased, and health satisfaction has declined. The median sleep start time has shifted significantly later, and the variability of sleep start times has increased substantially, indicating a disruption in sleep schedule regularity.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability of perceived stress (decrease/stable) is also present. Self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms have both shown significant reductions. Self-esteem has slightly increased, and interpersonal trust has risen. Sleep duration variability has dramatically decreased, indicating a more consistent sleep duration. While the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased, the median sleep duration has slightly improved, and the decrease in sleep latency from the previous period ('-15.0 minutes', Z-Score of Delta: -1.06) suggests an improvement in falling asleep. There has been a reduction in internet usage time and an increase in engagement in sports.

Holistically, the significant reduction in self-reported anxiety and depression, coupled with improved sleep duration consistency and decreased sleep latency, points towards an improvement in the participant's perceived stress. While there are concerning indicators such as increased alcohol consumption, a higher resting heart rate with a pronounced evening peak, and later, more variable sleep start times, the amelioration of core psychological distress markers suggests an overall positive trajectory. The increased variability in sleep start times and the evening heart rate spike may warrant further investigation into potential lifestyle or environmental factors contributing to acute stress responses, but the dominant trend in core psychological metrics suggests a reduction in overall perceived stress.

71193,-12.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits notable shifts in psychological well-being and behavioral patterns between the two data collection periods. A significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D scale, is observed, with a score decrease of 21.0 points and a Z-score change of -2.19. Similarly, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, has substantially decreased by 19.0 points (Z-score delta of -2.2). Concurrently, self-esteem has increased by 12.0 points (Z-score delta of 2.24), reaching its maximum possible score. The participant's perceived health satisfaction has also improved, rising by 1.78 points (Z-score delta of 1.59). Trust in others has seen a modest increase of 1.0 point (Z-score delta of 2.37). In terms of sleep, while ideal weekday sleep duration has decreased by 1.0 hour, the reported normal weekday sleep duration has increased by 1.0 hour, suggesting a potential convergence between desired and actual sleep. The feeling of control over sleep duration has also strengthened, moving from ""Somewhat Agree"" to ""Agree."" Sleep latency has decreased by 10 minutes, and median sleep start time has advanced by 34 minutes, indicating earlier and potentially more consistent sleep initiation. Conversely, sleep duration variability has increased from 55 to 95 minutes.

Regarding activity and circadian rhythms, there has been a marked decrease in physical activity, with exercising alone dropping from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all."" While other forms of exercise remained unchanged, overall engagement in structured physical activity has diminished. This reduction in physical activity is associated with a decrease in Interdaily Stability of heart rate variability (from 0.72 to 0.52), suggesting a less predictable daily rhythm. Intradaily Variability has increased, indicating more fluctuation within the day, while Autocorrelation at 24 hours has decreased, further supporting a less consistent daily pattern. The Acrophase, or peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier from 6:01 PM to 4:25 PM. Resting heart rate has slightly increased by 1.35 bpm, and the Mesor, or average heart rate, has decreased by 3.49 bpm. The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has decreased from 14.57 to 11.35, implying a reduced range of heart rate variation throughout the day. In terms of aggregated hourly heart rate data, there is a notable reduction in elevated heart rates during late evening and night hours (e.g., 11 PM - 2 AM) and a significant increase in elevated heart rates during midday and early afternoon hours (e.g., 11 AM - 4 PM) compared to the previous period.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress can be inferred from the increased variability in sleep duration and the shift towards less regular daily activity patterns, as indicated by decreased Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours, and increased Intradaily Variability. The earlier Acrophase and decreased Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm also suggest potential disruptions. The higher correlation of the initial PSS score with subsequent changes (-0.56) suggests that individuals with higher initial stress levels may have experienced greater reductions in stress over time, which is partially supported by the significant decreases in depressive symptoms and anxiety.

Conversely, substantial evidence points towards an improvement or stability in perceived stress. The participant demonstrates significant reductions in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with a notable increase in self-esteem and health satisfaction. Improvements in sleep patterns, including reduced latency and earlier sleep onset, along with an increased sense of control over sleep, are also indicative of reduced stress. The increase in trust, although modest, may also contribute to improved psychological well-being. Furthermore, the decrease in Body Mass Index by 1.36 points could reflect positive health-related behavioral changes that often correlate with reduced stress. The negative correlations of changes in STAI, CES-D, and Self-Esteem with changes in PSS suggest that improvements in these psychological domains are associated with decreases in perceived stress.

Holistically, the significant positive changes in key psychological indicators such as reduced depression, anxiety, and increased self-esteem, alongside improvements in sleep quality and health satisfaction, strongly suggest an overall decrease in perceived stress. While some physiological and behavioral metrics indicate potential disruptions in daily rhythms, the overwhelming self-reported improvement in mental health and well-being provides robust evidence for a reduction in perceived stress.

71985,-4.0,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable decrease in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a significant reduction in the CES-D score (delta of -8.0, with a Z-score of delta at -0.75). Concurrently, the STAI-Trait anxiety score has also decreased by 5.0 points (Z-score of delta at -0.4), moving from an anxious classification to not anxious. Self-esteem has shown an improvement, with a score increase of 4.0 (Z-score of delta at 0.76). Happiness levels have decreased by 1.0 point (Z-score of delta at -0.96), and health satisfaction has slightly increased by 0.22 points (Z-score of delta at 0.15). Trust in others has decreased by 0.33 points (Z-score of delta at -0.93).

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a decrease in normal weekday sleep duration by 1.5 hours (Z-score of delta at -1.61), aligning with a decrease in the median sleep duration measured by the wearable by 35 minutes (Z-score of delta at -0.85). The standard deviation of sleep duration has also decreased significantly by 45 minutes (Z-score of delta at -0.97). A substantial shift in sleep onset timing is evident, with the median sleep start time becoming 2 hours later (Z-score of delta at 2.23), accompanied by a decrease in the variability of sleep start times by 33 minutes (Z-score of delta at -0.63). The feeling of control over sleep duration remains stable.

Behaviorally, there has been a notable decrease in exercise frequency, with the participant exercising alone 1-2 times a week compared to three times a week or more previously (delta of -1.0 in frequency number, Z-score of delta at -0.79). Exercise with others has also decreased substantially from 1-2 times a month to not at all (delta of -2.0 in frequency number, Z-score of delta at -1.15). Conversely, engagement in sports remains consistent. Recreational screen time has increased, with video game usage rising by 1 hour (Z-score of delta at 0.64). Reading time has also increased by 16-30 minutes, and sedentary hobby time has decreased. Substance usage across all categories remains at 'Not at all'.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has slightly increased by 0.6 bpm (Z-score of delta at 0.17). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals an overall pattern of elevated heart rates throughout the day in the current period compared to the previous. Specifically, the average heart rate during waking hours, particularly from late morning through the evening, shows a general increase. For instance, the 11 AM-12 PM hour increased from 72.42 to 80.03 bpm, and the 7 PM-8 PM hour from 77.55 to 80.08 bpm. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted later by 20 minutes to 5:14 PM. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity, such as Interdaily Stability, have decreased from 0.69 to 0.52 (Z-score of delta at -1.22), indicating less consistent daily patterns. Intradaily Variability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours remained relatively stable, though Intradaily Variability showed a slight decrease in its Z-score delta.

### Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress (worsening) is suggested by the shift in aggregated hourly heart rate data towards consistently higher levels during waking hours, particularly in the afternoon and evening, and a decrease in Interdaily Stability of the circadian rhythm. The later acrophase also indicates a potential disruption in the daily rhythm. Furthermore, there is a decrease in self-reported happiness and trust, and a significant reduction in both weekday sleep duration and the stability of sleep patterns, which can contribute to heightened stress. The increase in video game usage might also be indicative of altered coping mechanisms.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress (improvement/stable) is primarily seen in the significant reductions in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI-Trait). Self-esteem has also improved, and health satisfaction has shown a slight increase. Sleep latency and the feeling of control over sleep duration remain stable. Exercise with others and sports engagement, while showing some changes, indicate consistency in certain physical activities.

Holistically analyzing the evidence, the positive changes in the CES-D and STAI scores, alongside improved self-esteem, suggest a reduction in psychological distress related to depression and anxiety. However, the observed physiological changes, specifically the elevated heart rates during waking hours and reduced circadian rhythm regularity, combined with shorter and less stable sleep durations, point towards an increase in physiological stress markers. The later sleep start time also suggests a shift in daily routines that could be stress-related. Despite the improvements in certain self-reported psychological measures, the overall pattern of physiological dysregulation and altered sleep architecture leans towards a worsening of the participant's perceived stress.

98117,2.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several notable shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two assessment periods. Subjectively, there has been a significant increase in trait anxiety (STAI) by 13.0 points, elevating the Z-score from 1.16 to 2.7, indicating a marked rise in chronic anxiety proneness. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has decreased by 1.0 point, moving from a Z-score of -1.61 to -3.12, reflecting a substantial decline in subjective well-being. This subjective distress is accompanied by a significant decrease in self-esteem, with a score delta of -13.0 and a Z-score of delta of -2.39, suggesting a substantial reduction in self-worth. While depressive symptoms (CESD) remain elevated and classified as ""Depressed,"" there has been no change in the score, indicating a stable, high level of depressive symptomatology.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant has significantly increased their self-reported normal weekday sleep duration by 2.5 hours (Z-score of delta 2.44), moving from a severely restricted 3.0 hours to 5.5 hours. This increase in reported sleep duration is accompanied by a higher feeling of control over sleep duration, shifting from ""Somewhat Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Agree"" (Delta of 2.0, Z-score of delta 0.98). Conversely, there has been a substantial reduction in internet usage, decreasing by 3.0 hours (Z-score of delta -2.14), and a slight decrease in listening to music by 1 hour (Z-score of delta -0.54). Physical activity shows a modest increase in exercising alone (Delta Num 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.91), while other forms of exercise and sports remain unchanged. Trust in others has seen a marginal increase of 0.17 (Z-score of delta 0.31).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a more structured and stable circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability has significantly increased (Delta 0.33, Z-score of delta 2.48), suggesting a more regular daily pattern in heart rate. This is further supported by an increase in autocorrelation at 24 hours (Delta 0.25, Z-score of delta 1.61), indicating improved synchrony between consecutive days. Intradaily variability has slightly increased (Delta 0.06, Z-score of delta 0.21), which, in conjunction with increased interdaily stability, may reflect a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has notably increased (Delta 5.57, Z-score of delta 1.88), suggesting a larger range between peak and trough heart rate, potentially reflecting greater physiological responsiveness. The acrophase has shifted slightly later by approximately 8 minutes. The mesor, representing the overall average heart rate, has remained relatively stable (Delta 0.17, Z-score of delta 0.27). Resting heart rate has marginally decreased by 0.8 beats per minute. Sleep statistics indicate a decrease in median sleep duration by 21 minutes and a significant reduction in sleep duration variability (Delta -82 minutes, Z-score of delta -1.85), suggesting more consistent sleep nights. The median sleep start time has advanced by over an hour, and sleep start time variability has dramatically decreased (Delta -173 minutes, Z-score of delta -3.44), indicating a significant regularization of sleep onset.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is primarily derived from the significant elevations in self-reported trait anxiety (STAI), a decrease in self-reported happiness, and a substantial decline in self-esteem. The increase in trait anxiety (Z-score of delta 1.91) and the decrease in happiness (Z-score of delta -0.96) are particularly indicative of heightened distress. While not directly measuring perceived stress, these psychological markers are strongly associated with increased subjective stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress can be inferred from several behavioral and physiological changes. The significant increase in self-reported normal weekday sleep duration (Z-score of delta 2.44), coupled with an improved sense of control over sleep, suggests better self-care and potentially reduced stress related to sleep deprivation. The dramatic reduction in sleep start time variability (Z-score of delta -3.44) and improved sleep duration consistency point towards a more regulated sleep-wake cycle, which is often protective against stress. Furthermore, the increased interdaily stability (Z-score of delta 2.48) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of delta 1.61) in wearable data indicate a more structured daily routine, which can contribute to reduced stress. The decrease in internet usage also suggests a potential shift away from sedentary, potentially isolating activities.

Considering the multimodal data, the significant increase in trait anxiety, coupled with a marked decrease in happiness and self-esteem, strongly suggests an overall worsening of the participant's perceived stress. While improvements in sleep regulation and circadian rhythm stability are positive indicators, they appear to be overshadowed by the profound negative shifts in core psychological well-being measures. The initial PSS score's correlation with change (-0.56) suggests that participants with higher initial PSS scores tend to experience a decrease in PSS over time, but this participant's initial PSS score was close to the population mean. The changes in STAI, happiness, and self-esteem are of a magnitude that strongly implies an increase in perceived stress.

24883,3.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

Analysis of the provided data reveals several notable shifts in the participant's psychological and behavioral profiles between the two data collection periods. Self-reported measures indicate a general trend towards improved mood and reduced anxiety. Specifically, the CES-D score decreased by 2.0 points (Z-score of Delta: -0.09), suggesting a reduction in depressive symptoms, and the STAI-Trait score also decreased by 2.0 points (Z-score of Delta: -0.01), indicating a slight decrease in chronic anxiety proneness. Concurrently, self-reported happiness increased by 1.0 point (Z-score of Delta: 0.71), and trust increased by 1.0 point (Z-score of Delta: 2.37), moving from a below-average to an above-average Z-score. Self-esteem also saw a modest increase of 1.0 point (Z-score of Delta: 0.21).

However, these positive self-perceptions are contrasted by significant changes in sleep habits and activity patterns. The participant reported a decrease in ideal weekday sleep time by 1.0 hour (Z-score of Delta: -0.7) and a corresponding 1.0-hour decrease in normal weekday sleep duration (Z-score of Delta: -1.11). This reduction in perceived and actual sleep duration is accompanied by a diminished sense of control over sleep duration, moving from ""Disagree"" to ""Strongly Disagree"" (Delta: -1.0, Change Z-Score: -0.8). The median sleep duration also decreased by 41 minutes (Z-score of Delta: -0.96), and the standard deviation of sleep duration significantly increased by 66 minutes (Z-score of Delta: 1.67), indicating greater variability and potentially more disrupted sleep. Furthermore, the participant has ceased exercising alone (Delta Num: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.65) and has reduced time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Delta Num: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.46) and on the internet (Delta Num: -3.0, Z-Score of Delta: -2.14).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 3.05 beats per minute (Z-score of Delta: 0.69), moving towards the population average. The Mesor, a measure of average heart rate over a 24-hour period, has also slightly increased by 1.39 (Z-score of Delta: 0.53). While intradaily variability in heart rate has increased slightly (Delta: 0.08, Z-score of Delta: 0.35), interdaily stability has improved (Delta: 0.12, Z-score of Delta: 0.93), suggesting a more consistent daily rhythm in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier by approximately one hour, from 7:07 PM to 6:01 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals an elevated heart rate during daytime and early evening hours in the current period compared to the previous, particularly between 4-5 PM (82.83 vs 69.47) and 11 PM-12 AM (76.92 vs 82.75, though the latter saw a previous spike). Conversely, some overnight hours appear to have slightly lower average heart rates in the current period, though this is less pronounced.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 23.0, which is slightly above the population average (Z-Score: 0.38), serves as a baseline. The provided correlation of -0.56 between the initial PSS score and changes in the PSS score over time suggests that higher initial stress was associated with a decrease in stress. However, this analysis is based on the correlation between initial score and *change*, not on the absolute change in PSS which is not directly provided in this dataset.

Evidence for a potential worsening of perceived stress can be inferred from several behavioral and physiological indicators. The significant reduction in reported sleep duration, coupled with a decreased sense of control over sleep and increased sleep duration variability, are strong indicators of increased stress and disrupted well-being. The increase in resting heart rate and Mesor, despite some improvements in circadian rhythm stability, might suggest a heightened physiological arousal. The reduction in social activities and exercise also point towards potential withdrawal or reduced coping mechanisms, which can be associated with increased stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is present in the self-reported psychological measures. The decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D), anxiety (STAI-Trait), and increases in happiness and trust suggest a positive shift in emotional state. The initial PSS score's correlation with change further suggests a potential for stress reduction if the initial stress level was high.

Holistically, the reduction in sleep quality and quantity, along with the increased resting heart rate, are compelling indicators that are often directly linked to increased perceived stress. While the self-reported mood measures show improvement, the objective measures of sleep and physiological arousal suggest a potential increase in underlying stress. The correlation of the initial PSS with change is a complex factor and without the actual PSS change score, it's difficult to definitively rely on it as a sole indicator of improvement. However, the combination of disrupted sleep, increased physiological arousal, and reduced engagement in healthy coping behaviors present a stronger case for an increase in perceived stress.

**Self-Reported Psychological and Lifestyle Changes:**
The participant reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a decrease of 6.0 points on the CES-D scale (Z-score of Delta: -0.53), moving from a moderately indicative range to a non-depressed classification. Similarly, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, decreased by 4.0 points (Z-score of Delta: -0.27), shifting from an anxious to a non-anxious classification. Self-esteem remained stable (0.0 change, Z-score of Delta: 0.02), and trust also showed no change (Z-score of Delta: -0.1). There was a notable decrease in self-reported happiness, with a score delta of -2.0 (Z-score of Delta: -1.8), moving from a score above the mean to a score below the mean. Health satisfaction significantly increased by 2.0 points (Z-score of Delta: 1.8), moving from a below-average to an above-average score. Regarding sleep, while the desired sleep duration and perceived control over sleep remained unchanged, perceived sleep latency increased by 5.0 minutes (Z-score of Delta: 0.14), although this increase is within a generally acceptable range.

**Behavioral Habits and Activity Patterns:**
Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, increased from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (Usage Delta Num: 2.0 for both). Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug usage remained at ""Not at all."" A substantial increase in exercise frequency was observed, particularly in exercising alone (Frequency Delta Num: 3.0, Z-score of Delta: 2.62), moving from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""Three times a week or more."" Sports participation also increased (Frequency Delta Num: 2.0, Z-score of Delta: 1.6), moving from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" Conversely, exercising with others decreased in frequency (Frequency Delta Num: -1.0, Z-score of Delta: -0.43). Daily recreation habits showed an increase in internet usage (Time Num Delta: 2.0, Z-score of Delta: 1.22) and listening to music (Time Num Delta: 2.0, Z-score of Delta: 1.04). Socializing with friends also increased (Time Num Delta: 1.0, Z-score of Delta: 0.75), and reading increased from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (Time Num Delta: 1.0, Z-score of Delta: 0.6).

**Wearable-Derived Physiological and Circadian Metrics:**
The participant's resting heart rate decreased by 2.6 beats per minute (Z-score of Delta: -0.51), moving from a below-average to a significantly below-average resting heart rate (Current Z-Score: -1.88). This is accompanied by a notable increase in the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Delta: 2.23, Z-score of Delta: 0.75), suggesting a greater variation between peak and trough heart rate. The acrophase, representing the time of peak heart rate, shifted significantly earlier in the day, from 5:32 PM to 1:18 PM. Interdaily stability of heart rate showed a slight increase (Delta: 0.01, Z-score of Delta: 0.11), indicating a marginal improvement in daily rhythm regularity. Intradaily variability showed a minimal decrease (Delta: -0.01, Z-score of Delta: -0.29), suggesting a slight reduction in short-term heart rate fluctuations within a day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased substantially (Delta: 0.15, Z-score of Delta: 0.93), indicating a stronger daily pattern in heart rate. Median sleep duration increased slightly (Delta: 9 minutes, Z-score of Delta: 0.02), and the standard deviation of sleep duration increased by 10 minutes (Z-score of Delta: 0.34), suggesting greater variability in sleep duration. The median sleep start time shifted significantly earlier by nearly 2 hours (Delta: 1 hour 59 minutes, Z-score of Delta: -2.28), and the standard deviation of sleep start time remained stable (Delta: 0 minutes, Z-score of Delta: 0.02).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The data presents a complex picture of changes in the participant's psychological and behavioral landscape. On the positive side, there are significant improvements in self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, alongside a marked increase in health satisfaction. The participant has also adopted healthier lifestyle behaviors, including increased exercise and reading, and a shift towards earlier sleep onset. The decrease in resting heart rate and the earlier acrophase suggest potential physiological adaptations that could be indicative of reduced stress or improved well-being.

However, several factors warrant consideration for their potential impact on perceived stress. The decrease in self-reported happiness is a concerning indicator that directly contrasts with improvements in other mood-related measures. Furthermore, an increase in the perceived sleep latency, while modest, may contribute to feelings of stress. The increase in beer and wine/liquor consumption, even if to a moderate level, could also be a coping mechanism that does not fundamentally reduce stress. The increase in the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm, while potentially reflecting a more robust circadian signal, could also suggest heightened physiological arousal or strain if not accompanied by corresponding behavioral regulation. The increase in the standard deviation of sleep duration indicates less consistent sleep patterns, which can be a source of stress.

Considering the conflicting indicators, particularly the decrease in happiness alongside improvements in depression and anxiety, it is difficult to definitively conclude a clear direction of perceived stress. The initial PSS score was at the population mean (Z-Score: 0.1), and its correlation with change (-0.56) suggests that individuals starting at this level tend to see a decrease in PSS over time. The significant positive changes in health satisfaction and the positive trend in exercise frequency and sleep timing could mitigate stress. Conversely, the drop in happiness and increased variability in sleep patterns are potential stressors.

Given the substantial improvements in key indicators of mental well-being like depression and anxiety, coupled with positive lifestyle shifts like increased exercise and earlier sleep, the evidence leans towards a reduction in overall perceived stress, despite the notable decline in happiness. The improvements in direct measures of distress (depression, anxiety) and the adoption of healthier habits are strong indicators that perceived stress has likely not increased. The decrease in resting heart rate and earlier acrophase are also supportive of a reduction in physiological stress load.

The participant exhibits notable shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods, which warrant careful consideration in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported emotional states show a significant increase in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a substantial rise in the CES-D score (delta of 16.0, Z-score of delta 1.9), moving from a depressed classification to a higher burden of depressive symptoms. Concurrently, trait anxiety, measured by the STAI, has also elevated (delta of 10.0, Z-score of delta 1.53), suggesting a worsening in baseline anxiety proneness. While self-esteem remained relatively stable (delta of 3.0, Z-score of delta 0.58), there was a decrease in self-reported happiness (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.96). Interpersonal trust also saw a positive shift, with the score increasing by 0.67 (Z-score of delta 1.55), indicating a greater belief in others.

Lifestyle and activity patterns reveal several significant changes. A marked reduction in physical activity is evident, with exercising alone decreasing from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta num -2.0, Z-score of delta -1.65), and exercising with others shifting from ""Not at all"" to remaining ""Not at all"" but with a decrease in frequency (delta num 0.0, Z-score of delta 0.28).

A substantial decrease in listening to music, from ""2-3 hours"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (delta num -4.0, Z-score of delta -2.11), and a decrease in socializing with friends, from ""2-3 hours"" to ""31 minutes an hour"" (delta num -2.0, Z-score of delta -1.39), were also observed. Sleep patterns show a significant improvement in subjective sleep quality, with a marked reduction in sleep latency from ""45.0 minutes"" to ""20.0 minutes"" (delta of -25.0 minutes, Z-score of delta -1.66). This subjective improvement in sleep latency is juxtaposed with an increase in median sleep duration from ""6 hours 38 minutes"" to ""8 hours 8 minutes"" (delta of 1 hour 30 minutes, Z-score of delta 1.62).

Physiological data from the wearable device indicate a significant increase in the regularity of the participant's daily rhythm, as evidenced by an increase in Interdaily Stability (delta 0.13, Z-score of delta 1.0) and a decrease in Intradaily Variability (delta -0.27, Z-score of delta -2.14). The autocorrelation at 24 hours also increased (delta 0.22, Z-score of delta 1.4), suggesting a more defined daily cycle. The Mesor, reflecting the daily average heart rate, has decreased (delta -5.41, Z-score of delta -0.95), and the Acrophase has shifted earlier in the day. The participant's resting heart rate has slightly increased (delta 0.6, Z-score of delta 0.17). Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general trend of reduced high-intensity periods and an overall flatter diurnal pattern compared to the previous period. Specifically, the evening and night hours show reduced average heart rates.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The evidence for an increase in perceived stress is substantial, driven by significant deteriorations in key psychological indicators. The notable rise in CES-D scores (delta 16.0, Z-score of delta 1.9) and STAI scores (delta 10.0, Z-score of delta 1.53) points towards a heightened experience of depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. This increase in negative affect, combined with a decrease in self-reported happiness (delta -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.96), strongly suggests an escalation of psychological distress. While the improvement in sleep latency and increased total sleep duration are positive, they appear insufficient to counteract the adverse trends in mood and anxiety. The reduction in physical activity and social engagement further suggests a potential withdrawal or decreased capacity to cope with stressors. The physiological data showing increased rhythm regularity, particularly decreased intradaily variability and a lower Mesor, could be interpreted in the context of reduced activity and potentially a blunted stress response. However, the concurrent increase in negative affect overrides these potential positive physiological adaptations.

The correlation of the initial PSS score with changes in said score is -0.56, indicating that individuals with higher initial PSS scores experienced a decrease in PSS over time. Given the participant's initial PSS score of 24.0, which is above the midpoint and suggests moderate stress, this correlation would predict a decrease in PSS for this participant. However, the observed significant increases in CES-D and STAI scores, along with a decrease in happiness, strongly indicate an increase in perceived stress. The data on CES-D and STAI are directly indicative of increased psychological distress which is a core component of perceived stress. Despite the negative correlation suggesting a potential decrease in PSS for individuals with higher initial scores, the direct measures of psychological distress show a clear worsening. Therefore, the overall direction of change in perceived stress appears to be an increase.

99733,-3.0,"The participant's self-reported data reveals several notable shifts in psychological and behavioral indicators. Notably, the individual's perception of being in control over their sleep duration has significantly increased, moving from 'Agree' to 'Strongly Agree,' a change with a high Z-score for the delta. This is accompanied by a substantial increase in their ideal weekday sleep time and their normal weekday sleep duration, both of which moved from below average to well above average for the population. Concurrently, there has been a positive shift in happiness and health satisfaction scores, with both increasing and exceeding their previous values and population norms. Interpersonal trust has also seen a marked increase, with a considerable positive delta and a high Z-score for this change. Conversely, the participant reports a slight increase in sleep latency, though this remains within average population parameters.

In terms of behavioral patterns derived from wearable data, there is a significant improvement in the regularity of the participant's circadian rhythm, evidenced by a substantial increase in Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours. This suggests a more structured and predictable daily pattern. Concurrently, the Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm), representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, has also increased, moving from below average to above average for the population. While the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has slightly increased, it remains within population norms. Resting heart rate has also increased, moving from just above the average to a more substantial positive Z-score. Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates a notable decrease in elevated heart rate during the morning (8-11 AM) and early afternoon (1-3 PM) in the current period compared to the previous one. However, the current period shows higher mean heart rates during the late afternoon and evening (4-9 PM). The standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased significantly, suggesting more consistent sleep patterns, while the median sleep start time has become earlier, though its standard deviation has also decreased.

27407,1.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological and behavioral data reveal several notable shifts between the two data collection periods, with some indicators suggesting an increase in perceived stress. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) itself shows a correlation of -0.56 with changes in the participant's scores, indicating that individuals who experienced greater decreases in PSS also showed larger changes in other metrics.

From a self-report perspective, the participant's anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI, has remained high, with a score of 49.0 (Z-score 0.94) currently, only a slight decrease of 1.0 from the previous assessment (Z-score 0.86). Similarly, the CES-D score, assessing depressive symptoms, has remained within the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a minor decrease of 1.0 (Z-score of Delta 0.02). Self-esteem and happiness scores have remained stable, with no change recorded in the current period. Health satisfaction has slightly decreased by -0.11 (Z-score of Delta -0.15), moving from a previous Z-score of -0.53 to -0.67. Interpersonal trust has also remained stable.

Behavioral habits show mixed patterns. The participant has increased their alcohol consumption, with beer usage moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (Delta Num 1.0, Z-Score of Delta 0.7). Wine or liquor usage also increased from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num 1.0, Z-Score of Delta 0.73). In terms of physical activity, there has been a notable increase in exercising alone, from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Three times a week or more"" (Delta Num 1.0, Z-Score of Delta 0.91). However, exercising with others has decreased from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num -1.0, Z-Score of Delta -0.43). Sports frequency remains stable. Leisurely activities show some shifts: internet usage has decreased from ""1-2 hours"" to ""31 minutes an hour"" (Delta Num -1.0, Z-Score of Delta -0.79), and reading has decreased from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""Do not do"" (Delta Num -1.0, Z-Score of Delta -1.01). Conversely, engagement in sedentary hobbies has increased from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""31 minutes an hour"" (Delta Num 2.0, Z-Score of Delta 0.9).

Physiological data from the Fitbit presents a complex picture. Interdaily stability of heart rate has slightly decreased (-0.02, Z-score of Delta -0.11), while intradaily variability has increased significantly (0.15, Z-score of Delta 0.84). The autocorrelation at 24 hours has decreased (-0.07, Z-score of Delta -0.57). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted later by 42 minutes (Delta 0.78). The mesor, representing the average heart rate, has increased by 2.56 (Z-score of Delta 0.79), and the amplitude has slightly decreased (-0.81, Z-score of Delta -0.28). The resting heart rate has increased by 1.1 beats per minute (Z-score of Delta 0.27). Aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates higher average heart rates during late evening hours (7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM) compared to the previous period. Sleep duration has slightly increased by 19 minutes (Z-score of Delta 0.23), but the median sleep start time has become significantly later by 42 minutes (Z-score of Delta 0.78). The standard deviation of sleep start time has also increased by 18 minutes (Z-score of Delta 0.41).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The data presents a nuanced view of the participant's perceived stress. On one hand, self-reported measures of depression and anxiety have remained relatively stable, with slight improvements in CES-D and a marginal decrease in STAI scores. Self-esteem and happiness also remain unchanged. However, there are indicators that may suggest an increase in stress. The increase in alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor) is a behavioral change that can be associated with stress coping mechanisms. The decrease in exercising with others and the significant reduction in reading time, coupled with an increase in sedentary hobbies, suggest a potential shift away from social and enriching activities towards more passive ones, which could be stress-induced.

Physiologically, the data presents more concerning signs. The significant increase in intradaily variability of heart rate (0.15, Z-score of Delta 0.84) and the later acrophase (42 minutes, Z-score of Delta 0.78) suggest a disruption in the participant's circadian rhythm, which is often linked to increased stress and poorer health outcomes. The increase in the mesor (2.56, Z-score of Delta 0.79) and resting heart rate (1.1, Z-score of Delta 0.27) further point towards a state of heightened physiological arousal. The later median sleep start time (42 minutes, Z-score of Delta 0.78) and increased variability in sleep timing (18 minutes, Z-score of Delta 0.41) indicate a less regulated sleep schedule, which is a common consequence of elevated stress. While total sleep duration has slightly increased, the qualitative aspects of sleep regulation appear to have worsened. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that those with higher initial stress might have experienced greater reductions in stress, but this does not preclude an overall increase for this specific participant if other indicators point that way. However, the combination of increased alcohol intake, reduced social engagement, increased sedentary habits, and clear disruptions in circadian rhythm and sleep timing, alongside elevated average heart rates during the evening, strongly suggests a worsening of the participant's stress levels.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
43794,-3.0,"The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was 26.0, which is above the average for the study population (Z-Score = 1.19). This indicates a higher initial level of perceived stress. Analysis of the data reveals several significant shifts in behavioral and physiological metrics between the two collection periods, with notable implications for stress perception.

**Self-Reported Data Analysis:**

The participant reported no change in depressive symptoms (CES-D score delta of 0.0) and no change in happiness (Happy score delta of 0.0). However, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, decreased by 3.0 points (Z-Score of Delta = -0.14), moving from a score indicating anxiety (Previous Z-Score = 1.35) to a slightly less anxious state (Current Z-Score = 1.25). Self-esteem remained stable (Score Delta = 0.0). A significant increase was observed in health satisfaction, with a score delta of 3.33 (Z-Score of Delta = 3.03), shifting from a low satisfaction level (Previous Z-score = -1.45) to a considerably higher one (Current Z-score = 1.08). Interpersonal trust also saw a substantial increase, with a score delta of 0.83 (Z-Score of Delta = 1.96), moving from a below-average score (Previous Z-Score = -0.78) to an above-average score (Current Z-Score = 0.79).

In terms of sleep habits, sleep latency remained constant at 10.0 minutes. The desired and normal weekday sleep durations also remained consistent at 8.0 hours and 8.0 hours, respectively. However, the reported normal weekday sleep duration increased by 1.0 hour from the previous period (Z-Score of Delta = 0.92), moving from 7.0 to 8.0 hours, which is now well above the population average (Current Z-Score = 1.44). The feeling of control over sleep duration remained in the ""Disagree"" category, with no change in score or Z-score of delta.

Behaviorally, substance usage of beer increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (Delta Num = 2.0, Z-Score of Delta = 1.66), indicating a notable rise in alcohol consumption. Exercise habits shifted, with a decrease in exercising with others (Delta Num = -3.0, Z-Score of Delta = -1.86) and sports participation (Delta Num = -2.0, Z-Score of Delta = -1.16), while exercising alone increased (Delta Num = 1.0, Z-Score of Delta = 0.91). Daily recreational activities showed an increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Delta Num = 1.0, Z-Score of Delta = 0.46) and playing video games (Delta Num = 2.0, Z-Score of Delta = 1.36). Conversely, there was a decrease in internet usage (Delta Num = -1.0, Z-Score of Delta = -0.79) and socialising with friends (Delta Num = -1.0, Z-Score of Delta = -0.68). Time spent listening to music decreased slightly (Delta Num = -1.0, Z-Score of Delta = -0.54) after being at the highest level previously. Reading and sedentary hobbies remained at ""Do not do.""

**Wearable-Derived Data Analysis:**

Wearable data indicates a significant improvement in the regularity of the participant's circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability, a measure of consistency in daily patterns, increased substantially by 0.31 (Z-Score of Delta = 2.33), moving from a very low level (Previous Z-Score = -2.02) to an average level (Current Z-Score = 0.53). This is accompanied by an increase in Autocorrelation at 24 Hours by 0.26 (Z-Score of Delta = 1.67), indicating stronger daily periodicity. Intradaily Variability, a measure of fluctuation within a day, decreased slightly by -0.04 (Z-Score of Delta = -0.50), moving from slightly above average variability to slightly below average. The Acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, shifted earlier from 6:03 PM to 4:23 PM. The Mesor, the daily average heart rate, decreased slightly by -1.89 (Z-Score of Delta = -0.18), remaining close to the population average. However, the Amplitude, representing the range of heart rate variation, nearly tripled, increasing by 8.09 (Z-Score of Delta = 2.74), moving from a very low value to a high value.

A significant positive change was observed in Resting Heart Rate, which decreased by 13.5 beats per minute (Z-Score of Delta = -2.82), moving from a high resting heart rate (Previous Z-Score = 2.09) to a value within the population average (Current Z-Score = 0.50). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a substantial increase in heart rate during the afternoon and evening hours, particularly between 1 PM and 7 PM, which were previously closer to resting levels. For instance, the 1-2 PM hour increased from 81.28 to 91.42, and the 5-6 PM hour increased from 83.88 to 87.97. Conversely, morning hours showed a general decrease in heart rate.

Sleep duration saw a modest increase of 23 minutes (Z-Score of Delta = 0.31), bringing the median sleep duration to 7 hours and 23 minutes, which is now slightly above average. The standard deviation of sleep duration decreased by 37 minutes (Z-Score of Delta = -0.78), indicating more consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time shifted slightly earlier by 3 minutes, with no significant change in its standard deviation. However, the standard deviation of sleep start time increased substantially by 49 minutes (Z-Score of Delta = 1.03), suggesting more variability in when the participant begins sleeping.

**Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress:**

The participant's initial PSS score of 26.0 indicated a higher than average level of perceived stress. While several self-report measures suggest positive shifts, such as improved health satisfaction, decreased trait anxiety, and increased trust, other indicators present a more complex picture. The substantial increase in beer consumption and the shift in exercise patterns, with a decrease in social and sports activities, could be associated with increased stress. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a significant increase in the amplitude of heart rate variation, particularly pronounced in the afternoon and evening, alongside a substantial decrease in resting heart rate. The earlier acrophase and increased variability in sleep start times also suggest a disruption in circadian rhythm regularity, despite improvements in overall interdaily stability. The increase in PSS is negatively correlated with the initial PSS score (-0.56), suggesting that higher initial stress might be associated with greater change, which in turn could be an increase. The increase in the amplitude of heart rate variation, a physiological indicator often linked to stress, coupled with the rise in alcohol consumption and certain shifts in daily activities, points towards a potential increase in perceived stress. While there are positive indicators like improved health satisfaction and reduced trait anxiety, the combined physiological and behavioral shifts suggest a worsening of the participant's overall perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates a general trend towards reduced distress and improved well-being. A notable decrease of 3.0 points (Z-score of -0.2) was observed in the CES-D scale, which assesses depressive symptoms, moving from a score of 4.0 to 1.0. Similarly, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, decreased by 4.0 points (Z-score of -0.27), from 35.0 to 31.0, suggesting a reduction in chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem also showed a decrease of 3.0 points (Z-score of -0.53), moving from 45.0 to 42.0, though this metric's Z-score indicates it remains relatively high compared to the population. Health satisfaction demonstrated a slight increase of 0.22 points (Z-score of 0.15), indicating a modest rise in perceived physical health. Notably, there was no change in self-reported happiness scores, which remained at 3.0, with a Z-score delta of 0.0.

Behavioral patterns reveal shifts in sleep habits and leisure activities. The time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency) increased by 3.0 minutes (Z-score of 0.02), moving from 7.0 to 10.0 minutes, suggesting a slight difficulty in initiating sleep. However, the self-reported feeling of control over sleep duration decreased, with the participant moving from ""Agree"" to ""Somewhat Agree"" (a delta of -1.0 and a Z-score of -0.8), indicating a reduced perception of agency over their sleep. Physical activity shows a reduction in participation in sports, decreasing from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (a delta of -2.0 and a Z-score of -1.16). Conversely, time spent on internet usage and listening to music has increased, with internet usage rising by 1-2 hours (delta of 1.0 and Z-score of 0.55) and listening to music shifting from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (delta of 1.0 and Z-score of 0.52). Socializing with friends also saw an increase in reported time, from 1-2 hours to 2-3 hours (delta of 1.0 and Z-score of 0.75). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, remained stable with no change in reported frequency.

Physiological data from wearable devices indicate a notable decrease in overall resting heart rate and improvements in circadian rhythm regulation. The resting heart rate decreased by 9.3 beats per minute (Z-score of -1.93), from 74.3 to 65.0, which is a significant reduction and falls below the population average. This reduction in resting heart rate is accompanied by a substantial decrease in Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, by 8.3 bpm (Z-score of -1.58). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm, representing the range of daily heart rate variation, increased by 0.76 bpm (Z-score of 0.25), suggesting a potentially more pronounced daily fluctuation. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, shifted earlier from 7:59 PM to 4:43 PM. Measures of sleep regularity also show improvement; Interdaily Stability, reflecting the consistency of the circadian rhythm across days, decreased by 0.1 (Z-score of -0.7), while Intradaily Variability, indicating the variability within a 24-hour period, also decreased by 0.21 (Z-score of -1.71). Sleep duration increased by a significant 1 hour and 10 minutes (Z-score of 1.24), with median sleep duration now at 7 hours and 25 minutes. However, the standard deviation of sleep start time increased by 34 minutes (Z-score of 0.73), indicating less consistent sleep onset times.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress is limited. While sleep latency increased by 3 minutes and the feeling of control over sleep duration decreased slightly, these changes are small and have weak correlations with changes in PSS. The reduction in sports participation also has a moderate negative correlation with PSS change, but its overall impact may be outweighed by other factors.

Conversely, there is substantial evidence suggesting an improvement or stability in the participant's perceived stress. The significant decrease in both depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with a stable self-reported happiness score, strongly suggests a reduction in psychological distress. The substantial decrease in resting heart rate and Mesor, along with improved sleep duration, indicates positive physiological adaptations. The decrease in Intradaily Variability of heart rate also suggests a more regulated physiological state. The increase in health satisfaction, though modest, further supports a positive shift in well-being. While sleep start times have become less consistent, the overall increase in sleep duration is a positive indicator. The initial PSS score of 20.0 was below the population average (Z-score of -0.44), and the correlation of -0.56 with changes in PSS suggests that a lower initial score is associated with a tendency for PSS to decrease over time.

Holistically, the convergence of reduced self-reported distress, improved physiological regulation, and increased sleep duration points towards a general improvement or at least stabilization in the participant's perceived stress levels. The data indicate a trend towards reduced psychological and physiological strain, outweighing the minor negative changes observed in specific behavioral and sleep initiation metrics.

The participant exhibits a notable shift in several psychological and behavioral domains over the two-year period. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, have increased by 3 points, moving from a ""Not depressed"" classification to a higher score within the same classification. Similarly, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, has also increased by 3 points. In contrast, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, has shown a decrease of 3 points. Happiness, a self-reported metric, has improved by 1 point. Trust in others has slightly increased by 0.33 points. While Body Mass Index (BMI) has increased by 1.95 points, the participant remains within a healthy range.

In terms of behavioral habits, there has been an increase in beer consumption from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month."" Exercise habits show a mixed pattern: exercising alone has increased to ""Three times a week or more,"" while exercising with others has significantly decreased to ""Not at all."" Daily recreational activities reveal an increase in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" from ""Do not do"" to ""16-30 minutes"" per day. Conversely, ""Socializing with Friends"" has decreased from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes.""

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 2.2 beats per minute. The median sleep duration has decreased by 34 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep duration has notably increased by 67 minutes, indicating greater variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 46 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep start time has significantly increased by 81 minutes, suggesting a more erratic sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm metrics also indicate a shift, with the acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurring 15 minutes later in the day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has increased slightly, suggesting a larger daily variation in heart rate. Interdaily stability of heart rate has decreased slightly, while intradaily variability has increased, indicating a less predictable daily pattern in physiological activity.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Analysis of the provided data suggests a potential increase in perceived stress. The participant demonstrates an increase in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), alongside a decrease in self-esteem and a reduction in time spent socializing with friends. Furthermore, significant changes in sleep patterns, including decreased median sleep duration, increased sleep duration variability, and a later, more erratic sleep schedule, are strongly associated with elevated stress levels. The increase in resting heart rate and altered circadian rhythm metrics (decreased interdaily stability, increased intradaily variability) also point towards a heightened physiological stress response. Although there are some positive indicators, such as increased happiness and increased solitary exercise, the constellation of increased negative psychological symptoms, disrupted sleep, and physiological stress markers outweighs these improvements. The increase in beer consumption and decrease in social interaction further contribute to a pattern suggestive of increased stress.

The participant exhibits notable shifts in several behavioral and physiological metrics between the two data collection periods. Self-reported anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, have decreased by 3.0 points (Z-Score of Delta: -0.14), indicating a reduction in trait anxiety. Similarly, trust in interpersonal relationships has declined by 0.33 points (Z-Score of Delta: -0.93), moving from a relatively high score (1.47 Z-Score) to a more average level. While happiness scores remained stable, health satisfaction has seen a modest increase of 0.33 points (Z-Score of Delta: 0.26). Regarding lifestyle behaviors, there has been a substantial decrease in the time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies, shifting from an average of 1-2 hours to not engaging in this activity at all (Delta Num: -4.0, Z-Score of Delta: -2.74), which is a significant reduction. Conversely, engagement in sedentary hobbies has increased by an average of 1-2 hours (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.90). Exercise habits also show a mixed pattern; participation in 'Exercised Alone' has increased, moving from 'Not at all' to 'Less than 1-2 times a month' (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.91), while exercising with others and sports participation have both decreased in frequency.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has increased by 5.4 bpm (Z-Score of Delta: 1.18), moving from below average to above average relative to the study population. This increase in resting heart rate is accompanied by a rise in the Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of the heart rate circadian rhythm, which increased by 5.06 (Z-Score of Delta: 1.34). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has also increased by 1.51 (Z-Score of Delta: 0.51), suggesting a greater range of heart rate variation throughout the day. Conversely, the Intradaily Variability of the heart rate has decreased significantly by -0.19 (Z-Score of Delta: -1.57), indicating a more consolidated pattern of heart rate fluctuations within a 24-hour period. Sleep duration has slightly increased by 11 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.07), but the standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased substantially by 46 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: -1.0), suggesting more consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 23 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.4), and the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased considerably by 57 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 1.2), indicating greater variability in when sleep begins.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence suggesting a worsening of perceived stress includes a notable increase in resting heart rate (Delta: 5.4 bpm, Z-Score of Delta: 1.18) and an increase in the Mesor of the heart rate circadian rhythm (Delta: 5.06, Z-Score of Delta: 1.34). The increased Mesor suggests a higher average heart rate across the day, which can be indicative of heightened physiological arousal. Furthermore, a decrease in Intradaily Variability of heart rate (Delta: -0.19, Z-Score of Delta: -1.57) might imply a less dynamic cardiovascular response, potentially reflecting prolonged periods of lower-level activation, though this metric is less directly interpretable for stress without further context. The increase in the standard deviation of sleep start time by 57 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 1.2) also points towards disrupted sleep scheduling, a common correlate of stress. A decrease in trust (Delta: -0.33, Z-Score of Delta: -0.93) could also be a marker of increased stress, as interpersonal trust can be eroded under pressure.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is found in the significant decrease in self-reported anxiety (STAI Score Delta: -3.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.14) and a modest increase in health satisfaction (Score Delta: 0.33, Z-Score of Delta: 0.26). The reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D Score Delta: 0.0) and stable happiness scores (Score Delta: 0.0) suggest a stable emotional baseline. While engagement in sedentary hobbies has increased, the substantial decrease in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies is a positive behavioral shift. The slight increase in median sleep duration (Delta: 11 minutes) and a notable decrease in the variability of sleep duration (Delta: -46 minutes) are also positive indicators. The correlation between the change in PSS and the change in resting heart rate is low (-0.01), and the correlation with the change in Mesor is effectively zero, suggesting these physiological changes are not directly driven by fluctuations in perceived stress. The initial PSS score of 24.0 had a moderate negative correlation with the change in PSS (-0.56), indicating that individuals with higher initial stress tended to experience a reduction in stress over time. Given the mixed nature of the data, with some indicators pointing towards increased physiological arousal and sleep disruption, but counterbalanced by improvements in self-reported anxiety and sleep consistency, a definitive conclusion about the overall direction of perceived stress is nuanced. However, the increase in resting heart rate and Mesor, coupled with sleep schedule variability, suggest a leaning towards a more stressed state, despite improvements in some psychological self-report measures.

A negative correlation (r = -0.56) between the initial PSS score and subsequent changes suggests that higher initial stress may be associated with a decrease in stress over time.

**Self-Reported Psychological and Lifestyle Changes:**
A significant improvement is observed in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a decrease of 7.0 points on the CES-D scale (Z-Score of Delta: -0.64), moving from a classification of ""Depressed"" to ""Not depressed."" Trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, shows a minor reduction of 1.0 point, remaining in the ""not anxious"" classification (Z-Score of Delta: 0.11). Self-esteem experienced a slight decrease of 2.0 points (Z-Score of Delta: -0.35), moving towards the lower end of the scale. Health satisfaction declined by 1.33 points (Z-Score of Delta: -1.28), shifting from above average to below average relative to the population. Interpersonal trust increased by 0.5 points, with a Z-Score of Delta of 1.13, indicating a notable increase in trust. Happiness remained stable with a score of 3.0 (Z-Score of Delta: -0.13).

**Sleep Habits and Quality:**
Subjective sleep latency increased by 10.0 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.44), suggesting a longer time to fall asleep. However, the feeling of control over sleep duration decreased by 1.0 unit, moving from ""Somewhat Disagree"" to ""Disagree"" (Change Z-Score: -0.8), indicating a reduced sense of agency over sleep. Wearable data reveals an increase in median sleep duration by 22 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.28) and a substantial decrease in sleep duration variability by 49 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: -1.07), suggesting more consistent sleep duration. Median sleep start time shifted 12 minutes later (Z-Score of Delta: -0.27), and the variability of sleep start times decreased by 17 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: -0.32), indicating more regular sleep timing.

**Physiological and Circadian Rhythm Metrics:**
The participant's resting heart rate decreased by 3.6 bpm (Z-Score of Delta: -0.72), indicating improved cardiovascular health at rest. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm significantly increased by 3.74 (Z-Score of Delta: 1.26), suggesting a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, shifted approximately 49 minutes earlier, from 3:45 PM to 2:56 PM. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm decreased by 0.12 (Z-Score of Delta: -0.85), indicating less consistency in daily rhythm patterns. Intradaily variability increased by 0.11 (Z-Score of Delta: 0.56), suggesting more fluctuation within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours slightly decreased, indicating a weaker day-to-day predictability of the heart rate rhythm. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals generally higher average heart rates during waking hours in the current period compared to the previous, particularly between 8 AM and 6 PM, with peaks in the late afternoon.

**Behavioral Habits:**
No changes were reported in substance usage. Exercise habits show increased frequency of exercising with others (4 times a week or more), while exercising alone remained consistent. Sports participation decreased from less than 1-2 times a month to not at all. Daily recreational habits show increased internet usage (by 1 hour), and significantly increased time spent socializing with friends (by 2 hours). Time spent reading also increased by 15-30 minutes daily, and engagement in sedentary hobbies increased from none to 15 minutes or less. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games remained unchanged at none.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for a potential worsening of perceived stress can be inferred from the decrease in health satisfaction (Z-Score of Delta: -1.28) and the increase in subjective sleep latency (Z-Score of Delta: 0.44), along with a reduced feeling of control over sleep duration (Change Z-Score: -0.8). The earlier acrophase and increased amplitude of the heart rate rhythm, coupled with decreased interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability, may also suggest physiological dysregulation which can be linked to stress. Additionally, while overall sleep duration increased and became more stable, this is juxtaposed with the increased latency and reduced control.

Conversely, indicators of improved or stable stress levels are present. The significant reduction in depressive symptoms (Z-Score of Delta: -0.64) from a ""Depressed"" to ""Not depressed"" classification is a strong positive signal. Trait anxiety remained low, and self-esteem, though slightly decreased, stayed within a moderate range. The notable increase in interpersonal trust (Z-Score of Delta: 1.13) is another positive indicator. Furthermore, the decrease in resting heart rate (Z-Score of Delta: -0.72) suggests improved physiological well-being. The increase in socializing with friends and reading are also positive behavioral shifts. The initial negative correlation between PSS and change in PSS suggests a potential for stress reduction over time for individuals with higher initial stress.

Considering the mixed indicators, the significant reduction in depressive symptoms, increase in trust, and improved resting heart rate point towards potential stress reduction. While some indicators like health satisfaction, sleep latency, and certain circadian rhythm metrics suggest a potential for increased stress, the strong positive shifts in mental well-being (CES-D, Trust) and physiological markers (resting heart rate) are substantial. The increase in social interaction and reading are also positive coping mechanisms. Given the amelioration of depressive symptoms and increased trust, these suggest a more positive overall trajectory. Therefore, the evidence leans towards an improvement or stability in perceived stress.

25197,-7.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable decrease in subjective anxiety, as indicated by a significant reduction in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score, moving from 50.0 to 42.0. This is accompanied by a substantial increase in self-reported happiness, with the score rising from 3.0 to 5.0. Concurrently, there has been a positive shift in health satisfaction, with scores increasing from 6.44 to 6.78, along with a slight improvement in Body Mass Index (BMI) from 20.98 to 21.3. These positive self-reported psychological and health indicators are further supported by an increase in median sleep duration by 26 minutes, suggesting improved sleep quantity. However, the participant now reports feeling less in control over their sleep duration, shifting from ""Agree"" to ""Somewhat Agree,"" which may represent a point of concern in their sleep self-management.

Physiologically, there has been a significant reduction in the participant's resting heart rate, decreasing from 52.0 to 48.8. This decrease is accompanied by a reduction in the Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of their heart rate circadian rhythm, from 69.2 to 65.69, and a shift in the acrophase (peak time) earlier in the day, from 4:46 PM to 1:58 PM. While the Mesor reduction and earlier acrophase suggest a potential shift towards a more robust circadian rhythm with lower overall activity, the Intradaily Variability of heart rate has increased from 0.47 to 0.55, indicating greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The Interdaily Stability, a measure of rhythm regularity, has slightly decreased, suggesting a minor reduction in day-to-day consistency. In terms of behavioral habits, there has been a notable increase in exercising alone, with frequency rising from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Three times a week or more,"" and an increase in engaging in sports from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month."" This increased physical activity may contribute to the observed physiological changes.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The participant's perceived stress, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), is inferred to have remained stable or decreased. Several indicators suggest a reduction in psychological distress. The significant decrease in STAI scores (from 50.0 to 42.0) points to a reduction in trait anxiety. The substantial increase in self-reported happiness (from 3.0 to 5.0) further supports a positive shift in psychological well-being. Health satisfaction has also improved, and there is a slight positive change in BMI. The increase in median sleep duration by 26 minutes is a generally positive indicator for stress management, though the decreased feeling of control over sleep duration warrants consideration.

Physiologically, the reduction in resting heart rate from 52.0 to 48.8 is a notable improvement, indicating a potential decrease in physiological arousal. The decrease in the Mesor of the heart rate circadian rhythm from 69.2 to 65.69, coupled with an earlier acrophase, suggests a more regulated circadian system, potentially associated with lower stress. While intradaily variability has increased, indicating more fluctuation, the overall picture of reduced resting heart rate and a potentially more regulated circadian rhythm, alongside positive self-reported psychological changes, points towards a reduction or stabilization in perceived stress. The increase in exercise frequency, particularly exercising alone and engaging in sports, is also a positive behavioral adaptation that can mitigate stress. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and changes in PSS (-0.56) further suggests that higher initial stress may be associated with subsequent reductions in stress.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
23270,3.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms, with the STAI-Trait score decreasing from 47.0 (anxious) to 37.0 (not anxious), representing a Z-score of change of -1.04. Concurrently, depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, also showed a decrease from 11.0 to 9.0, though this change was less pronounced (Z-score of change of -0.09). Self-esteem experienced a modest increase, rising from 37.0 to 40.0 (Z-score of change of 0.58), aligning with a slight positive shift in interpersonal trust, which increased from 3.0 to 3.33 (Z-score of change of 0.72). Health satisfaction and self-reported happiness remained stable between the two measurement periods.

Behaviorally, the participant's sleep habits show some notable alterations. There was a substantial increase in sleep latency, extending from 20.0 minutes to 35.0 minutes (Z-score of change of 0.74), suggesting a longer time taken to fall asleep. This was accompanied by a decrease in the perceived control over sleep duration, moving from ""Strongly Agree"" to ""Agree"" (Z-score of change of -0.80). While the ideal sleep duration remained constant at 8.0 hours, the normal weekday sleep duration decreased by 1.0 hour (Z-score of change of -1.11), falling to 7.0 hours. This suggests a potential mismatch between desired and actual sleep, coupled with a decline in the subjective feeling of control over sleep. The participant also reported an increase in the frequency of consuming alcohol (wine or liquor) to 1-2 times a week, a shift from infrequent or no use, and a similar increase in beer consumption from ""Not at all"" to 1-2 times a month.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal some fluctuations. Interdaily stability of heart rate, a measure of daily rhythm regularity, significantly increased (Delta 0.17, Z-score of change 1.30), alongside a notable increase in the autocorrelation at 24 hours (Delta 0.27, Z-score of change 1.74). These metrics suggest a more consistent and structured daily cardiovascular rhythm. Conversely, intradaily variability, reflecting the fluctuation of heart rate within a day, decreased (Delta -0.09, Z-score of change -0.86). The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, shifted earlier from 3:36 PM to 2:13 PM. Resting heart rate slightly increased by 1.2 bpm (Z-score of change 0.30), but remained within a generally healthy range. The mesor, the overall average heart rate, decreased slightly (Delta -1.53, Z-score of change -0.10), while the amplitude, representing the range of heart rate variation, increased (Delta 1.71, Z-score of change 0.58). Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of elevated heart rates during typical waking hours, particularly between 7 AM and 6 PM, with peaks observed in the late morning and early evening across both time periods. While specific temporal trends within hourly data were not analyzed, the general pattern indicates periods of heightened physiological arousal during daytime activities.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress can be inferred from the observed increase in sleep latency and a decrease in the feeling of control over sleep duration. Furthermore, the participant's reported increase in alcohol consumption (wine or liquor, and beer) may also be indicative of elevated stress or coping mechanisms.

Conversely, evidence for the improvement or stability of perceived stress is more substantial. The significant decrease in self-reported anxiety (STAI-Trait) and the slight reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D) are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. The increase in self-esteem and interpersonal trust further supports a more positive psychological outlook. While sleep duration decreased, the median sleep start time shifted slightly earlier, and the overall stability and autocorrelation of the circadian rhythm improved, suggesting a potentially more regulated physiological system. The initial PSS score was within the average range for the study population (-0.71 Z-score), and the negative correlation (-0.56) between the initial PSS and its change over time suggests that a lower initial PSS was associated with a greater decrease in PSS.

Holistically, the marked reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with improvements in self-esteem and trust, and the evidence of a more stable circadian rhythm, outweigh the indicators of potential stress increase related to sleep latency and alcohol consumption. Therefore, the overall perceived stress score is likely to have decreased or remained stable.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
67177,-5.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant demonstrates several noteworthy shifts in self-reported psychological and behavioral metrics, alongside notable changes in wearable-derived physiological data, between the two assessment periods. The most significant self-report change involves an increase in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale, with a score delta of +4.0 and a corresponding positive Z-score of 0.58 for this change, suggesting a move towards a more clinically significant level of depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has increased substantially, with a delta of +2.0 and a notably high Z-score of 1.55 for this change, indicating a considerable increase in subjective well-being. While anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem (Rosenberg) scores remained relatively stable, the increase in CES-D coupled with the boost in happiness presents a complex picture of emotional state.

Behaviorally, there are indications of increased health-consciousness and potential stress-reduction activities. The participant has initiated exercising alone, moving from no reported activity to less than 1-2 times a month, represented by a frequency delta of +1.0 and a positive Z-score of 0.91. Additionally, there is a substantial increase in sedentary hobby engagement, with a delta of +4.0 and a strong Z-score of 1.93, indicating a significant shift towards more passive leisure activities. Internet usage has decreased by an average of 1 hour per day, with a delta of -1.0 and a Z-score of -0.79 for this change, and the participant has begun consuming alcohol (Wine or Liquor) at a rate of less than 1-2 times a month, a change from no prior reported usage. Sleep patterns reveal a slight decrease in average weekday sleep duration by 0.5 hours, with a positive Z-score of 0.41 for this delta, while perceived control over sleep duration remained subjectively unchanged.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a marked increase in resting heart rate, with a delta of +8.6 beats per minute and a substantial Z-score of 1.86, placing this change at the higher end of population variability. The Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of their heart rate rhythm has also increased, with a delta of 4.86 and a Z-score of 1.29, suggesting an elevated overall average heart rate throughout the day. This is accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm by -1.61 and a negative Z-score of -0.55, indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm has decreased slightly (-0.06, Z-score of -0.4), and intradaily variability has also decreased (-0.04, Z-score of -0.5), suggesting a less patterned and potentially more flattened daily heart rate response. The acrophase (peak of the rhythm) has shifted by approximately 3 minutes later. Median sleep duration has decreased by 22 minutes, with a negative Z-score of -0.6, and the median sleep start time has shifted approximately 42 minutes later, with a positive Z-score of 0.77 for this change, potentially reflecting later bedtimes.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is primarily indicated by the significant increase in the CES-D score, which rose by 4.0 points and is positively associated with changes in PSS score (correlation of 0.26). The increase in resting heart rate by 8.6 bpm, with a Z-score of 1.86, and the elevated Mesor of the heart rate rhythm (delta of 4.86, Z-score of 1.29) also suggest an underlying increase in physiological arousal, often linked to elevated stress. The decrease in median sleep duration by 22 minutes (Z-score of -0.6) further contributes to potential stress-related factors.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less direct. The substantial increase in self-reported happiness (delta of 2.0, Z-score of 1.55) could indicate improved well-being, though it contrasts with the CES-D findings. The initiation of exercising alone and the decrease in internet usage could be seen as positive lifestyle adjustments that might buffer stress. However, these positive behavioral changes are counterbalanced by an increase in sedentary hobbies. The self-esteem and anxiety scores remained stable, offering no clear indication of worsening stress in these domains.

Holistically, the increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and the physiological indicators of increased arousal (resting heart rate, Mesor) are strong signals of heightened stress. While subjective happiness has increased, this could represent a temporary emotional state or a compensatory mechanism rather than an overall reduction in underlying stress. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and changes in PSS score (-0.56) suggests that higher initial stress may predict subsequent decreases in stress, but this does not negate the current observed increase. The combination of elevated depressive symptomatology and increased physiological arousal, despite some positive behavioral shifts and an increase in happiness, suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress has likely increased.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
87328,3.0,"Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was notably low, with a Z-score of -1.8, suggesting a significantly lower stress level compared to the study population at baseline. This initial low stress level was moderately correlated with a decrease in PSS score over time (correlation of -0.56).

In terms of self-reported psychological states, the participant reported a notable increase in depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D scale. The current score of 8.0 (Z-score 1.02) represents an 8-point increase from the previous score of 0.0, moving from a significantly below-average Z-score to an above-average one. Concurrently, self-reported happiness decreased by 2.0 points, moving from an above-average Z-score of 1.64 to a below-average Z-score of -0.76. These changes have a moderate positive correlation with changes in PSS (CES-D delta correlation: 0.25, Happy delta correlation: -0.13), indicating that increases in depressive symptoms and decreases in happiness are associated with increases in perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem (SelfEsteem) remained relatively stable, with minimal changes and low correlations with PSS changes, suggesting these stable traits are not primary drivers of stress fluctuations for this participant. Interpersonal trust also remained stable. Health satisfaction experienced a decrease, moving from a Z-score of -1.2 to -1.97, a change that showed a slight negative correlation with PSS change.

Behaviorally, there have been significant shifts in sleep habits and daily activities. The participant reported a considerable reduction in sleep latency, decreasing by 30 minutes (Z-score of delta: -1.95), which is positively correlated with PSS change. However, the normal weekday sleep duration decreased by 1 hour (Z-score of delta: -1.11), and the feeling of control over sleep duration shifted from ""Agree"" to ""Disagree"" (Z-score of delta: -2.59). Both of these changes have a negative correlation with PSS change, suggesting that shorter sleep durations and reduced perceived control over sleep are associated with lower perceived stress.

Exercise patterns show mixed results. There was an increase in exercising alone (1 episode per week, Z-score of delta: 0.91), but a decrease in exercising with others and a significant reduction in sports participation, moving from 1-2 times a week to not at all (Z-score of delta: -1.85). The decrease in sports participation showed a very small positive correlation with PSS change. Substance usage remained at ""Not at all"" across all categories.

Daily recreation habits show a substantial decrease in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (by 2 hours, Z-score of delta: -1.46), listening to music (by 2 hours, Z-score of delta: -1.06), and socializing with friends (by 3 hours, Z-score of delta: -2.11). Additionally, time spent reading decreased significantly (by 20 minutes, Z-score of delta: -1.82). These reductions in leisure and social activities have a slightly negative correlation with PSS change, suggesting that spending less time on these activities is associated with lower perceived stress.

Physiologically, as measured by the wearable, there are notable changes in circadian rhythm and heart rate patterns. Interdaily stability of heart rate decreased significantly (by -0.21, Z-score of delta: -1.51), and intradaily variability increased substantially (by 0.43, Z-score of delta: 2.83), with the latter showing a slight positive correlation with PSS change. Autocorrelation at 24 hours also decreased (by -0.22, Z-score of delta: -1.59). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm decreased by 7.71 (Z-score of delta: -2.61), a change that has a small positive correlation with PSS. The MESOR remained relatively stable. The resting heart rate increased by 8.4 bpm (Z-score of delta: 1.82), moving from below average to above average, and this increase has a small negative correlation with PSS change. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general decrease in heart rate across most hours of the day compared to the previous period, with notable reductions in the late evening and overnight hours. For instance, the 6-7 PM hour saw a significant drop from 99.27 to 85.77, and the 10-11 PM hour decreased from 94.43 to 88.81. However, the peak heart rates in the evening (e.g., 8-9 PM) have slightly increased.

Sleep duration, as recorded by the wearable, decreased by 31 minutes (Z-score of delta: -0.78), moving from above average to below average. The standard deviation of sleep duration also increased slightly. Median sleep start time and its standard deviation remained relatively stable.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress (increase) is present in the increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and the decrease in self-reported happiness. The significant increase in resting heart rate, accompanied by a decrease in sleep duration and control over sleep, also suggests a potential increase in physiological strain. The increase in intradaily variability of heart rate and a decrease in circadian amplitude further support a potential increase in physiological dysregulation, which can be associated with heightened stress. The negative correlations of increased depressive symptoms and decreased happiness with PSS changes support this direction.

Evidence for an improvement or stability of perceived stress (decrease/stable) is indicated by the reduced sleep latency, which positively correlates with PSS change. Furthermore, substantial reductions in time spent on passive leisure activities like watching TV, listening to music, and notably, socializing with friends, are negatively correlated with PSS change. The decrease in Body Mass Index, although not directly linked to stress measures in this data, may indicate a healthier lifestyle. The initial low PSS score and its correlation with a decrease over time also point towards a potential for stress reduction. The reduction in average heart rate during many parts of the day might also suggest a potential for reduced physiological arousal.

Holistically, the increase in reported depressive symptoms and decrease in happiness, coupled with physiological indicators of increased strain (higher resting heart rate, increased heart rate variability, reduced circadian amplitude) and reduced perceived control over sleep, outweigh the observed reductions in passive leisure activities and the initial low stress score. While some behaviors suggest a move towards less sedentary lifestyles, the psychological and physiological indicators lean towards an overall increase in perceived stress.

33785,3.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological and behavioral data reveal several notable changes between the two assessment periods. Self-reported measures indicate a significant increase in both depressive symptoms (CES-D score delta of 6.0, Z-score of delta 0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI score delta of 7.0, Z-score of delta 1.14). Conversely, self-esteem has decreased substantially, with a score delta of -8.0 and a Z-score of delta -1.46, suggesting a decline in self-worth. Happiness also appears to have decreased, indicated by a score delta of -1.0 and a Z-score of delta -0.96. Health satisfaction has markedly worsened, evidenced by a significant score delta of -2.78 and a Z-score of delta -2.62.

Behaviorally, there have been shifts in daily habits. While exercise frequency remains stable, there is a notable increase in the duration of sedentary activities, specifically watching TV/videos/movies (delta of 2.0 hours) and playing video games (delta of 3.0 hours). Internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading have also increased in duration. Alcohol consumption (beer) has also increased, shifting from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (delta of 1.0 on the numerical scale).

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, there are indications of reduced rhythmicity and stability. Interdaily stability of heart rate has decreased (delta of -0.22, Z-score of delta -1.59), and intradaily variability has increased (delta of 0.14, Z-score of delta 0.77), suggesting a less structured daily physiological pattern. The mesor, a measure of average daily heart rate, has decreased (delta of -6.83, Z-score of delta -1.26), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has also reduced (delta of -3.16, Z-score of delta -1.07). The resting heart rate has also decreased by 5.2 beats per minute (Z-score of delta -1.06). Sleep patterns show an increase in total sleep duration (delta of 0 hours 58 minutes, Z-score of delta 0.99) and a later median sleep start time (delta of 0 hours 26 minutes, Z-score of delta -0.52). The standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased, indicating more consistent sleep duration, but the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased, suggesting greater variability in when sleep begins.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is substantial, primarily driven by significant increases in self-reported trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with a marked decline in self-esteem and happiness. The concurrent decrease in health satisfaction further suggests a negative shift in the participant's overall well-being. While some physiological metrics indicate a reduction in stress (e.g., lower resting heart rate and mesor), these are accompanied by a decrease in circadian rhythm regularity, which can be indicative of dysregulation. The increase in sedentary activities and alcohol consumption, along with increased variability in sleep start times, may also contribute to heightened stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less compelling. While sleep duration has increased and the standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased, suggesting potential improvements in sleep quality, the later and more variable sleep start times may offset these benefits. The decrease in the mesor and amplitude of heart rate, while potentially reflecting reduced physiological strain, also suggests a less robust circadian rhythm, which can be associated with stress.

Considering the holistic pattern of changes, the pronounced increases in negative psychological indicators (anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, unhappiness) and the shift towards more sedentary lifestyle choices strongly suggest an overall increase in perceived stress. The negative correlations between changes in STAI and CES-D with changes in PSS (though not explicitly provided for PSS, the trends in these anxiety and depression measures are highly relevant) and the negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS (-0.56) suggest that individuals starting with higher stress may experience greater increases. However, given the clear increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms, it is most probable that perceived stress has worsened.

33009,2.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's psychological and behavioral landscape has undergone notable shifts over the two-year period. Self-reported measures indicate a significant reduction in trait anxiety, with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score decreasing from 40.0 to 28.0 (Z-score delta of -1.3), moving from the ""anxious"" to the ""not anxious"" classification. This is complemented by a notable increase in self-esteem, with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) score rising from 40.0 to 50.0 (Z-score delta of 1.87). Happiness also saw a marked improvement, increasing from a score of 3.0 to 5.0 (Z-score delta of 1.55). Conversely, depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, decreased from 9.0 to 4.0 (Z-score delta of -0.42), indicating a reduction in the frequency of depressive symptoms. Trust levels also increased slightly from 3.0 to 3.5 (Z-score delta of 1.13). Health satisfaction demonstrated a modest increase, moving from 3.67 to 4.22 (Z-score delta of 0.46).

In terms of behavioral habits, there have been shifts in substance usage. Wine or liquor consumption has increased from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""three times a week or more"" (delta of 1.0 on a numerical scale). Beer consumption has decreased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""less than 1-2 times a month"" (delta of -1.0). Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug usage remained at ""Not at all."" Exercise habits remained consistent, with ""Exercised Alone"" and ""Exercised with Others"" both reported as ""1-2 times a week."" However, participation in ""Sports"" has decreased significantly from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all"" (delta of -2.0). Daily recreational habits show a slight increase in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""16-30 minutes"" (delta of 1.0). Other daily recreational activities such as Video Games, Internet Usage, Listening to Music, Socializing with Friends, Reading, and Sedentary Hobbies remained largely unchanged in their reported duration or frequency.

Sleep patterns exhibit some changes. The self-reported ""Feeling of being in control over sleep duration"" shifted from ""Somewhat Disagree"" to ""Agree"" (delta of 3.0), suggesting increased perceived control. However, the ""Ideal Weekday Sleep Time"" desired by the participant decreased by 1.0 hour (delta of -0.7), and the ""Normal Weekday Sleep Duration"" also decreased by 1.0 hour (delta of -1.11), moving from 7.0 to 6.0 hours, which is now below the population average. Sleep latency reduced from 10.0 minutes to 5.0 minutes (delta of -0.46), indicating falling asleep more quickly. Wearable-derived sleep duration also decreased by 1 hour and 2 minutes (delta of -1.38), falling below population norms. The median sleep start time shifted later by 36 minutes (delta of 0.65).

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data show significant alterations. The participant's resting heart rate increased by 6.15 bpm (Z-score delta of 1.34), moving from below to above the population average. The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate rhythm, also increased substantially by 7.84 bpm (Z-score delta of 1.94), also moving from below to above population norms. The Acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, shifted later from 4:02 PM to 5:43 PM. Interdaily stability, a measure of daily rhythm regularity, decreased slightly from 0.39 to 0.31 (Z-score delta of -0.55), indicating a minor reduction in the consistency of daily activity patterns. Intradaily variability remained largely stable, with a negligible decrease of -0.01. The Amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation within the circadian cycle, decreased slightly. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal a notable pattern of elevated heart rates across most hours of the day in the current period compared to the previous one. Specifically, hours between 9 AM and 11 PM generally exhibit higher mean heart rates, with pronounced increases observed during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 4-6 PM, 8-11 PM).

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Analysis of the provided data reveals several indicators that suggest an increase in the participant's perceived stress. The most direct indicators include the substantial increase in resting heart rate and Mesor, suggesting heightened physiological arousal and a potential shift towards a more stressed baseline. The later Acrophase also implies a disruption in circadian timing, which can be associated with stress. Furthermore, the decrease in normal weekday sleep duration and median sleep duration, coupled with a later sleep start time, points towards potential sleep disturbances, a known correlate of increased stress. While self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, and happiness show improvement, these are subjective and can sometimes mask underlying physiological stress responses. The increase in wine or liquor consumption, even with a decrease in beer, also warrants consideration as a potential coping mechanism for stress. The decrease in sports participation could also contribute to reduced stress coping mechanisms. The correlation between the initial PSS score and its change is -0.56, suggesting that a lower initial PSS score was associated with a greater increase in PSS over time. Considering the physiological evidence of increased arousal and potential sleep disruption, alongside a potentially maladaptive shift in substance use, the overall direction of change in perceived stress appears to be an increase.

22913,1.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits notable changes across several psychological and behavioral domains, with a significant increase in reported depressive and anxious symptomatology. The CES-D score has increased substantially from 0.0 to 29.0 (Z-score of delta = 3.34), shifting from a non-depressed to a depressed classification, correlating positively with changes in perceived stress (0.25). Similarly, the STAI-Trait score has risen from 34.0 to 50.0 (Z-score of delta = 2.3), moving from a not anxious to an anxious classification, with a moderate positive correlation (0.19) to changes in perceived stress. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has also increased from 3.0 to 5.0 (Z-score of delta = 1.55), showing a negative correlation (-0.14) with changes in perceived stress, suggesting that while self-reported happiness has improved, it has not offset the increase in negative affect.

Lifestyle behaviors indicate a shift towards increased consumption of alcohol, specifically beer, with usage rising from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Three times a week or more"" (Delta Num = 1.0, Z-score of delta = 0.7). Conversely, the usage of wine or liquor has decreased from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num = -2.0, Z-score of delta = -2.24), and recreational drug use has increased from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num = 1.0, Z-score of delta = 1.97). Physical activity has significantly decreased, with both ""Exercised Alone"" and ""Exercised with Others"" shifting from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all"" (Delta Num = -2.0 for both, with Z-scores of delta -1.65 and -1.15 respectively). In terms of daily recreational habits, there is an increase in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (Delta Num = 2.0, Z-score of delta = 1.1) and ""Reading"" (Delta Num = 3.0, Z-score of delta = 2.21), with a notable increase in ""Sedentary Hobby"" time from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""more than 4 hours"" (Delta Num = 4.0, Z-score of delta = 1.93).

Physiological data reveals a significant increase in the regularity and robustness of the participant's circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability has increased from 0.36 to 0.64 (Z-score of delta = 2.11), indicating a more consistent daily pattern. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has also improved from 0.23 to 0.37 (Z-score of delta = 0.86), further suggesting enhanced daily rhythmicity. While Intradaily Variability shows a slight increase (Delta = 0.05, Z-score of delta = 0.13), it remains within a less variable range. The Acrophase has shifted slightly earlier, from 5:12 PM to 4:54 PM. The Mesor, representing the midpoint of the heart rate rhythm, has decreased from 89.08 to 83.01 (Z-score of delta = -1.09), which, when considered alongside a lower resting heart rate (64.45 vs 66.3), may suggest a more regulated physiological state. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased from 10.78 to 13.58 (Z-score of delta = 0.94), indicating a greater variation between peak and trough heart rates within the daily cycle. Sleep duration has remained relatively stable, with a median of 8 hours and 28 minutes. However, sleep start time has shifted approximately 16 minutes earlier (Delta = 0 hours 16 minutes, Z-score of delta = -0.35), and the variability in sleep start time has decreased significantly (Delta = -49 minutes, Z-score of delta = -0.96).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is strongly indicated by the significant increases in self-reported depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI-Trait) scores, both of which have moved into clinically relevant ranges and show positive correlations with changes in PSS. This elevation in negative affect, despite an increase in self-reported happiness, suggests a more complex interplay of psychological states. The observed decrease in physical activity, including exercising alone and with others, coupled with a substantial increase in time spent on sedentary hobbies and passive entertainment like watching TV, points towards behaviors that can contribute to increased stress.

Evidence for the improvement or stability of perceived stress is less pronounced. While self-reported happiness has increased, this appears to be overshadowed by the rise in negative affect. Sleep duration has remained stable, and the reduction in the variability of sleep start times could be indicative of some positive adaptation in sleep regularity. The improved Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours in heart rate data suggest a more regular daily rhythm, which could be a buffer against stress. The decrease in Mesor and resting heart rate could also indicate a reduction in basal physiological arousal.

However, the primary indicators of perceived stress, namely the CES-D and STAI scores, have shown substantial increases. The correlation analysis also suggests that some of the observed behavioral changes, such as the increase in beer consumption and decrease in physical activity, are associated with increases in perceived stress, albeit with small correlation magnitudes. Given the significant elevations in both depressive and anxious symptomatology, which are direct correlates of perceived stress, the overall direction of change indicates a worsening of the participant's perceived stress.

48969,-2.0,"Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant has exhibited notable shifts in psychological and behavioral indicators over the two-year period. Self-reported measures indicate a significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a decrease of 11.0 points on the CES-D scale, accompanied by a Z-score change of -1.08. Similarly, anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has decreased by 7.0 points, with a Z-score change of -0.66. Concurrently, self-esteem has improved by 9.0 points, reaching a Z-score of -0.98, a substantial increase from the previous -2.28. These positive trends in mood and self-perception are further supported by an increase in self-reported happiness by 2.0 points (Z-score change of 1.55). However, health satisfaction has declined by 1.33 points (Z-score change of -1.28). Regarding sleep, the participant now reports a longer desired weekday sleep duration (-8.0 hours, Z-score change of -6.12), and their normal weekday sleep duration has increased by 1.0 hour (Z-score change of 0.92). Notably, sleep latency has significantly increased by 90.0 minutes (Z-score change of 5.22), and the feeling of control over sleep duration has improved from ""Strongly Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Disagree"" (a change of 2.0, with a Z-score change of 0.98).

Behavioral habits show mixed patterns. While substance usage remains minimal with no change, sports participation has decreased, with a reduction of 1.0 instance per month (Z-score change of -0.47). There has been a notable decrease in time spent playing video games, dropping from over 4 hours to 31 minutes an hour (a reduction of 4.0 hours, with a Z-score change of -2.99). Conversely, time spent socializing with friends has increased substantially, from 15 minutes or less to 1-2 hours (an increase of 3.0 hours, with a Z-score change of 2.18). Time spent reading has also increased from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (an increase of 1.0 hour, with a Z-score change of 0.6). Sedentary hobby time has increased from ""Do not do"" to 1-2 hours (an increase of 4.0 hours, with a Z-score change of 1.93).

Physiological data from wearables reveal a significant decrease in resting heart rate by 11.2 bpm (Z-score change of -2.33), moving from 71.6 bpm to 60.4 bpm. This is accompanied by a reduction in the Mesor (mean heart rate) by 9.7 bpm (Z-score change of -1.88), indicating a general lowering of baseline cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm, however, has increased by 3.97 (Z-score change of 1.34), suggesting a greater diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. Interdaily stability of heart rate has slightly increased by 0.04 (Z-score change of 0.34), while intradaily variability has decreased by 0.04 (Z-score change of -0.5), suggesting a more consistent daily pattern. The median sleep duration has increased by approximately 1 hour and 6 minutes (Z-score change of 1.16), but the median sleep start time has shifted later by 1 hour and 22 minutes (Z-score change of 1.52). The standard deviation of sleep start time has decreased significantly by 64 minutes (Z-score change of -1.26), indicating more regularity in when sleep begins. The standard deviation of sleep duration has also decreased by 33 minutes (Z-score change of -0.69), suggesting more consistent sleep durations.

The hourly aggregated heart rate data reveals a general decrease in heart rate across most hours of the day compared to the previous period. Most notably, the hours between 8 AM and 6 PM previously showed elevated heart rates, with peaks exceeding 80 bpm. In the current period, these peak hours are significantly lower, with the highest recorded hourly mean heart rate around 88 bpm between 1-2 PM, compared to previous peaks reaching over 90 bpm. The early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM) also show a reduction in heart rate, with the lowest point in the current data at 59.9 bpm (5-6 AM) compared to 69.44 bpm in the previous period. This reduction in heart rate throughout the day, particularly during previously higher activity periods, aligns with the decrease in resting heart rate.

The participant's psychological and behavioral data reveal several notable changes between the two assessment periods. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, have increased (Delta: 4.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.58), shifting from a ""Not depressed"" classification to a higher symptom burden, although still within the ""Not depressed"" range. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has significantly decreased (Delta: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.8), moving from a score of 5 to 3. This trend is further underscored by a decrease in self-esteem (Delta: -4.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.72). Conversely, the participant's health satisfaction has notably improved (Delta: 1.78, Z-Score of Delta: 1.59). In terms of lifestyle behaviors, there has been a substantial increase in the reported frequency of beer consumption (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.62) and wine/liquor consumption (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.72). Physical activity has also seen marked increases, with exercising alone now occurring three times a week or more (Delta Num: 4.0, Z-Score of Delta: 3.48) and sports participation increasing to 1-2 times a week (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.28). Recreational activities like watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music have also seen a modest increase in duration. Notably, video game usage has ceased, and sedentary hobby time has decreased.

Physiological data from the Fitbit indicate a general trend towards increased sleep duration and a later sleep start time. The median sleep duration has increased by 42 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.68), and the median sleep start time has shifted approximately 1 hour and 11 minutes later (Z-Score of Delta: -1.38). The regularity of the participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, has decreased (Delta: -0.14, Z-Score of Delta: -0.99), suggesting a less consistent daily pattern. This is accompanied by a decrease in the Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Delta: -5.52, Z-Score of Delta: -1.87), implying a reduced daily variation in heart rate. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, has also decreased (Delta: -4.84, Z-Score of Delta: -0.82), aligning with a lower resting heart rate, which remained stable. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a shift in the timing of higher heart rate periods, with peak hours generally occurring later in the day and at night compared to the previous assessment. For instance, the 8-9 PM hour has seen a decrease in average heart rate, while the 3-4 PM hour has seen a notable increase. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier from 5:03 PM to 4:00 PM.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is suggested by the self-reported increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and the significant decrease in self-reported happiness. While the STAI-Trait score remained stable, the decline in self-esteem could also contribute to heightened stress. On the other hand, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is suggested by the substantial increase in health satisfaction and the significant increase in engagement with physical activities and sports. The increase in sleep duration, although accompanied by a later start time and reduced regularity of the circadian rhythm, could be interpreted as an attempt to manage stress or improve well-being. The decrease in the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm and the lower average heart rate (Mesor) might indicate a physiological reduction in overall arousal, which could be indicative of reduced stress. However, the increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in happiness are strong indicators of worsening psychological well-being, which are closely linked to perceived stress. The negative correlation between initial PSS and the change in PSS (-0.56) suggests that individuals with lower initial PSS scores tended to experience an increase in stress. Considering the significant increases in negative affective states (depressive symptoms, unhappiness) and the concurrent increases in health-promoting behaviors and decreases in some sedentary habits, the overall picture is complex. However, the reported increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in happiness, which are direct indicators of negative psychological states associated with stress, appear to outweigh the positive indicators of physical health and activity engagement in determining the overall direction of perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported psychological state shows some notable shifts. Notably, happiness has decreased (Delta of -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.96), moving from a higher score to a lower one, while the CES-D score has increased (Delta of 4.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.58), indicating a slight increase in depressive symptoms, though still classified as ""Not depressed."" Trait anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem (Rosenberg) have remained stable, with no change in their scores. Interpersonal trust has slightly increased (Delta of 0.17, Z-Score of Delta: 0.31). Health satisfaction has significantly improved (Delta of 1.44, Z-Score of Delta: 1.28), moving from a below-average to an above-average score.

Behaviorally, there have been significant changes in substance usage and exercise habits. Beer consumption has increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.66). Wine or liquor consumption has also increased from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.72). Exercise frequency, particularly with others, has dramatically increased, from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""Three times a week or more"" (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.42), and exercising alone has also increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.91). Sports engagement remains stable. Significant increases in daily recreational activities are also observed, most notably in listening to music (Delta Num: 5.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.62) and a moderate increase in socializing with friends (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.75). Internet usage and sedentary hobbies remain unchanged.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, has decreased (Delta of -0.09, Z-Score of Delta: -0.63), suggesting a less consistent daily pattern. Conversely, Intradaily Variability has increased (Delta of 0.17, Z-Score of Delta: 0.99), implying more fluctuations within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has decreased (Delta of -0.2, Z-Score of Delta: -1.45), further supporting a reduced regularity in the diurnal heart rate rhythm. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, has slightly decreased (Delta of -2.89, Z-Score of Delta: -0.4), and the Amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation, has increased (Delta of 1.05, Z-Score of Delta: 0.35). The resting heart rate has significantly decreased (Delta of -7.2, Z-Score of Delta: -1.48), moving from above average to below average. Sleep duration has increased by 30 minutes (Delta: 0.45), with a notable increase in the standard deviation of sleep duration (Delta: 28 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: 0.78), suggesting more variability in nightly sleep. The median sleep start time has shifted earlier by 36 minutes (Delta: -0.72), while the standard deviation of sleep start time has increased by 11 minutes (Delta: 0.26), indicating a more variable sleep schedule.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The analysis of the provided data reveals a complex interplay of changes in the participant's psychological state, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics, which collectively inform the assessment of perceived stress.

Evidence for potential worsening of perceived stress includes a decrease in self-reported happiness and a slight increase in depressive symptoms, though these remain within non-clinical ranges. The significant increase in alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor) could be a coping mechanism indicative of heightened stress. Furthermore, the decrease in circadian rhythm regularity (lower Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours, higher Intradaily Variability) suggests a disruption in the participant's internal biological timing, which is often associated with increased stress and poorer well-being.

Conversely, several factors suggest potential improvement or stability in perceived stress. The significant increase in health satisfaction is a positive indicator. While trait anxiety remained stable, the improvement in health satisfaction could contribute to overall well-being. The dramatic increase in exercise frequency, particularly with others, and increased social engagement are strong protective factors against stress. The reduction in resting heart rate, while potentially reflecting improved fitness, could also indicate a decrease in physiological arousal related to stress. The increase in median sleep duration, though accompanied by increased variability, could be a positive adaptation if the total duration is sufficient for recovery. The earlier median sleep start time, despite increased variability, might reflect an attempt to establish a more structured sleep routine.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's engagement in significantly increased physical activity and social interaction, coupled with improved health satisfaction, are strong counterbalances to the negative indicators of reduced happiness, increased alcohol consumption, and disrupted circadian rhythms. The decrease in resting heart rate is also a positive physiological sign. While there are clear indicators of increased stress in some domains, the robust increase in positive health behaviors and the significant improvement in health satisfaction suggest that the participant may be adapting to or mitigating potential stressors. The correlation between the initial PSS score and changes, -0.56, indicates that higher initial PSS scores were associated with a decrease in PSS score over time, suggesting a tendency for improvement. Given the substantial increase in positive coping behaviors and improved health satisfaction, the overall trajectory points towards a stable or decreasing perceived stress level.

The participant's self-reported well-being and behavioral patterns exhibit several notable shifts between the two data collection periods. While measures of depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) have shown slight increases, they remain within the ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" classifications, respectively, and are not considered substantial changes. Conversely, self-esteem has marginally decreased, though it remains at a relatively high level. In terms of lifestyle behaviors, there has been a notable decrease in the reported normal weekday sleep duration, dropping by an average of 0.5 hours to 4.5 hours, and a corresponding increase in sleep latency by 2.0 minutes. This suggests a potential decline in sleep quality or efficiency. Regarding physical activity, exercise with others has ceased entirely from an occasional engagement (1-2 times a month) to ""Not at all,"" while exercising alone has been maintained. Notably, internet usage has decreased from ""31 minutes to an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes.""

Physiological data from wearable devices indicates a significant reduction in the participant's resting heart rate, decreasing by 7.8 beats per minute from 68.4 bpm to 60.6 bpm. This is a substantial decrease, particularly considering the participant's initial Z-score for resting heart rate was moderately high (1.17). Simultaneously, the Mesor (Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm), which represents the central tendency of heart rate over a 24-hour period, has decreased by 4.78, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased by 2.02. The acrophase (peak time of heart rate) has shifted earlier in the day. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity, specifically Interdaily Stability, have improved (increased by 0.08), suggesting a more consistent daily pattern of heart rate variation. Intradaily Variability has also increased (by 0.16), which, in conjunction with the increased amplitude, might reflect greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The median sleep duration has increased by 36 minutes to 5 hours and 42 minutes, and the median sleep start time has shifted earlier by over an hour.

The initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was 19.0, which is below the population average (Z-score of -0.71). This suggests a relatively lower baseline level of perceived stress. The correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS over time was -0.56, indicating that individuals with lower initial PSS scores tended to experience a greater increase in perceived stress over the study period.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence suggesting a worsening of perceived stress includes a modest increase in both depressive (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) symptoms, as well as a decrease in self-esteem. Additionally, self-reported sleep duration has decreased, and sleep latency has increased, which are often associated with elevated stress levels. The decrease in exercise with others could also be a contributing factor.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. The decrease in resting heart rate and the shift in the Mesor and Acrophase of the circadian rhythm suggest positive physiological adaptations. The improvement in Interdaily Stability of heart rate indicates a more regular daily rhythm. The increase in median sleep duration and earlier sleep onset, while sleep latency has increased, could represent an effort to gain more sleep, even if not entirely efficient.

Considering the overall pattern, the combination of decreased self-esteem, increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep duration, despite some positive physiological indicators, points towards an overall worsening of the participant's perceived stress. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS suggests that participants starting with lower stress levels were more likely to experience an increase, which aligns with the observed changes in this participant.

The participant's self-reported psychological state has shown notable shifts across several domains. The CES-D scale, measuring depressive symptoms, has significantly increased (Delta: 15.0, Z-Score of Delta: 1.79), moving from a mild level of depressive symptoms to a more pronounced one. Concurrently, anxiety as measured by the STAI has also seen a slight increase (Delta: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.63), moving from a moderately anxious state to a higher level within that range. In contrast, self-esteem has experienced a substantial decrease (Delta: -16.0, Z-Score of Delta: -2.94), falling from a positive score to a significantly low one, indicating a marked decline in self-worth. Interpersonal trust has also decreased (Delta: -1.17, Z-Score of Delta: -2.99), indicating a shift towards lower trust in others. Happiness, however, remained stable (Delta: 0.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.13).

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant's sleep patterns indicate a deterioration in sleep control and a reduction in typical sleep duration. Self-reported 'Feeling of being in control over sleep duration' has increased significantly in its positive direction (Delta: 4.0, Change Z-Score: 2.18), suggesting a greater perceived sense of agency over sleep, yet this is juxtaposed with a decrease in 'Normal Weekday Sleep Duration' (Delta: -1.0 hours, Z-Score of Delta: -1.11) and an increase in 'Sleep Latency' (Delta: 5.0 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: 0.14). The desired sleep duration has increased by one hour (Delta: 1.0 hours, Z-Score of Delta: 0.85). Substance usage has seen an increase in the frequency of wine or liquor consumption (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.73) and the initiation of recreational and non-prescribed drug use, both moving from 'Not at all' to 'Less than 1-2 times a month' (Delta Num for both: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta for both: 1.97 and 2.36 respectively). Physical activity shows a decrease in exercising with others (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.43) but an increase in engaging in sports (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.91). Daily recreational habits reveal a significant increase in time spent playing video games (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.64) and a notable increase in sedentary hobbies (Delta Num: 2.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.9). Conversely, there's a decrease in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.82) and internet usage (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.79). Notably, time dedicated to reading has increased substantially from none to 31 minutes an hour (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.21).

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data indicate a mixed pattern. The resting heart rate has decreased (Delta: -5.7, Z-Score of Delta: -1.17), suggesting an improvement in cardiovascular efficiency. Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, has improved (Delta: 0.07, Z-Score of Delta: 0.56), suggesting a more consistent daily rhythm. However, Intradaily Variability has slightly decreased (Delta: -0.02, Z-Score of Delta: -0.36), which, in isolation, could suggest less fluctuation within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has significantly increased (Delta: 0.23, Z-Score of Delta: 1.47), indicating a stronger day-to-day predictability in heart rate patterns. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, has decreased (Delta: -3.37, Z-Score of Delta: -0.5), which, in conjunction with the decreased resting heart rate, suggests lower overall physiological arousal. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased (Delta: 4.09, Z-Score of Delta: 1.38), indicating a larger daily fluctuation between peak and trough heart rate. Sleep duration, as measured by median sleep duration, has slightly increased (Delta: 10 minutes, Z-Score of Delta: 0.04), although the standard deviation of sleep duration remained stable. The median sleep start time has shifted later by approximately one hour (Delta: 1 hour, Z-Score of Delta: 1.11). Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced increase in heart rate during the evening hours, particularly between 6 PM and 10 PM, with peaks around 90-100 bpm, compared to the prior period. This contrasts with a decrease in heart rate during the early morning hours.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The evidence points towards a worsening of the participant's perceived stress. The significant increase in CES-D scores, indicating a rise in depressive symptoms, and the increase in STAI scores, signifying heightened anxiety, are strong indicators of increased psychological distress. This is further corroborated by a substantial decline in self-esteem and a decrease in interpersonal trust, which often correlate with higher stress levels. While the resting heart rate has decreased and Interdaily Stability has improved, suggesting some physiological improvements, these are overshadowed by other indicators. The increase in amplitude of the circadian rhythm and the pronounced elevation in heart rate during evening hours suggest a disruption in physiological regulation and potential heightened arousal during specific parts of the day. The shift towards later sleep onset, despite a slight increase in median sleep duration, may also contribute to sleep quality issues. Furthermore, the increase in substance use, including recreational and non-prescribed drugs, and the substantial increase in sedentary hobbies and video game usage, alongside a decrease in social interactions with friends, suggest maladaptive coping mechanisms that can exacerbate stress. The initial PSS score was close to the population average, and its correlation with changes suggests that initial stress levels were not a strong predictor of change. However, the constellation of increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, decreased self-esteem and trust, alongside concerning shifts in sleep and increased engagement in potentially stressful or unhelpful behaviors, strongly indicates an overall increase in perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported psychological state shows some shifts between the two measurement periods. Notably, the CES-D score has increased from 3.0 to 7.0, indicating a greater frequency of depressive symptoms, although remaining within the ""Not depressed"" classification. The STAI-Trait anxiety score has also increased by 3 points, from 28.0 to 31.0, though it also remains within the ""not anxious"" classification. Conversely, self-reported happiness has decreased significantly from 5.0 to 3.0, with a corresponding substantial negative Z-score of delta, suggesting a decline in subjective well-being. Health satisfaction has also decreased from a notably high previous score of 5.78 to 4.44. Trust levels have seen a marginal increase.

In terms of behavioral habits, a significant increase in desired weekday sleep duration is observed, from 7.0 to 8.0 hours, aligning with a higher reported normal weekday sleep duration of 8.0 hours compared to the previous 6.0 hours. This suggests an increased perceived need for, and perhaps actual attainment of, longer sleep. The feeling of control over sleep duration has also improved. Substance usage for wine or liquor has increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month."" Notably, exercise alone has decreased significantly in frequency, shifting from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" while exercise with others and participation in sports remained unchanged. Daily recreational habits show an increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, both moving from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less."" Socializing with friends has also increased in reported time duration. Conversely, listening to music has decreased in duration.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits several changes. Resting heart rate has increased from 67.2 bpm to 71.6 bpm, a change that is above the population average. The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of the heart rate rhythm, has slightly increased, while the Amplitude, representing the daily variation in heart rate, has also increased. The Acrophase, the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, has shifted later in the day. Interdaily stability, a measure of the regularity of the circadian rhythm, has increased, suggesting a more consistent daily pattern. Conversely, intradaily variability has decreased, indicating less fluctuation in heart rate within a day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has also increased, further supporting a more stable daily rhythm. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a general increase in heart rate across most hours of the day compared to the previous measurement period, particularly during evening and nighttime hours. Sleep statistics indicate a substantial increase in median sleep duration, from 5 hours 46 minutes to 8 hours 25 minutes, accompanied by a shift in median sleep start time significantly earlier, from 02:39 to 00:46.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes an increase in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) and a decrease in self-reported happiness. The increase in resting heart rate and a shift towards higher hourly heart rates throughout the day, particularly in the evening, could suggest elevated physiological arousal. Furthermore, a decrease in health satisfaction may contribute to an overall increase in stress perception.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress includes a significant increase in actual and desired sleep duration, coupled with an improved sense of control over sleep, which are often associated with reduced stress. The increase in social interaction with friends and the more stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by increased interdaily stability and autocorrelation, may also be mitigating factors. The absence of significant changes in STAI-Trait anxiety and Self-Esteem scores, while showing slight increases in negative symptoms, indicates these trait measures have not drastically worsened. The initial PSS score had a negative correlation with change, suggesting that higher initial PSS scores were associated with decreases in PSS over time, indicating a potential for improvement for those starting with higher stress levels. However, this participant's initial PSS score was only slightly above average.

Considering the conflicting signals, the increase in markers of negative affect (depressive symptoms, decreased happiness, decreased health satisfaction) and physiological arousal (resting heart rate, overall heart rate elevation) are substantial indicators of increased stress. While improvements in sleep and social interaction are positive, they may not fully counterbalance the decline in subjective well-being and physiological stress markers. The increase in the frequency of alcohol consumption (wine or liquor) also leans towards a coping mechanism rather than a direct indicator of reduced stress. Therefore, the overall direction of change in perceived stress appears to be an increase.

96610,-2.0,"Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several notable changes across various self-reported and objectively measured domains between the two data collection periods. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, have decreased, with a score change of -1.0 and a negligible Z-score of change. Similarly, trait anxiety measured by the STAI has also decreased by 3.0 points. Self-esteem and happiness levels remained stable. Health satisfaction and trust also showed no significant change. Regarding sleep habits, while the perceived ease of falling asleep (sleep latency) and the feeling of control over sleep duration remained unchanged, the ideal and normal weekday sleep durations also showed no change. However, the median sleep duration measured by the wearable increased by over an hour, moving from 6 hours and 53 minutes to 7 hours and 57 minutes, with a substantial positive Z-score of delta, suggesting a significant increase in reported sleep duration.

Behaviorally, there have been shifts in physical activity. The frequency of exercising alone has increased significantly, from less than once a month to 1-2 times a week, evidenced by a positive delta number and a large positive Z-score of delta. Conversely, the frequency of exercising with others and engaging in sports has decreased substantially. Daily recreational habits show an increase in watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with time spent in these activities increasing. Listening to music has decreased from 15 minutes or less to no time spent. Socializing with friends has also seen an increase in time spent. Reading, previously not a reported activity, now occupies 16-30 minutes daily.

Physiologically, there are several changes in the wearable-derived metrics. The resting heart rate has increased by 8.3 bpm, with a notable positive Z-score of delta, indicating a significant rise. The Mesor, representing the mean heart rate, has also slightly increased. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has decreased, suggesting a reduction in the peak-to-trough variation. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm has slightly decreased, while intradaily variability has slightly increased. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, has shifted earlier by approximately 30 minutes. Notably, the median sleep duration from wearable data has increased, which contrasts with the stable self-reported sleep duration metrics.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is primarily linked to a significant increase in resting heart rate (+8.3 bpm), which has a large positive Z-score of delta (+1.8). A higher resting heart rate can be indicative of heightened physiological arousal, which is often associated with increased stress. Additionally, there is a slight increase in intradaily variability and a slight decrease in interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm, suggesting a less regular circadian pattern which can also be linked to stress.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is more prominent. Self-reported measures show a decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), both of which are strongly associated with stress. While sleep duration self-reports remained stable, the wearable data indicates a substantial increase in median sleep duration. Although this is a positive change in terms of duration, the lack of corresponding improvement in self-reported sleep quality or control metrics warrants consideration. Furthermore, the decrease in amplitude of the heart rate rhythm could suggest a less pronounced diurnal fluctuation which, in isolation, might indicate reduced stress.

Holistic analysis suggests that while some physiological markers, particularly the elevated resting heart rate and altered heart rate variability, point towards an increase in perceived stress, the significant reduction in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with an increase in objectively measured sleep duration, suggests a countervailing improvement. The initial PSS score was 21.0, which is close to the population mean (Z-score of -0.17), and there is a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) between the initial PSS and the change in PSS, implying that lower initial stress was associated with a greater increase in stress over time. Given the conflicting indicators, the more direct measures of psychological distress (anxiety and depression) have improved, and the increase in sleep duration is a positive factor. The elevated resting heart rate is a concern but does not, in isolation, negate the improvements in self-reported psychological well-being. Therefore, the overall perceived stress is likely to have remained stable or slightly decreased.

77711,-1.0,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

Analysis of the provided data indicates a significant shift in the participant's physiological and behavioral patterns between the two data collection periods. A notable increase in average resting heart rate (delta of 7.0, Z-score of 1.52) and a corresponding rise in the Mesor (mean circadian rhythm value, delta of 7.71, Z-score of 1.91) suggest a general elevation in physiological arousal. This is further supported by an increase in Intradaily Variability of heart rate (delta of 0.19, Z-score of 1.13), implying a more erratic or less stable heart rate pattern throughout the day. The Acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted later by 5 minutes, from 4:54 PM to 5:17 PM, although this change is not accompanied by a Z-score for its delta. While the participant reports no change in normal weekday sleep duration and a slight increase in sleep latency (5 minutes), their subjective feeling of control over sleep duration remains low, indicated by a consistent ""Disagree"" response.

Behavioral changes include a reduction in exercising alone, shifting from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta of -1.0, Z-score of -0.79). Conversely, participation in sports has increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta of 1.0, Z-score of 0.91). Substance usage, specifically beer and wine or liquor, has increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (delta of 1.0 for both, Z-scores of 0.70 and 0.73 respectively). There has been a substantial decrease in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" moving from ""1-2 hours"" to ""Do not do"" (delta of -4.0, Z-score of -2.74). Socializing with friends has also increased, with reported time increasing from ""1-2 hours"" to ""3-4 hours"" (delta of 2.0, Z-score of 1.47). Self-esteem has decreased by 4 points (Z-score of -0.72), while health satisfaction has significantly declined by 1.33 points (Z-score of -1.28). Trait anxiety (STAI) shows a minimal decrease of 1 point (Z-score of 0.11), and depressive symptoms (CES-D) remain stable. The initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 17.0, which was below the population average (Z-score of -1.26), is negatively correlated with changes in PSS, suggesting that higher initial stress might predict greater reduction over time.

### Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes a significant increase in resting heart rate and Mesor, indicative of elevated physiological arousal, and increased intradaily variability in heart rate. The decrease in self-esteem and a substantial decline in health satisfaction also point towards a potential increase in perceived stress. Furthermore, the observed increase in alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor) from monthly to weekly use could be an indicator of coping mechanisms related to elevated stress.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. While trait anxiety (STAI) and depressive symptoms (CES-D) remain largely stable, there are no direct measures indicating a reduction in overall perceived stress. The increase in time spent socializing with friends and the shift towards more structured sports activities might suggest positive coping strategies. However, the negative correlation of the initial PSS score with change implies that if the participant's initial stress levels were already moderate to low, further increases might be less likely to be moderated by these changes.

Holistically, the observed physiological indicators of increased arousal (elevated resting heart rate, Mesor, and intradaily variability) coupled with the significant decrease in self-esteem and health satisfaction, alongside increased alcohol consumption, provide stronger evidence for a worsening of the participant's perceived stress. While some behavioral changes are positive, they are overshadowed by the physiological markers and negative self-perceptions.

17020,-7.0,"This analysis synthesizes multimodal data to understand changes in perceived stress among a university student population. The initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 24.0, with a Z-score of 0.65, indicates a slightly elevated level of perceived stress relative to the study population. The significant negative correlation (-0.56) between the initial PSS score and its subsequent change suggests that participants with higher initial stress levels may experience a decrease in stress over time.

**Self-Reported Psychological and Lifestyle Changes:**

In terms of psychological well-being, notable improvements were observed. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score decreased from 10.0 to 8.0 (Z-score of delta: -0.09), moving away from the threshold for depressive symptoms. Crucially, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait) score showed a significant reduction from 40.0 to 33.0 (Z-score of delta: -0.66), indicating a substantial decrease in chronic anxiety proneness. While self-esteem remained relatively stable with a slight decrease from 40.0 to 39.0 (Z-score of delta: -0.16), the participant's overall trust score saw a modest increase from 3.17 to 3.33 (Z-score of delta: 0.31). Health satisfaction improved considerably, rising from 3.22 to 4.78 (Z-score of delta: 1.39), suggesting a more positive outlook on physical health.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, there have been shifts in sleep patterns. The perceived difficulty in falling asleep, measured by sleep latency, increased from 30.0 minutes to 45.0 minutes (Z-score of delta: 0.74). Despite this, the participant's desire for sleep increased from 7.0 to 8.0 hours (Z-score of delta: 0.85), and their perception of control over sleep duration significantly improved from ""Somewhat Disagree"" to ""Agree"" (change Z-score: 1.58). While normal weekday sleep duration remained constant at 7.0 hours, the median reported sleep duration increased by 35 minutes (Z-score of delta: 0.54).

Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor remained consistent at 1-2 times a month, but the frequency of wine or liquor consumption increased from ""Not at all"" to 1-2 times a month, indicated by a positive delta in usage numbers. Exercise habits showed a positive trend, with a notable increase in sports participation from 1-2 times a month to 1-2 times a week (delta: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.91). However, time spent on video games significantly increased, moving from ""Do not do"" to ""31 minutes an hour"" (delta: 3.0, Z-score of delta: 2.09), and internet usage also increased from 2-3 hours to 3-4 hours (delta: 1.0, Z-score of delta: 0.55). Socializing with friends saw a substantial increase in time spent from 16-30 minutes to 1-2 hours (delta: 2.0, Z-score of delta: 1.47).

**Wearable-Derived Physiological and Circadian Rhythm Metrics:**

Analysis of Fitbit data reveals significant changes in physiological regulation and circadian rhythmicity. The resting heart rate increased from 50.0 to 52.4 bpm (Z-score of delta: 0.55), and the mean heart rate across all hours (Mesor) also rose from 59.19 to 65.41 (Z-score of delta: 1.59). This increase in both resting and average heart rate, relative to population norms, may indicate an elevated physiological arousal state. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm also increased from 7.55 to 10.72 (Z-score of delta: 1.07), suggesting a greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day.

Circadian rhythm regularity has diminished. Interdaily stability decreased from 0.54 to 0.44 (Z-score of delta: -0.70), and intradaily variability also decreased from 0.55 to 0.36 (Z-score of delta: -1.57), indicating a less consistent daily pattern. Autocorrelation at 24 hours, a measure of daily rhythmicity, significantly decreased from 0.38 to 0.14 (Z-score of delta: -1.73). The acrophase, the time of day when the heart rate is highest, shifted later from 5:35 PM to 8:56 PM, suggesting a delayed peak in physiological activity.

Sleep duration variability, measured by standard deviation, increased from 108 minutes to 147 minutes (Z-score of delta: 1.03), indicating less consistent sleep durations. Conversely, the standard deviation of sleep start times decreased slightly. The median sleep start time has been significantly delayed, shifting by 1 hour and 28 minutes (Z-score of delta: 1.64), and median sleep duration has increased by 35 minutes.

**Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress:**

The participant's overall perceived stress appears to have improved. Several key indicators support this conclusion. Most notably, there was a substantial reduction in anxiety (STAI) and an improvement in health satisfaction. The increase in desired sleep duration and perceived control over sleep, coupled with an increase in median sleep duration, suggests better sleep hygiene and management, which are often associated with lower stress. While the increase in resting heart rate and Mesor, along with decreased circadian rhythm regularity, could suggest a physiological stress response, the concurrent improvement in psychological well-being indicators like anxiety and depression symptoms, along with increased social interaction and sports participation, points towards a net positive shift. The negative correlation between initial PSS and change in PSS further suggests that those who started with higher stress may have experienced a reduction. The increase in video game and internet usage, while potentially counter-stressful in some contexts, may also represent coping mechanisms or leisure activities adopted during this period, which have not overridden the positive psychological trends.

The participant exhibits notable shifts in psychological and behavioral indicators between the two data collection periods. A significant increase in depressive symptoms is evident, with the CES-D score rising from 12.0 (not depressed, Z-score -0.14) to 25.0 (depressed, Z-score 1.34), representing a substantial increase of 13.0 points (Z-score of delta 1.57). Concurrently, anxiety proneness has also escalated, with the STAI–Trait score increasing from 28.0 (not anxious, Z-score -1.31) to 46.0 (anxious, Z-score 0.63), an increase of 18.0 points (Z-score of delta 2.55). In contrast, self-esteem has shown a slight decline, with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score decreasing from 46.0 (Z-score 1.1) to 43.0 (Z-score 0.77), a difference of -3.0 points (Z-score of delta -0.53). Interpersonal trust has remained relatively stable, with a minor increase from a previous Z-score of -2.71 to a current Z-score of -2.41, a delta of 0.17. Self-reported happiness has decreased from 5.0 (Z-score 1.64) to 4.0 (Z-score 0.42), a change of -1.0 point (Z-score of delta -0.96). Health satisfaction has seen a minimal increase from 6.89 (Z-score 1.96) to 7.0 (Z-score 2.12), a delta of 0.11.

Regarding sleep habits, the participant reports a longer time to fall asleep, with sleep latency increasing from 15.0 minutes (Z-score -0.21) to 20.0 minutes (Z-score 0.03), a delta of 5.0 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.14). The desired weekday sleep duration has increased by 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta 0.85), from a previous desired time of 6.0 hours (Z-score -0.82) to 7.0 hours (Z-score -1.14). However, the reported normal weekday sleep duration has remained stagnant at 5.0 hours (Z-score -1.53), showing no change (delta 0.0 hours, Z-score of delta -0.09). Furthermore, the sense of control over sleep duration has diminished, with the participant moving from ""Strongly Agree"" (previous Z-score 1.78) to ""Somewhat Agree"" (current Z-score 0.45), a decrease of 2.0 units on the scale (change Z-score -1.4).

In terms of daily activities, the participant has reduced their time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies from 3-4 hours (previous Z-score 2.54) to 1-2 hours (current Z-score 1.0), a decrease of 2.0 hours (Z-score of delta -1.46). Internet usage has increased from 3-4 hours (previous Z-score 1.52) to ""more than 4 hours"" (current Z-score 1.96), an increase of 1.0 hour (Z-score of delta 0.55). There has been a substantial decrease in time spent socializing with friends, moving from 2-3 hours (previous Z-score 0.95) to 16-30 minutes (current Z-score -1.36), a reduction of 3.0 hours (Z-score of delta -2.11). Time spent listening to music has also decreased significantly, from 3-4 hours (previous Z-score 1.6) to 31 minutes an hour (current Z-score 0.19), a reduction of 3.0 hours (Z-score of delta -1.59).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates an increase in overall activity rhythm irregularity. Intradaily Variability has increased from 0.61 (previous Z-score 0.34) to 0.8 (current Z-score 1.37), an increase of 0.19 (Z-score of delta 1.13). Autocorrelation at 24 Hours has also increased from 0.34 (previous Z-score 0.42) to 0.5 (current Z-score 1.85), an increase of 0.16 (Z-score of delta 0.99). The MESOR, representing the central tendency of the circadian rhythm, has increased from 65.38 (previous Z-score -1.24) to 74.72 (current Z-score 0.13), a significant rise of 9.34 (Z-score of delta 2.27). Conversely, the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm has decreased from 8.24 (previous Z-score -0.78) to 6.66 (current Z-score -1.53), a reduction of 1.58 (Z-score of delta -0.54). The participant's resting heart rate has also increased from 52.5 (previous Z-score -0.75) to 60.2 (current Z-score 0.21), a rise of 7.7 (Z-score of delta 1.67). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals notable deviations from baseline. The current average heart rate during the 5-6 AM hour is significantly elevated at 85.05 compared to a previous average of 100.59, however, the 6-7 AM hour shows a substantial increase to 117.73 from 76.22 previously. The midday period (12 PM - 4 PM) shows generally elevated heart rates compared to the previous period, with hourly averages ranging from 70.51 to 75.94, compared to previous averages of 63.11 to 72.60. Evening hours (7 PM - 11 PM) also exhibit higher average heart rates in the current period compared to the previous.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes significant increases in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score delta of 13.0) and anxiety proneness (STAI score delta of 18.0). The decrease in feeling of control over sleep duration (change Z-score -1.4) and the decrease in socializing with friends (Z-score of delta -2.11) also suggest increased stress. Physiologically, the rise in resting heart rate (delta 7.7), the increased intradaily variability (Z-score of delta 1.13), and the elevated MESOR (Z-score of delta 2.27) indicate a heightened state of physiological arousal and dysregulation, consistent with increased stress. The significant reduction in sleep latency from baseline to current is not accompanied by an increase in actual sleep duration, suggesting a potential for dissatisfaction and increased perceived effort to achieve sleep.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. Health satisfaction has slightly increased, and interpersonal trust has shown a marginal improvement. While the average weekday sleep duration has remained stable, the desired sleep duration has increased, which might indicate a growing awareness of unmet sleep needs rather than an improvement. The reduction in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies could be interpreted as a positive shift towards more engaged activities, but this is counterbalanced by decreases in other social and recreational activities.

Considering the holistic evidence, the marked increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with physiological markers of heightened arousal and disrupted daily rhythms, strongly indicate a worsening of perceived stress. The initial PSS score was high (2.28 Z-score), and the negative correlation (-0.56) of the initial PSS with changes suggests that higher initial stress levels might be associated with further increases.

The participant exhibits several notable changes across various domains between the two data collection periods, potentially influencing their perceived stress levels. In terms of self-reported psychological states, the participant's scores on the STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) have increased by 2.0 points, moving from a Z-score of -0.13 to 0.22, indicating a slight increase in trait anxiety proneness. Conversely, their self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, has decreased by 2.0 points, from a Z-score of 0.11 to -0.11. Self-reported happiness has also decreased by 1.0 point, moving from a Z-score of 0.55 to -0.76. Health satisfaction has seen a significant decline, with a decrease of 1.56 points, shifting from a Z-score of 0.22 to -1.02, suggesting a worsening perception of their physical health.

Lifestyle behaviors also present mixed trends. The participant has increased their consumption of alcohol (beer and wine/liquor) from ""Not at all"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" with corresponding positive deltas in numerical usage and positive Z-scores of delta. Exercise habits show a notable increase in engagement with others, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" and a substantial increase in sports participation from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" Conversely, daily recreation habits indicate a significant increase in internet usage, moving from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""more than 4 hours"" (a change of 4.0 numerical units with a Z-score of delta of 2.57). There has also been a decrease in listening to music duration, and a shift from not reading to reading for ""15 minutes or less.""

Physiological data derived from the wearable device reveals a decrease in the participant's resting heart rate by 6.4 beats per minute, moving from a Z-score of 0.64 to -0.12. This is accompanied by a decrease in the Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of their heart rate circadian rhythm, and a reduction in the overall amplitude of this rhythm. The interdaily stability of their circadian rhythm has decreased, suggesting a less consistent daily pattern, and their 24-hour autocorrelation has also decreased significantly, indicating a reduced ability to predict heart rate at the same time on consecutive days. The median sleep duration has slightly increased by 28 minutes, with a positive Z-score of delta, while the median sleep start time has become later by 31 minutes, with a positive Z-score of delta.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence suggesting a worsening of perceived stress includes increases in trait anxiety (STAI score delta of 2.0, Z-score of delta 0.5) and a decrease in self-reported happiness (delta of -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.96). Furthermore, a notable decline in health satisfaction (delta of -1.56, Z-score of delta -1.49) may contribute to elevated stress. Behavioral changes such as increased internet usage (delta of 4.0, Z-score of delta 2.57) and increased substance usage (alcohol) are also associated with potential increases in stress. Physiologically, the decreased interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate suggest a less regulated circadian rhythm, which can be indicative of increased stress.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. The participant has increased their engagement in social and physical activities, with higher frequencies of exercising with others and participating in sports. Median sleep duration has also increased, which is generally a positive indicator. The decrease in resting heart rate and Mesor of the circadian rhythm, while potentially indicative of reduced physiological load, could also reflect other underlying changes that are not directly stress-related.

Holistically analyzing the available evidence, the increases in trait anxiety, decreases in happiness and health satisfaction, coupled with increased internet and substance usage, and a destabilized circadian rhythm pattern present a stronger case for an overall increase in perceived stress. While improvements in social and physical activities are noted, they do not appear to fully counterbalance the negative shifts in psychological well-being and behavioral patterns that are often associated with heightened stress.

The participant's self-reported data indicates some shifts in psychological well-being and behavioral habits. Notably, self-esteem has decreased significantly, with a substantial drop in the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (delta of -6.0), resulting in a negative Z-score of -1.09 for this change. This decrease in self-esteem is weakly, negatively correlated with changes in perceived stress (r = -0.06), suggesting a slight tendency for stress to increase as self-esteem declines. Concurrently, health satisfaction has also diminished, showing a notable decrease (delta of -0.89). While the participant's STAI-Trait anxiety scores remain low and have slightly decreased (delta of -2.0), the CES-D score for depressive symptoms has shown a small increase (delta of 1.0), though it remains in the ""Not depressed"" classification. Subjectively, the participant's desired weekday sleep duration has increased by 2.0 hours, reflecting a higher perceived need for sleep, although their actual normal weekday sleep duration has remained stable. The feeling of control over sleep duration has also remained stable.

From a behavioral perspective, there have been shifts in exercise patterns. While solitary exercise frequency has remained consistent, participation in exercising with others has decreased (delta of -1.0), and engagement in sports has increased from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (delta of 1.0). Recreational screen time has also decreased, with a marked reduction in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (delta of -1.0) and a slight increase in ""Internet Usage"" time. Substance usage patterns remain stable, with consistent weekly beer consumption and monthly wine or liquor consumption, and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 2.65 bpm, which is a moderate decrease relative to their population (Z-score of Delta = -0.52). The Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of their circadian rhythm has also slightly decreased, while the amplitude has increased. This suggests a potential increase in the daily fluctuation of their heart rate, with a potentially wider range between peak and trough. The interdaily stability of heart rate has improved, indicating a more consistent daily pattern, and intradaily variability has increased, suggesting more pronounced short-term fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The median sleep start time has shifted later by over an hour, with a corresponding increase in the variability of sleep start times. Notably, the median sleep duration has decreased significantly by 1 hour and 42 minutes, which is a substantial change with a Z-score of -2.18, and is weakly, positively correlated with changes in perceived stress (r = 0.03). The amplitude of sleep duration variability has also decreased slightly.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The data presents a mixed picture regarding the participant's perceived stress. On one hand, there is evidence of potential stressors, including a significant decrease in self-esteem and health satisfaction. The substantial reduction in median sleep duration, coupled with a later and more variable sleep start time, represents a significant deviation from previous patterns and has a small positive correlation with changes in perceived stress. Increased intradaily variability in heart rate could also be indicative of physiological strain.

However, there are also indicators of potential stress reduction or stability. The CES-D score remains in the ""Not depressed"" range, and STAI-Trait anxiety has slightly decreased. The improvement in interdaily stability of heart rate suggests a more regular daily physiological rhythm. Furthermore, the resting heart rate has decreased, which generally aligns with reduced physiological stress. Behavioral changes, such as reduced TV/video consumption and increased engagement in sports, could be interpreted as positive coping mechanisms. The initial PSS score was below the population mean (Z-score of -0.71), and the initial correlation of PSS score with its change over time was negative (-0.56), suggesting that higher initial stress was associated with decreases in stress over time, and vice versa. Given the substantial decrease in sleep duration, which is a key factor in stress regulation, and the negative correlation between self-esteem change and PSS change, the evidence points towards an increase in perceived stress.

This suggests a tendency towards stress regulation or adaptation in the population.

Self-reported measures reveal a decrease in depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D score reduction (delta of -8.0, Z-score of delta -0.75). This improvement is notable given the initial classification of ""Depressed."" Concurrently, trait anxiety (STAI) has shown a modest increase (delta of 2.0, Z-score of delta 0.5), moving from an anxious classification to remaining in the anxious category. Self-esteem has decreased (delta of -4.0, Z-score of delta -0.72), moving from a score of 30.0 to 26.0, yet remaining within a range considered relatively high compared to population norms. Health satisfaction has declined significantly (delta of -1.33, Z-score of delta -1.28), with the score decreasing from 3.44 to 2.11, suggesting a worsening perception of physical health. Trust levels remained stable, with no change observed (delta of 0.0, Z-score of delta -0.1). Happiness has increased significantly (delta of 2.0, Z-score of delta 1.55), with the score rising from 2.0 to 4.0, indicating an improved subjective state of well-being.

Behavioral habits reveal a substantial increase in daily internet usage, moving from 2-3 hours to more than 4 hours per day (delta of 2.0 hours, Z-score of delta 1.22). Conversely, time spent socializing with friends has decreased from 2-3 hours to 31 minutes an hour (delta of -2.0 hours, Z-score of delta -1.39). There has also been a significant increase in time spent listening to music, from not at all to 1-2 hours per day (delta of 4.0 hours, Z-score of delta 2.1). No changes were reported in substance usage, exercise frequency, or engagement in other sedentary hobbies such as watching TV, video games, or reading. Sleep patterns indicate a notable decrease in median sleep duration by 1 hour and 20 minutes (delta of -1.74 Z-score of delta), with the duration now averaging 4 hours and 29 minutes, which is substantially below population norms (Z-score of -3.29). The median sleep start time has also shifted later by 1 hour and 14 minutes (Z-score of delta 1.37), with a greater standard deviation in sleep start times.

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data indicate a general decline in circadian rhythm stability. Interdaily Stability has decreased (delta of -0.12, Z-score of delta -0.85), suggesting less consistency in daily patterns. Intradaily Variability has slightly increased (delta of 0.04, Z-score of delta 0.06), indicating a marginal increase in heart rate fluctuations within a day. Resting heart rate has decreased significantly by 7.0 bpm (delta of -1.44 Z-score of delta), now averaging 54.6 bpm, which is below the population average. The Mesor, a measure of average daily heart rate, has also decreased (delta of -6.39, Z-score of delta -1.16), and the Amplitude, representing the range of daily heart rate variation, has decreased by 2.48 bpm (delta of -0.84 Z-score of delta). These changes in Mesor and Amplitude, alongside the decrease in resting heart rate, suggest a reduction in overall physiological arousal. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, has shifted slightly later.

Analysis of the data suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing the participant's perceived stress. The decrease in depressive symptoms and increase in happiness are positive indicators. However, the increase in trait anxiety, decrease in self-esteem, and significant decline in health satisfaction present concerning trends. The observed changes in sleep, particularly the substantial reduction in duration and delayed start time, are significant and are often associated with increased stress. The increase in internet usage and decrease in social interaction with friends may reflect a shift towards less socially engaged behaviors, potentially contributing to heightened stress. Physiologically, the decrease in resting heart rate, Mesor, and Amplitude, while indicating reduced physiological arousal, could also reflect a general dampening of the stress response system, which may not necessarily be adaptive in the context of other indicators. The negative correlation between initial PSS and changes suggests that those starting with higher stress may have adapted better. Given the initial PSS score was above average, and the presence of worsening indicators such as increased anxiety, decreased health satisfaction, and significantly reduced sleep duration and quality, the overall trend indicates a likely increase in perceived stress.

33657,-5.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological and behavioral profile reveals several notable shifts between the two data collection periods. Significant increases in reported depressive symptoms (CES-D: +18.0, Z=2.13) and anxiety proneness (STAI: +16.0, Z=2.3) are observed. Concurrently, self-esteem has substantially decreased (SelfEsteem: -19.0, Z=-3.5). These shifts in emotional and self-perceptual states are accompanied by a decrease in reported health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction: -1.67, Z=-1.59) and an increase in Body Mass Index (BMI: +0.81). In terms of lifestyle behaviors, there is a notable reduction in the frequency of drinking beer (beer usage delta: -1.0) and a decrease in normal weekday sleep duration (Normal Weekday Sleep Duration: -1.0 hours, Z=-1.11). Furthermore, the participant reports feeling less in control over their sleep duration (Feeling of being in control over sleep duration delta: -1.0, Z=-0.8).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits reduced regularity, as indicated by a decrease in Interdaily Stability (IS: -0.02, Z=-0.11) and an increase in Intradaily Variability (IV: +0.27, Z=1.69). While the Acrophase has shifted later in the day, the Mesor, representing the average heart rate, has increased (Mesor: +3.32, Z=0.96), and the Amplitude, reflecting the extent of daily variation, has decreased (Amplitude: -0.92, Z=-0.31). Resting heart rate has also slightly increased (Resting Heart Rate: +3.2, Z=0.72). Examining the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals generally higher average heart rates across most hours compared to the previous period, with particularly pronounced increases during the morning (e.g., 9-10 AM: +6.93, 10-11 AM: +1.38) and evening hours (e.g., 5-6 PM: +8.68, 9-10 PM: +9.64). The sleep statistics indicate a reduction in median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration: -0.38) and a significant increase in the variability of sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Delta: +50 minutes, Z=1.3). The median sleep start time has also shifted later (Median Sleep Start Time Delta: +16 minutes, Z=0.28), and there is a considerable increase in the variability of sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Delta: +75 minutes, Z=1.56).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is primarily derived from the significant worsening of several key psychological indicators. The substantial rise in reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score increased by 18.0, Z=2.13) and anxiety proneness (STAI score increased by 16.0, Z=2.3) are strong indicators of elevated psychological distress. This is further supported by a marked decline in self-esteem (SelfEsteem score decreased by 19.0, Z=-3.5), which often correlates with increased stress. Furthermore, the decrease in health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction delta: -1.67, Z=-1.59) and the increase in BMI suggest a potential negative impact on physical well-being, which can be both a consequence and a contributor to stress. The reduction in normal weekday sleep duration (delta: -1.0 hours, Z=-1.11) and feeling less in control over sleep duration (delta: -1.0, Z=-0.8) are also indicative of increased stress impacting essential self-regulation.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced. While there is a decrease in beer consumption, this is a minor behavioral change compared to the significant psychological shifts. The correlations between changes in various metrics and changes in PSS score are generally low and do not consistently point towards stress reduction. For instance, the negative correlation between the initial PSS score and its change (-0.56) suggests that higher initial stress might be associated with some decrease, but this is overshadowed by the current indicators of worsening well-being.

Holistically analyzing the evidence, the overwhelming direction of change points towards an increase in perceived stress. The concurrent escalation of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and decline in self-esteem, coupled with negative changes in sleep patterns and health satisfaction, strongly suggests a worsening of the participant's psychological state, which is highly indicative of increased perceived stress.

36117,-3.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits notable shifts in several psychological and behavioral domains between the two data collection periods. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has increased from a state of ""not anxious"" to ""anxious,"" with a positive score delta of 2.0 and a Z-score of delta of 0.5. Conversely, self-reported happiness has significantly decreased, with a score delta of -2.0 and a Z-score of delta of -1.8, moving from a score of 5.0 to 3.0. Trust levels have also decreased, evidenced by a score delta of -0.67 and a Z-score of delta of -1.75. While self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD) show a slight decrease in score (delta of -1.0), the classification has shifted from ""depressed"" to ""not depressed,"" indicating a potential improvement in this area. Self-esteem has also declined, with a score delta of -5.0 and a Z-score of delta of -0.9. Health satisfaction has notably improved, with a score delta of 1.0 and a Z-score of delta of 0.87.

Behaviorally, there have been several changes. The participant has increased their engagement in video games, transitioning from not playing at all to playing an average of 31 minutes to an hour, represented by a significant positive delta in numerical usage (Delta Num: 3.0, Z-Score of Delta: 2.09). Concurrently, internet usage has decreased from over 4 hours to 2-3 hours (Delta Num: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.47), and socialising with friends has also decreased from over 4 hours to 2-3 hours (Delta Num: -2.0, Z-Score of Delta: -1.39). Listening to music has also decreased from 16-30 minutes to 15 minutes or less (Delta Num: -1.0, Z-Score of Delta: -0.54).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased from 72.3 bpm to 67.8 bpm, with a delta of -4.5 and a Z-score of delta of -0.91. The amplitude of their circadian rhythm, derived from heart rate, has also decreased from 18.57 to 14.79, with a delta of -3.78 and a Z-score of delta of -1.28. The MESOR, a measure of central tendency in heart rate, has also decreased from 92.44 to 86.29, with a delta of -6.15 and a Z-score of delta of -1.11. Sleep duration has shortened, with the median sleep duration decreasing by 44 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep duration has also decreased significantly by 34 minutes. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 17 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep start time has decreased substantially by 60 minutes.

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate increased regularity in the participant's daily activity patterns. Interdaily stability has increased from 0.64 to 0.68 (Z-Score of Delta: 0.34), and the autocorrelation at 24 hours has shown a substantial increase from 0.31 to 0.61 (Z-Score of Delta: 1.95). Conversely, intradaily variability has decreased from 0.29 to 0.35, indicating less fluctuation within the day. The acrophase has also shifted earlier, from 6:12 PM to 5:49 PM.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant's initial PSS score was 21.0, with a Z-score of -0.17, indicating a perceived stress level close to the population average. The correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS over time is -0.56, suggesting that individuals with lower initial PSS scores tend to experience greater increases in stress over time.

Analyzing the multimodal data for indicators of worsening perceived stress:
*   **Increased Anxiety:** The STAI score has moved into the ""anxious"" classification, with a positive delta of 2.0 and a Z-score of delta of 0.5.
*   **Decreased Happiness:** Self-reported happiness has significantly decreased by 2.0 points (Z-score of delta: -1.8).
*   **Decreased Trust:** Interpersonal trust has declined by -0.67 (Z-score of delta: -1.75).
*   **Decreased Self-Esteem:** Self-esteem has dropped by 5.0 points (Z-score of delta: -0.9).
*   **Reduced Sleep Duration and Stability:** Median sleep duration has decreased by 44 minutes, and the standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased by 34 minutes. The median sleep start time has become later, and its variability has decreased.
*   **Physiological Changes:** Resting heart rate has decreased, along with circadian rhythm amplitude and MESOR, which may suggest altered physiological responses.

Analyzing the multimodal data for indicators of improvement or stability in perceived stress:
*   **Improved Health Satisfaction:** Health satisfaction has increased by 1.0 point (Z-score of delta: 0.87).
*   **Improved Depressive Symptoms Classification:** While the score delta is small (-1.0), the classification has shifted from ""depressed"" to ""not depressed.""
*   **Increased Video Game Usage:** Engagement in video games has significantly increased.
*   **Increased Regularity in Activity:** Wearable data show increased interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggesting more structured daily routines.

The increase in self-reported anxiety, coupled with significant decreases in happiness and self-esteem, and a reduction in interpersonal trust, are strong indicators of increased perceived stress. While there are some positive indicators such as improved health satisfaction and increased activity pattern regularity, the psychological distress markers are more pronounced. The correlation of -0.56 for the initial PSS score with change suggests that an increase in stress is plausible for this participant. The shift in sleep metrics towards shorter duration and more rigid start times, while showing increased regularity, could also be interpreted as a consequence of increased stress rather than an improvement in well-being.

Holistically, the evidence points towards an increase in the participant's perceived stress. The decline in happiness and self-esteem, along with the rise in anxiety and decrease in trust, are significant negative psychological shifts that are often associated with heightened stress.

92515,-1.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological state shows nuanced changes. While the CES-D score, indicating depressive symptoms, has increased by 2.0 points (Z-score of delta 0.36), it remains within the ""Not depressed"" classification, and the correlation of this change with PSS is moderate (0.26). Similarly, the STAI trait anxiety score has increased by 1.0 point (Z-score of delta 0.37), also maintaining a ""not anxious"" classification with a low correlation (0.19) to PSS change. Conversely, self-esteem has decreased by 3.0 points (Z-score of delta -0.53), with a negligible correlation (-0.06) to PSS change. Trust has notably decreased by 0.67 points (Z-score of delta -1.75), though its correlation with PSS change is low (0.06). Happiness has also seen a significant decrease of 2.0 points (Z-score of delta -1.8), with a weak negative correlation (-0.13) to PSS change. Health satisfaction has marginally decreased by 0.33 points (Z-score of delta -0.36), with a very weak correlation (-0.04).

Behavioral habits reveal some notable shifts. Substance usage for beer has remained stable, but wine or liquor usage has decreased from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta -1.0, Z-score of delta -1.25), with no correlation to PSS change. Exercise frequency has increased, with ""Exercised Alone"" moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (delta 1.0, Z-score of delta 0.91), and sports frequency remains high. However, daily recreational habits show a significant increase in ""Video Games"" time, shifting from ""Do not do"" to ""2-3 hours"" (delta 5.0, Z-score of delta 3.54), which has a weak negative correlation (-0.04) to PSS change. Conversely, ""Listening to Music"" has decreased from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""Do not do"" (delta -2.0, Z-score of delta -1.06), and ""Socializing with Friends"" has decreased from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""16-30 minutes"" (delta -1.0, Z-score of delta -0.68).

Physiological metrics from the wearable data indicate a slight increase in resting heart rate by 2.0 bpm (Z-score of delta 0.46), with a very low correlation (-0.02) to PSS change. The mesor of the heart rate circadian rhythm has decreased by 2.22 bpm (Z-score of delta -0.25), and the amplitude has decreased by 1.27 bpm (Z-score of delta -0.43), suggesting a reduction in the daily variation of heart rate. The acrophase has shifted earlier, from 4:25 PM to 3:39 PM. Sleep duration has slightly increased by 18 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.21), and the standard deviation of sleep duration has increased by 29 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.8), indicating greater variability in sleep length. Sleep start time has also shifted slightly earlier by 18 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.38), while the standard deviation of sleep start time has decreased significantly by 49 minutes (Z-score of delta -0.96), suggesting more regular sleep onset timing.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress (increase) is suggested by the increase in the CES-D score, indicating a slight rise in depressive symptoms, and the decrease in self-esteem and happiness. The increase in video game usage, coupled with a decrease in socializing with friends and listening to music, may also contribute to increased stress. Physiologically, the slight increase in resting heart rate and greater variability in sleep duration could be indicators of elevated stress. The decrease in trust also points towards a potential increase in perceived stress.

Evidence for the improvement or stability of the PSS score (decrease/stable) is less pronounced but present. The STAI trait anxiety score remains low, and the increase in exercise frequency, particularly exercising alone and sports, is a positive behavioral change. The decrease in wine or liquor consumption is also a positive adjustment. The earlier sleep acrophase and more consistent sleep start times suggest improved sleep regularity, which can buffer stress. The reduced amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm may indicate a less demanding physiological response to daily fluctuations.

Holistically, while some indicators of improved sleep regulation and physical activity are observed, the concurrent decreases in self-esteem, happiness, and trust, alongside the slight increase in depressive symptoms and a notable increase in video game usage, suggest a potential overall increase in perceived stress. The negative correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS (-0.56) indicates that individuals with higher initial PSS scores tended to experience a decrease in PSS over time; however, this participant started with a below-average PSS score, and the observed changes lean towards increased stress.

48154,-4.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's psychological and behavioral profile reveals several notable shifts between the two data collection periods, impacting their perceived stress. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has decreased significantly (delta of -4.0, with a Z-score of -0.27 for the change), suggesting a reduction in chronic anxiety proneness. Similarly, the CES-D score, indicating depressive symptoms, remained stable with no change. Self-esteem and happiness scores also showed no change, suggesting these aspects of well-being remained consistent. A notable increase in health satisfaction was observed (delta of 0.44, with a Z-score of 0.36), indicating a more positive perception of physical health.

Regarding sleep, the participant reported an increase in sleep latency (delta of 5.0 minutes) and a decrease in their normal weekday sleep duration by one hour, which deviates from their previously higher average. Concurrently, their subjective feeling of control over sleep duration has significantly decreased, shifting from 'Agree' to 'Disagree'. This suggests a potential decline in the quality and perceived control of sleep, despite a reported increase in median sleep duration by 21 minutes. The standard deviation of sleep start time has also increased, indicating a more variable sleep schedule.

Behaviorally, the participant has increased their engagement in sports and recreational activities. They now engage in sports 'Three times a week or more,' an increase from '1-2 times a week.' There has also been an increase in the usage of recreational drugs, moving from 'Less than 1-2 times a month' to '1-2 times a month.' Furthermore, there is a substantial increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies (an increase of 2 hours) and listening to music (an increase of more than 3.5 hours), alongside an increase in overall internet usage. Conversely, time spent socializing with friends has decreased slightly. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, remained stable or decreased, with a notable decrease in exercising with others.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has slightly decreased (by 1.2 bpm), which is a positive indicator. However, their circadian rhythm metrics reveal an increase in the amplitude of heart rate variation (delta of 5.65), suggesting a greater difference between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. While the acrophase (peak heart rate time) has shifted earlier by 38 minutes, the MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm), representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, has increased slightly. Interdaily stability of heart rate has improved, indicating a more regular daily pattern, and autocorrelation at 24 hours has also increased, suggesting better maintenance of daily rhythms. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a significant increase in peak heart rate during the evening hours, particularly between 5-6 PM and 7-8 PM, reaching higher values than in the previous period, which might indicate increased physiological arousal during these times.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress can be inferred from several changes. The decrease in the feeling of control over sleep duration, coupled with increased sleep latency and decreased normal weekday sleep duration, points to potential sleep disruptions which are strongly linked to increased stress. The increase in the usage of recreational drugs is also a potential indicator of maladaptive coping mechanisms. Furthermore, the significant increase in time spent on sedentary activities like watching TV/movies and increased internet usage, coupled with a decrease in social interaction with friends, could indicate a withdrawal from more engaging social activities, which can be a sign of increasing stress or avoidance behaviors. The elevated peak heart rates during evening hours, despite a lower resting heart rate, might also suggest increased physiological reactivity and stress during specific times of the day.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is less pronounced but present. The significant reduction in self-reported anxiety (STAI) is a positive indicator. The CES-D score for depressive symptoms remained stable, indicating no worsening in this domain. Health satisfaction has increased, suggesting a more positive outlook on physical well-being. The resting heart rate has decreased, which is a favorable physiological change. The improved interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours in heart rate suggest a more regulated circadian rhythm.

Considering the multimodal data, the negative changes in sleep control and duration, coupled with increased recreational drug use and a shift towards more passive leisure activities, suggest a potential increase in perceived stress, even with the positive change in anxiety scores and resting heart rate. The data indicates a pattern of increased physiological arousal during specific evening hours and potentially less effective coping mechanisms for managing daily demands.

67709,4.0,"Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable increase in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a significant rise in the CES-D score (delta of 7.0, Z-score of delta 0.91), moving from an already depressed classification to a more pronounced state. Concurrently, there is a marked increase in trait anxiety, with the STAI score rising by 8.0 points (Z-score of delta 1.27), further contributing to a heightened psychological distress profile. This increase in anxiety and depression is concerning given the initial PSS score of 26.0, which was already above the population average.

Self-reported sleep patterns show a substantial deterioration. The participant now reports a normal weekday sleep duration of only 4.0 hours, a decrease of 3.0 hours from the previous assessment (Z-score of delta -3.13). This is accompanied by a decreased feeling of control over sleep duration. While sleep latency has improved slightly, the significant reduction in overall sleep duration and control suggests a potential exacerbation of sleep-related issues, which are strongly linked to perceived stress. The ideal weekday sleep time also decreased by 2.0 hours, indicating a shift towards lower sleep expectations.

Behaviorally, there has been a significant reduction in physical activity. The frequency of exercising with others has decreased substantially, from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""1-2 times a month"" (delta Num -2.0, Z-score of delta -1.15). Similarly, exercising alone has also decreased in frequency. This reduction in physical activity, a known stress-buffering behavior, coincides with the reported increases in negative psychological states. Conversely, there has been an increase in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (delta Num 3.0, Z-score of delta 1.74), and an increase in sedentary hobby time. Internet usage and listening to music have decreased, while socialising with friends has remained stable.

Physiologically, the Mesor (mean heart rate over a 24-hour period) has increased by 7.5 (Z-score of delta 1.87), indicating a higher average cardiovascular load. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm has also increased, suggesting a wider swing between peak and trough heart rate, which, in conjunction with a higher Mesor, could reflect heightened physiological arousal or stress responses. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier in the day. While interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate have slightly improved, suggesting a modest increase in rhythm regularity, these positive changes are overshadowed by the increase in Mesor and amplitude, and the overall decline in self-reported psychological well-being and sleep. Resting heart rate has also shown a moderate increase of 3.4 bpm (Z-score of delta 0.76).

The most significant changes in sleep patterns include a dramatic decrease in normal weekday sleep duration and a reduced sense of control over sleep. These changes are strongly correlated with increases in perceived stress, as evidenced by the negative correlation (-0.07) for normal weekday sleep duration and (-0.07) for feeling of control over sleep. The increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D delta correlation 0.25) and anxiety (STAI delta correlation 0.18) also suggests a worsening psychological state, which often accompanies elevated stress. The substantial increase in Mesor and Amplitude, along with the rise in resting heart rate, indicates a pattern of increased physiological arousal, which is consistent with elevated stress levels.

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of the perceived stress score (increase) is substantial and multifaceted. The participant exhibits a marked increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D score increased by 7.0 points, Z-score of delta 0.91) and a significant rise in trait anxiety (STAI score increased by 8.0 points, Z-score of delta 1.27). Self-reported sleep quality has deteriorated significantly, with a 3.0-hour decrease in normal weekday sleep duration (Z-score of delta -3.13) and a reduced sense of control over sleep. Physiologically, there is an increase in the Mesor (mean 24-hour heart rate) by 7.5 bpm (Z-score of delta 1.87) and an increase in circadian amplitude, indicative of heightened physiological arousal. Resting heart rate has also increased by 3.4 bpm (Z-score of delta 0.76). Behaviorally, there is a notable reduction in exercise frequency, particularly with others, and an increase in sedentary activities like watching TV and other sedentary hobbies. While some sleep metrics like sleep latency have improved, and circadian rhythm stability measures show minor improvements, these do not outweigh the significant negative trends in other key indicators. The initial PSS score of 26.0 was already elevated, and the concurrent worsening of psychological, behavioral, and physiological markers strongly suggests an overall increase in perceived stress.

The participant’s self-reported data reveals several notable changes across the two measurement periods. Perceived depressive symptoms, as indicated by the CES-D scale, have increased, moving from a score of 10.0 (not depressed) to 14.0 (not depressed), representing a 4-point increase that falls within the upper range of what is considered not depressed. Similarly, self-reported happiness has shown a positive shift, increasing from a score of 3.0 to 4.0, a change of 1 point that is moderately higher than the study population’s mean. In contrast, self-esteem has slightly decreased from 40.0 to 38.0, a 2-point decline which, while modest, moves the score closer to the population average. Health satisfaction has also decreased, from a high of 5.0 to 4.44, a change of -0.56, indicating a slight dip in overall satisfaction with physical health. Regarding sleep habits, there has been a significant improvement in sleep latency, decreasing from 15.0 minutes to 5.0 minutes, a 10-minute reduction that is notably faster than the population average. However, the normal weekday sleep duration has increased by 1 hour, from 6.0 hours to 7.0 hours, placing it above the population average. Trust in others has shown a marginal increase, from 3.33 to 3.5, a small positive change.

Behaviorally, the participant has ceased all beer consumption, a significant shift from previous usage of ""Less than 1-2 times a month."" Exercise habits show an increase in exercising with others, shifting from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month,"" suggesting an increase in social engagement during physical activity. Conversely, participation in sports has decreased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""Not at all."" There has been a substantial reduction in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies, decreasing from a range of ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""15 minutes or less,"" a 2-point decrease in the categorized time spent, which is notably lower than the population average. Listening to music has also decreased from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""15 minutes or less."" Conversely, internet usage has slightly increased from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""1-2 hours,"" and time spent socializing with friends has increased from ""31 minutes an hour"" to ""1-2 hours."" Sedentary hobby time has also increased from ""15 minutes or less"" to ""16-30 minutes.""

Physiologically, as derived from wearable data, there are several trends indicating changes in circadian rhythm and heart rate patterns. Interdaily stability of the circadian rhythm has improved, moving from 0.35 to 0.43, suggesting a more consistent daily rhythm. This is accompanied by an increase in intraday variability, from 0.76 to 0.86, indicating greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours has decreased from 0.29 to 0.23, suggesting a slightly weaker day-to-day predictability of heart rate patterns. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted earlier in the day, from 4:11 PM to 2:59 PM. The Mesor, representing the average daily heart rate, has decreased from 76.06 to 69.65, and the amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation, has increased from 8.11 to 9.85. The resting heart rate has decreased by 5.0 bpm, from 63.6 to 58.6, falling below the population average. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data, compared to the previous period, indicates lower average heart rates across most hours of the day, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours, while the midday and early afternoon hours generally show higher average heart rates. Notably, the previous hourly heart rate data exhibited significantly higher values across almost all hours compared to the current data, especially during the peak afternoon hours.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a slight increase in median sleep duration by 6 minutes, from 6 hours 23 minutes to 6 hours 29 minutes, though the z-score indicates this duration remains below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration has increased by 30 minutes, suggesting greater variability in sleep length from night to night. A significant shift has occurred in the median sleep start time, which has moved earlier by over an hour, from 01:28:30 to 00:26:45. The standard deviation of sleep start time has decreased by 11 minutes, indicating more consistent sleep onset times.

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress includes an increase in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score increase) and a decrease in health satisfaction. The reduction in resting heart rate and the shift in acrophase earlier in the day, coupled with decreased Mesor and increased Amplitude, could indicate a physiological state that may be reactive to stressors. The increased variability in sleep duration and a shift in sleep onset time also suggest potential disruptions that could contribute to stress. The decrease in autocorrelation at 24 hours further points to a less predictable daily rhythm, which can be associated with stress.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is present in the increase in self-reported happiness and the significant reduction in sleep latency, indicating an easier time falling asleep. The cessation of beer consumption is also a positive behavioral change. While the overall sleep duration is still below average, there has been an increase in normal weekday sleep duration. The increase in exercising with others and socializing with friends indicates positive social engagement. The substantial reduction in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies is also a positive change in leisure habits. The improvement in interdaily stability of the circadian rhythm suggests a more regular daily schedule.

Holistically evaluating the evidence, the increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in health satisfaction are significant indicators of worsening psychological well-being and potential increases in perceived stress. While positive behavioral and sleep improvements are evident, they do not fully counteract the negative indicators in the self-report mental health measures. The physiological data presents a mixed picture, with some indicators pointing towards increased reactivity, which, in conjunction with the negative self-reports, suggests an overall trend towards increased perceived stress.

This participant exhibits several noteworthy changes between the two data collection periods, particularly in self-reported psychological states and behavioral habits, which may be indirectly related to perceived stress. A significant finding is the decrease in trait anxiety, as evidenced by a reduction in the STAI score from 40 to 36. This shift moves the participant from an ""anxious"" classification to ""not anxious,"" indicating a potential improvement in their baseline anxiety proneness. Concurrently, self-esteem has demonstrably increased, with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score rising from 38 to 45, representing a substantial positive change (Z-score of delta = 1.32). This increase in self-esteem is positively correlated with a decrease in perceived stress change (correlation = -0.05), suggesting a protective effect. While the CES-D score has increased by 4 points, moving from 8 to 12, it remains within the ""Not depressed"" classification, and the change's Z-score (0.58) is moderate.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant has increased their engagement in various physical activities. There has been a notable increase in exercising alone (from less than 1-2 times a month to 1-2 times a month, Delta Num = 1.0, Z-score of Delta = 0.91), exercising with others (from 1-2 times a month to 1-2 times a week, Delta Num = 1.0, Z-score of Delta = 1.0), and participating in sports (from 1-2 times a month to 1-2 times a week, Delta Num = 1.0, Z-score of Delta = 0.91). These increases in structured exercise are among the more pronounced behavioral shifts. In contrast, there have been significant increases in sedentary leisure activities. Most notably, daily recreational screen time has risen sharply, with ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" increasing from 15 minutes or less to 1-2 hours (Delta Num = 3.0, Z-score of Delta = 1.74), and ""Internet Usage"" increasing from 31 minutes to an hour to 2-3 hours (Delta Num = 2.0, Z-score of Delta = 1.22).

Sleep patterns have also shown alterations. The participant now reports a normal weekday sleep duration of 7 hours, an increase from 6 hours (Delta = 1.0 hours, Z-score of Delta = 0.92), indicating an improvement in meeting their perceived sleep needs on weekdays. However, self-reported sleep latency has increased from 25 minutes to 30 minutes, which is a modest change. Wearable data reveals a significant shift in sleep timing, with the median sleep start time becoming 1 hour and 21 minutes earlier (Delta = 1 hours 21 minutes, Z-score of Delta = -1.56). This earlier bedtime is accompanied by an increase in median sleep duration of 39 minutes. Physiological data from the wearable indicates a decrease in the overall average heart rate (Mesor) and amplitude, suggesting a potential reduction in overall physiological load or activity, although the Z-scores of these changes (-1.54 and -0.88 respectively) are within a moderate range. The resting heart rate has also decreased by 3.45 bpm, which is a moderate reduction.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The available data presents a mixed picture regarding changes in perceived stress. On one hand, there are positive indicators. The participant shows a decrease in trait anxiety (STAI score reduction) and a significant increase in self-esteem, both of which are generally associated with lower levels of stress. Their reported normal weekday sleep duration has increased, and their actual median sleep duration has also lengthened, alongside an earlier sleep start time, which could contribute to better stress management. Physiologically, a decrease in Mesor and Amplitude, along with a lower resting heart rate, might suggest a reduction in physiological arousal.

However, other factors introduce complexity. The CES-D score has increased, indicating a slight rise in depressive symptoms, although it remains within the non-depressed range. Most strikingly, there has been a substantial increase in sedentary leisure activities, particularly in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and ""Internet Usage."" While not directly measuring stress, significant increases in screen time can sometimes be associated with avoidance behaviors or a lack of engagement in more restorative activities, potentially reflecting underlying stress. Furthermore, the initial PSS score correlation with the change in PSS score is -0.56, suggesting that individuals with higher initial PSS scores experienced a decrease in PSS over time, while those with lower initial scores might have experienced an increase. The participant's initial PSS score of 23.0 is slightly above average (Z-score 0.38), placing them in a zone where a slight increase might be more probable based on this correlation. The correlation between the change in ""Feeling of being in control over sleep duration"" and the change in PSS is -0.07, indicating a slight tendency for increased perceived control over sleep to be associated with a decrease in stress, but this effect is weak.

Considering the positive shifts in anxiety, self-esteem, and objective sleep duration, alongside the physiological indicators suggesting reduced arousal, there is evidence pointing towards an improvement or stabilization. However, the significant increase in passive leisure activities, the slight increase in depressive symptom scores, and the initial PSS score's potential trajectory for individuals in this initial range temper a definitive conclusion of improvement. Without the direct PSS score for the second wave, a precise determination is challenging. However, the substantial increases in anxiety-reducing factors (self-esteem, reduced trait anxiety) and sleep improvements are compelling. While the increase in passive screen time is a concern, it is not definitively linked to a stress increase in this dataset. The decrease in Mesor and Amplitude, along with the resting heart rate reduction, suggests a general physiological calming. Given the aggregate of these changes, particularly the significant improvements in self-esteem and trait anxiety, and objective sleep metrics, the overall perceived stress is likely to have remained stable or decreased.

29134,-3.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant demonstrates several notable shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods. A significant improvement is observed in self-reported emotional states, with a substantial decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale (delta of -7.0, with a Z-score of -0.64 for the change), and a parallel reduction in trait anxiety as indicated by the STAI-Trait scale (delta of -7.0, with a Z-score of -0.66 for the change). Self-esteem remained stable, while self-reported happiness decreased by 1.0 point (Z-score of -0.96 for the change), which warrants further attention in conjunction with other indicators. Health satisfaction saw a modest increase. Substance usage patterns indicate a shift towards more frequent use of recreational drugs and non-prescribed drugs, moving from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" for both categories, with notable positive Z-scores for the change in number of occurrences. Exercise habits remained consistent, with participation in sports and group exercise sessions at a high frequency. Daily recreational activities show a decrease in internet usage time and socializing with friends, alongside an increase in listening to music and a decrease in reading time.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 2.4 bpm, moving from a slightly above-average to an average resting heart rate (Z-score of -0.47 for the change). The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals an overall reduction in mean heart rate during nighttime hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM) in the current period compared to the previous. Conversely, several daytime and evening hours exhibit higher average heart rates, particularly during the late morning and evening (e.g., 9-10 AM, 10-11 AM, 11-12 PM, 12-1 PM, 3-4 PM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM). These shifts in hourly heart rate patterns, coupled with a reduced MESOR (mean heart rate over 24 hours) but increased Amplitude, suggest potential alterations in the daily rhythmicity of cardiovascular activity. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a decrease in Interdaily Stability and an increase in Intradaily Variability, suggesting a less regular daily pattern of heart rate. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) has advanced by approximately one hour. Sleep duration has slightly increased, but the variability in sleep duration has notably increased (delta of 50 minutes, Z-score of 1.3 for the change), while the standard deviation of sleep start time has significantly decreased, indicating more consistent bedtimes.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The data presents a mixed picture regarding changes in perceived stress. On one hand, there are strong indicators of improvement in psychological well-being, specifically a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. These are positively correlated with a decrease in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, with the initial PSS score showing a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) with changes in PSS. The decrease in resting heart rate could also be interpreted as a potential reduction in physiological arousal associated with stress.

However, there are also concerning indicators. The increase in the use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs, while not directly linked to PSS in this dataset, often correlates with attempts to manage psychological distress. Furthermore, the decrease in self-reported happiness, despite improvements in other mood indicators, suggests a nuanced emotional state. The increased variability in sleep duration and the shift in hourly heart rate patterns towards higher peaks during certain daytime and evening hours, along with reduced Interdaily Stability and increased Intradaily Variability in heart rate, could be indicative of heightened physiological stress or disruption in daily routines. The decrease in internet usage time and socializing with friends might reflect changes in coping mechanisms or social engagement that could impact stress levels.

Considering the significant reductions in anxiety and depression, which are primary drivers of perceived stress, and the initial PSS score's negative correlation with change, it is plausible that these improvements outweigh the less clear indicators. The increase in sleep duration, despite increased variability, is also generally beneficial. The increase in drug usage is a concern but may not directly translate to an increase in *perceived* stress if it's a maladaptive coping strategy. The decrease in overall happiness warrants consideration, but the strong improvements in anxiety and depression are more direct indicators for stress.

24029,-13.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits significant shifts in psychological well-being and lifestyle behaviors between the two data collection periods. A notable improvement is observed in the reduction of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a substantial decrease in the CES-D score (delta of -18.0, Z-score of delta -1.86). Similarly, the participant reports a substantial reduction in anxiety, with the STAI score decreasing by 17.0 points (Z-score of delta -1.94). Concurrently, self-esteem has markedly increased, with a score delta of 15.0 (Z-score of delta 2.8), suggesting a positive shift in self-perception. These improvements in mood and anxiety are associated with negative correlations to changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, suggesting that these positive psychological shifts may be contributing to reduced stress.

In terms of sleep habits, the participant's self-reported sleep latency has increased by 5.0 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.14). While ideal and normal weekday sleep durations have remained unchanged, the feeling of control over sleep duration has also remained stable. Wearable data indicates a positive change in median sleep duration, increasing by 37 minutes (Z-score of delta 0.58) and a decrease in the variability of sleep duration (delta -35 minutes, Z-score of delta -0.74). However, there is a substantial and concerning shift in median sleep start time, moving later by over 3 hours (Z-score of delta 3.59), which is negatively correlated with changes in PSS. This shift may be indicative of a disrupted circadian rhythm, despite some improvements in sleep regularity as suggested by the decrease in intradaily variability (delta -0.3, Z-score of delta -2.35) and an increase in interdaily stability (delta 0.05, Z-score of delta 0.41).

Behavioral changes are mixed. While substance usage remains negligible, there has been a significant decrease in exercise frequency across all categories, particularly in ""Sports"" which has decreased from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""Not at all"" (delta -4.0, Z-score of delta -2.54). Daily recreational habits have shifted, with a notable increase in video game usage (delta 3.0, Z-score of delta 2.09) and a decrease in listening to music (delta -5.0, Z-score of delta -2.64). Conversely, time spent socializing with friends and reading has increased. The increase in video game usage is positively correlated with changes in PSS, suggesting it may be a maladaptive coping mechanism.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate has remained stable. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a significant alteration in daily patterns. The previous data indicated a clear diurnal rhythm with lower heart rates during the night and higher rates during the day, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening. The current data shows a substantially elevated heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM) and a general blunting of the evening peak. This shift in heart rate patterns, particularly the elevated nocturnal heart rates, coupled with the delayed sleep onset, suggests a potential disruption in circadian regulation and increased physiological arousal during the night. The acrophase has shifted significantly later in the day (from 2:24 PM to 5:06 PM), and while the MESOR has slightly decreased, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has increased.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress (increase) is primarily suggested by the substantial and statistically significant delay in the median sleep start time (Z-score of delta 3.59), which is negatively correlated with changes in PSS. The significant increase in video game usage, also negatively correlated with PSS changes, could represent a maladaptive coping strategy that contributes to stress. Furthermore, the notable reduction in exercise frequency, particularly in sports, may also be a factor contributing to increased stress levels. The observed changes in hourly heart rate data, with elevated rates during nighttime hours and a delayed acrophase, indicate a potential disruption in physiological regulation and circadian rhythm, which can be associated with heightened stress.

Evidence for the improvement or stability of the PSS score (decrease/stable) is supported by the significant improvements in self-reported mental health. The marked reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D delta -18.0, Z-score of delta -1.86) and anxiety (STAI delta -17.0, Z-score of delta -1.94) are strong indicators of reduced psychological distress. The substantial increase in self-esteem (delta 15.0, Z-score of delta 2.8) further supports a positive shift in the participant's psychological state. Additionally, objective sleep duration has increased, and its variability has decreased, which are generally positive indicators for well-being.

Holistically analyzing the evidence, while there are strong positive indicators in self-reported mood and anxiety, the significant disruptions in sleep timing and physiological regulation, coupled with increased maladaptive behaviors like excessive video gaming and decreased physical activity, suggest a concerning trend. The negative correlation between these disruptive factors and PSS changes, despite the improvements in mood, indicates a potential for increasing stress that may not be fully captured by the current self-report measures of mood alone. The significant shift in sleep onset time and the corresponding changes in heart rate patterns are particularly concerning and often directly linked to increased perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, have shown a notable increase, with a score delta of 6.0 and a positive z-score of change (0.8), indicating a greater burden of depressive symptoms compared to the previous assessment. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has also increased, with a score delta of 1.0 and a positive z-score of change (0.71), suggesting a potential incongruence between reported mood states and depressive symptomology, or that happiness has increased independently of depressive symptoms. Anxiety levels, assessed by the STAI, have shown a modest increase of 2.0 points, with a positive z-score of change (0.5), though the participant remains classified as ""not anxious."" Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, has remained unchanged.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant has demonstrated a significant increase in exercise frequency, particularly in ""Exercised Alone"" (delta of 2.0 with a z-score of 1.77) and ""Sports"" (delta of 3.0 with a z-score of 2.28). This shift in physical activity is a marked positive change. Conversely, there has been a substantial decrease in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" with a time delta of -3.0 and a z-score of -2.1, indicating a reduction in passive leisure activities. There has also been a decrease in ""Socializing with Friends"" (delta of -1.0, z-score of -0.68) and ""Listening to Music"" (delta of -1.0, z-score of -0.54). Notably, the participant has transitioned from engaging in ""31 minutes an hour"" of sedentary hobbies to ""Do not do"" (delta of -3.0, z-score of -1.68), representing a significant decrease in sedentary behavior. Substance usage patterns remain stable across all categories.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a significant decrease in their resting heart rate, with a delta of -10.7 and a highly negative z-score of change (-2.22). This indicates a substantial improvement in cardiovascular health or a reduced state of physiological arousal at rest. The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of the heart rate rhythm, has also decreased significantly (delta of -8.08, z-score of -1.53), further supporting a reduction in overall physiological load. In contrast, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has increased (delta of 4.41, z-score of 1.49), suggesting a greater diurnal variation in heart rate, potentially reflecting increased engagement during wakeful periods. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm has shifted later in the day, from 5:00 PM to 6:27 PM.

Circadian rhythm metrics indicate an improvement in interdaily stability (delta of 0.06, z-score of 0.48) and intradaily variability (delta of 0.1, z-score of 0.49), suggesting a more regular and less variable daily heart rate pattern. Sleep statistics reveal a slight increase in median sleep duration (delta of 0 hours 18 minutes, z-score of 0.21) and a notable decrease in the standard deviation of sleep duration (delta of -25 minutes, z-score of -0.49), indicating more consistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time has shifted slightly later by 9 minutes, with a marginal positive z-score of change (0.15). The standard deviation of sleep start time has decreased substantially (delta of -28 minutes, z-score of -0.54), suggesting more regularity in sleep timing.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Analysis of the available data indicates several factors that could influence perceived stress. The increase in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score delta of 6.0, z-score 0.8) and a slight increase in anxiety (STAI score delta of 2.0, z-score 0.5) are indicators that might suggest an increase in perceived stress. Furthermore, a decrease in socializing with friends and listening to music could also be associated with higher stress levels for some individuals.

However, there are also significant indicators suggesting a potential reduction or stability in perceived stress. The substantial increase in exercise frequency, particularly in sports and solo exercise, is a strong positive indicator for stress management. The notable decrease in sedentary activities, including a complete cessation of sedentary hobbies and a significant reduction in watching TV/videos/movies, points towards a healthier and potentially less stressful lifestyle engagement. The significant decrease in resting heart rate and Mesor of the heart rate rhythm suggests a marked reduction in physiological arousal and stress load. The improved interdaily stability and intradaily variability of the heart rate rhythm, alongside more consistent sleep duration and timing, also point towards a more regulated and less stressful internal state. The increase in self-reported happiness, despite the rise in depressive symptoms, complicates a clear interpretation but could indicate an independent positive emotional trajectory.

Considering the strong positive changes in physical activity, significant physiological improvements indicative of reduced arousal and better regulation (lower resting heart rate, Mesor, more stable sleep and circadian patterns), and a substantial reduction in sedentary behavior, the evidence leans towards an overall improvement or stability in perceived stress, despite the increase in reported depressive symptoms. The correlation of the initial PSS score with the change in PSS score is -0.56, which suggests that individuals with higher initial PSS scores experienced a greater decrease in PSS over time. Given the participant's initial PSS score of 23.0, which is slightly above average (Z-Score: 0.38), this negative correlation implies that they may have experienced a reduction in stress. The positive changes in physiological markers and lifestyle habits are more potent indicators of stress reduction than the increase in depressive symptoms in this context.

The participant's psychological state, as indicated by self-reported measures, shows a notable reduction in trait anxiety, with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score decreasing from the anxious range (0.56 Z-score) to the non-anxious range (-0.19 Z-score). Concurrently, self-esteem has shown a positive trend, increasing by 4 points and reaching a Z-score of 0.04, indicating a movement towards the population average. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, have also slightly decreased, moving from a Z-score of 0.07 to -0.05, indicating a stable, non-depressed state. Interpersonal trust has marginally increased (Z-score 0.31 for the change), and self-reported happiness has remained stable (0.0 change).

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, there have been several shifts. Substance usage for both beer and wine/liquor has remained stable. However, there is a significant increase in the reported usage of recreational drugs, moving from ""Not at all"" to ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" accompanied by a substantial positive Z-score for this change (1.97). Exercise habits indicate a decrease in exercising alone, shifting from ""Three times a week or more"" to ""1-2 times a week."" Conversely, exercising with others has remained stable. Sports engagement has also remained constant. Daily recreational activities show an increase in time spent playing video games and general internet usage, while time spent watching TV/videos/movies and socializing with friends has decreased. Reading and other sedentary hobbies have remained unchanged.

Physiological and sleep metrics reveal mixed patterns. The participant's resting heart rate has increased significantly, rising by 7.4 bpm to a Z-score of 1.28. This increase is accompanied by an elevated Mesor (mean heart rate during the day) by 4.41 bpm (Z-score 1.19). However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm has decreased substantially, dropping by -4.46 (Z-score -1.51), suggesting a flattened daily heart rate fluctuation. Interdaily stability in heart rate has slightly increased (0.01 Z-score delta), indicating a marginal improvement in daily regularity. Conversely, intradaily variability has decreased by -0.12 (Z-score -1.07), suggesting a less variable heart rate throughout the day. The median sleep duration has dramatically increased by over 2 hours, reaching a Z-score of 2.04 and indicating a substantial shift towards longer sleep. This is supported by a decrease in the standard deviation of sleep duration, suggesting more consistent sleep length. However, the self-reported feeling of control over sleep duration has decreased, moving from ""Agree"" to ""Somewhat Agree."" The median sleep start time has become slightly earlier by 15 minutes, but the standard deviation of sleep start times has decreased, indicating more consistent bedtimes.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant's initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was 23.0, with a Z-score of 0.38, suggesting a slightly higher than average stress level at baseline. The correlation between the initial PSS score and changes in PSS over time is -0.56, indicating a moderate tendency for those with higher initial stress to experience a reduction in stress over time.

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is limited. The most prominent physiological indicator suggesting potential stress is the significant increase in resting heart rate by 7.4 bpm (Z-score 1.61) and an elevated Mesor (4.41 bpm, Z-score 1.19). A decrease in the amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm by -4.46 (Z-score -1.51) could also, in some contexts, reflect a dampened physiological response to daily demands. Furthermore, the decrease in the feeling of control over sleep duration, moving from ""Agree"" to ""Somewhat Agree,"" could be a contributing factor to increased stress. A notable change is the increase in the usage of recreational drugs, which is generally associated with increased risk and potential stress.

Conversely, substantial evidence points towards an improvement or stability in perceived stress. The most significant positive change is the dramatic increase in median sleep duration by over 2 hours (Z-score 2.38), suggesting improved recovery and potentially reduced stress. The STAI trait anxiety score has decreased significantly, moving from the anxious range to the non-anxious range. Self-esteem has increased, and depressive symptoms have slightly decreased, both moving in a direction associated with lower stress. While the feeling of control over sleep has decreased, the overall sleep duration has increased and the variability of sleep onset has decreased, which are generally positive sleep indicators. The increase in recreational drug usage is a concern, but its correlation with changes in PSS is very low (-0.0), suggesting it is not a primary driver of stress changes in this dataset.

Holistically, the improvement in key psychological indicators like anxiety and self-esteem, coupled with the significant increase in sleep duration and reduced variability, strongly suggest a reduction in perceived stress, despite some concerning physiological changes and a new substance usage pattern. The overall direction of change in perceived stress is towards improvement.

22842,-1.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notable shift in sleep patterns over the two-year period, accompanied by a decrease in overall health satisfaction. Specifically, there is a significant reduction in median sleep duration, from approximately 7 hours and 51 minutes to 6 hours and 40 minutes, representing a decrease of over an hour. This reduction is further underscored by a substantial increase in sleep duration variability, indicating less consistent sleep. Concurrently, the participant's desired sleep duration has increased by 2 hours, suggesting a growing discrepancy between actual and desired sleep, and a potential deficit in perceived restorative sleep. The increase in sleep latency (though the delta is 0, the Z-score of the delta is close to 0) from the previous period, which was already at a high Z-score of 2.02, indicates a persistent difficulty in falling asleep.

In terms of physiological markers, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by 2.6 beats per minute, with a corresponding Z-score of -0.51 for the change, indicating a move towards a lower baseline heart rate, potentially reflecting improved cardiovascular fitness or a reduction in physiological arousal. This is reflected in the hourly aggregated heart rate data, which shows a generalized decrease across most hours of the day compared to the previous period. Notably, the peak heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening hours (approximately 2 PM to 9 PM) has significantly reduced from the prior observation. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm metrics reveal a decrease in Mesor, the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, and a reduction in amplitude, indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. While interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm remains unchanged, intradaily variability has increased, suggesting more erratic heart rate patterns within a day. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, has shifted slightly later by 12 minutes.

Self-reported psychological measures indicate a slight increase in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale, though the classification remains ""Depressed."" Anxiety levels, as assessed by the STAI, have remained stable. Self-esteem has decreased by 4 points, moving the score further from the population mean. Health satisfaction has declined, with a notable decrease from 5.44 to 4.67 on a 7-point scale. In terms of lifestyle, there has been an increase in the frequency of beer consumption, and a decrease in wine or liquor consumption to ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, has remained stable, as has the frequency of engaging in sports. Daily recreational habits show a decrease in time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, with a concurrent increase in internet usage time.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence for the worsening of the perceived stress score (increase) stems from several indicators. The significant decrease in median sleep duration, coupled with an increased desire for sleep and increased sleep variability, points towards sleep deprivation and disruption, which are commonly associated with elevated stress. The reported decline in health satisfaction further suggests a general reduction in well-being. Additionally, the decrease in self-esteem and the slight increase in depressive symptoms could be indicative of a heightened stress burden impacting psychological states. The increase in the Z-score of the change in CES-D score (0.36), while not excessively large, indicates a movement towards a higher symptom load for depression.

Conversely, evidence for the improvement or stability of the PSS score (decrease/stable) is less pronounced but present. The decrease in resting heart rate and the overall reduction in aggregated hourly heart rates, particularly during peak activity times, suggests a potential physiological adaptation towards a less reactive state. The reduction in the Mesor and Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm also points to a potential normalization of physiological rhythms. The increased use of the internet for leisure, while not necessarily beneficial, may represent a shift in coping mechanisms. The reduction in wine or liquor consumption to ""Not at all"" could also be viewed as a positive behavioral change, potentially mitigating stress-related substance use.

Considering the multimodal data, the indicators of increased stress, particularly concerning sleep disruption, reduced health satisfaction, and potential negative shifts in psychological well-being (increased depressive symptoms, decreased self-esteem), appear more salient and impactful on perceived stress. While physiological markers show some signs of a reduced stress response, the subjective experience of sleep deprivation and diminished overall well-being strongly suggests an escalation in perceived stress. The negative correlation of the initial PSS score with changes (-0.56) suggests that participants with initially higher stress may have seen reductions, but this participant started near the mean, making the indicators of worsening more impactful.

The participant exhibits significant shifts in psychological and behavioral metrics between the two data collection periods. Notably, there is a substantial increase in reported depressive symptoms, with the CES-D score rising from 5.0 to 24.0, a change that is statistically significant and suggests a marked increase in the burden of depressive symptoms. Concurrently, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, has also increased from 38.0 to 47.0. While self-esteem has shown a slight decrease, the change is minimal and not statistically significant. Interpersonal trust remains stable, as does the reported level of happiness, despite the increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety.

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant reports an increased frequency of alcohol consumption (beer), moving from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a month."" Exercise habits have seen a notable shift, with a significant decrease in exercising with others, from ""1-2 times a week"" to ""Not at all,"" while the frequency of sports participation has remained stable. Daily recreational habits also show changes; there is a decrease in time spent on internet usage and socializing with friends, and a notable increase in listening to music. The time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games has decreased.

Physiologically, there are shifts in the participant's circadian rhythm and heart rate patterns. The mesor and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm have decreased, suggesting a reduction in the overall daily range of heart rate variability. The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, has shifted slightly later in the day. The resting heart rate has increased by 2.0 bpm, although this change is not statistically significant. Sleep statistics reveal an increase in median sleep duration by 49 minutes, with a corresponding decrease in the standard deviation of sleep duration, suggesting more consistent, albeit longer, sleep. The median sleep start time has also shifted slightly later.

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

The analysis of the provided data suggests a concerning trend towards increased perceived stress. The most significant indicators pointing in this direction are the substantial increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D score delta of 19.0, Z-score delta of 2.24) and the rise in trait anxiety (STAI score delta of 9.0, Z-score delta of 1.4). These psychological shifts, particularly the marked increase in depressive symptoms, are strongly indicative of heightened psychological distress, which is a core component of perceived stress.

While some behavioral changes, such as increased beer consumption and a reduction in social interaction, could be interpreted as coping mechanisms potentially related to stress, they do not necessarily ameliorate stress and can sometimes exacerbate it. The physiological data shows a slight increase in resting heart rate and some alterations in circadian rhythm parameters, which, while not definitively indicative of stress on their own, do not contradict the notion of increased physiological arousal or dysregulation. The increase in sleep duration, while potentially positive, might also be a symptom of withdrawal or reduced engagement in activities, consistent with increased depressive symptoms.

The initial PSS score of 20.0, which was slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.44), suggests a baseline that was not exceptionally high. However, the correlation of the initial PSS score with the change in PSS (-0.56) indicates that individuals who initially reported lower stress were more likely to experience an increase in stress over time. Given the significant increases in validated measures of depression and anxiety, and the absence of strong counterbalancing positive changes, the evidence leans towards a worsening of perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, have significantly decreased from a state of ""anxious"" (previous score 43.0, Z-score 0.17) to ""not anxious"" (current score 33.0, Z-score -0.7). This substantial reduction of 10 points, with a Z-score of change of -1.04, is associated with a weak positive correlation (-0.18) with changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores. Concurrently, self-reported happiness has declined by 1 point (Score Delta of -1.0), moving from a positive to a negative Z-score of change (-0.96), and this decrease exhibits a moderate negative correlation (-0.14) with PSS changes. While self-esteem has seen a slight increase of 4 points (Score Delta 4.0, Z-score of Delta 0.76), its correlation with PSS change is negligible (-0.05). Health satisfaction has also decreased by -0.78 (Z-score of Delta -0.77), with a slight negative correlation (-0.04) to PSS change. The CES-D score for depressive symptoms has increased by 3 points (Z-score of Delta 0.47), though it remains in the ""not depressed"" classification and shows a weak positive correlation (0.26) with PSS change.

In terms of behavioral habits, there has been a notable increase in substance usage. The participant now reports consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, a significant shift from ""Not at all"" previously. These increases are reflected in substantial positive Z-scores of delta for both beer (2.62) and wine/liquor (2.71), with weak negative and positive correlations to PSS change respectively. Physical activity has seen a mixed pattern; while exercising alone and with others has remained consistent, engagement in ""Sports"" has decreased from 1-2 times a week to ""Not at all,"" a change with a Z-score of delta of -1.85 and a negative correlation (-0.0) with PSS change. Recreational habits show an increase in video game time by 1 hour (Z-score of delta 0.64) and a considerable increase in listening to music, from 16-30 minutes to 2-3 hours (Z-score of delta 1.57). Reading has also been initiated, with 15 minutes or less of reading per day (Z-score of delta 0.60).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm regularity has improved significantly. Interdaily Stability has increased substantially by 0.28 (Z-score of Delta 2.11), and autocorrelation at 24 hours has increased by 0.17 (Z-score of Delta 1.06), both showing positive correlations with PSS change. Conversely, Intradaily Variability has decreased slightly by -0.05 (Z-score of Delta -0.58), with a weak positive correlation to PSS change. The MESOR, reflecting the midpoint of the heart rate rhythm, has slightly decreased by -1.83 (Z-score of Delta -0.17). The amplitude, representing the range of the heart rate rhythm, has increased by 2.81 (Z-score of Delta 0.95). Resting heart rate has remained stable with a minor increase of 0.2 (Z-score of Delta 0.08). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals generally higher mean heart rates during nighttime hours (12 AM - 6 AM) in the current period compared to the previous, suggesting a potential disruption in the typical resting pattern. Specifically, the 12 AM - 1 AM hour shows a notable increase from 79.54 to 82.85, and similarly, the 10 PM - 11 PM hour has increased from 87.58 to 92.27. Conversely, daytime hours, particularly in the afternoon, often show lower mean heart rates in the current period, such as the 3-4 PM hour decreasing from 84.64 to 85.19 (a slight increase, but overall trend in afternoon is lower). Sleep duration has decreased by approximately 23 minutes (Z-score of Delta -0.61) and sleep latency has increased by 20 minutes (Z-score of Delta 1.04), indicating a trend towards shorter and potentially more difficult sleep. The standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased significantly by -55 minutes (Z-score of Delta -1.21), suggesting more consistent, albeit shorter, sleep durations. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 48 minutes (Z-score of Delta 0.88).

## Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for the worsening of perceived stress is suggested by the increase in substance usage (beer and wine/liquor), a decrease in sports engagement, a reduction in overall sleep duration, and an increase in sleep latency. Furthermore, the observed increase in mean heart rate during late night/early morning hours and the shift towards later sleep onset times may indicate physiological strain. The decrease in self-reported happiness, despite a reduction in anxiety, and a slight increase in depressive symptoms (CES-D) also point towards potential increases in stress. The moderate negative correlation of happiness changes with PSS changes and the weak positive correlation of CES-D changes with PSS changes further support this direction.

Conversely, evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress includes a significant reduction in self-reported anxiety (STAI) and an increase in self-esteem. The increased interdaily stability and autocorrelation in heart rate data suggest improved circadian rhythm regulation, which can be protective against stress. The decrease in sleep duration standard deviation implies more consistent sleep patterns, which can contribute to stress stability.

Holistically analyzing these findings, the increased substance usage, reduced sleep quality and quantity, and the decline in self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are more indicative of an overall increase in perceived stress, despite the notable reduction in anxiety. The positive correlations between changes in some of these indicators (e.g., CES-D) and PSS change further support this conclusion.

77789,2.0,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits notable shifts in several self-reported psychological and behavioral indicators between the two measurement periods. A significant improvement is observed in depressive symptoms, as indicated by a substantial decrease in the CES-D score (delta of -7.0). Concurrently, health satisfaction has markedly increased, with a delta of 1.22, suggesting a more positive outlook on their physical well-being. Conversely, self-reported happiness has decreased by 1.0 point, a change that, while not as large in absolute terms as the CES-D improvement, represents a significant Z-score change (-0.96). Self-esteem shows a modest increase (delta of 3.0), which is a positive trend, albeit with a less pronounced Z-score change. Trust levels have slightly decreased, but this change is minimal in magnitude.

Behavioral patterns also reveal shifts. Substance usage, specifically for beer, has increased from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week,"" representing a considerable increase in frequency. Alcohol (wine or liquor) usage has also increased from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" In terms of exercise, there has been a positive shift towards exercising alone, moving from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" However, engagement in sports and exercising with others remains at ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits show an increase in internet usage, progressing from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""1-2 hours,"" and a notable decrease in reading, moving from ""16-30 minutes"" to ""Do not do."" There is also an increase in watching TV/videos/movies, from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less.""

Physiological data from the wearable device indicate a decrease in resting heart rate by 7.8 bpm, which is a substantial reduction and is associated with a lower Z-score of -1.61. The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, has also decreased by 5.29 bpm. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm has increased, suggesting potentially greater daily variation in heart rate. Sleep continuity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours, has shown slight improvements. However, Intradaily Variability has shown a minor increase. The Median Sleep Start Time has shifted earlier by approximately one hour. The standard deviation of sleep duration has decreased substantially, indicating more consistent sleep durations.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

The participant exhibits a mixed pattern of changes in self-reported psychological and behavioral indicators, with some suggesting a decrease in stress and others indicating potential increases or stability. The significant decrease in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and the marked increase in health satisfaction are strong indicators of improved psychological well-being, which would typically correlate with reduced perceived stress. The improvement in sleep consistency, as evidenced by the decrease in sleep duration standard deviation, and the reduction in resting heart rate are also favorable physiological changes that could contribute to lower stress.

However, there are counteracting factors. The increase in beer and alcohol consumption represents an increase in substance use, which can be associated with higher stress. The decrease in self-reported happiness, although moderate, is concerning and contrasts with the positive changes in depression and health satisfaction. The substantial increase in internet usage and continued low engagement in social activities or sports do not strongly indicate an improvement in stress-coping behaviors. The decrease in Mesor and increase in Amplitude of heart rate rhythm, while potentially reflecting improved sleep structure in some aspects, are complex physiological changes that do not definitively point towards a reduction in overall physiological stress arousal. The initial PSS score was -0.44 standard deviations below the mean, suggesting a baseline level of stress that was not particularly high. The negative correlation of -0.56 between the initial PSS score and changes in PSS suggests that individuals with higher initial stress tended to experience greater reductions in stress.

Considering the significant improvements in depressive symptoms and health satisfaction, alongside better sleep duration consistency and a notable reduction in resting heart rate, the evidence leans towards an overall improvement or stability in perceived stress. While there are indicators such as increased substance use and decreased happiness that warrant attention, the magnitude of positive changes in core well-being indicators suggests a net beneficial shift. The substantial decrease in CES-D is particularly impactful.

The participant exhibits several notable changes across self-report, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived metrics. In terms of psychological self-report, a decrease in self-reported happiness is observed, with a Z-score of -1.8 for the change, indicating a significant decline relative to the population. Concurrently, health satisfaction has also decreased, with a Z-score of -1.38 for the change. The STAI-Trait anxiety score has increased by 3 points, resulting in a Z-score of 0.63 for the change, suggesting a slight elevation in chronic anxiety proneness. Conversely, the CES-D score, measuring depressive symptoms, has shown a modest increase with a Z-score of 0.36 for the change, but remains in the ""Not depressed"" classification. Self-esteem has slightly decreased by 2 points, with a Z-score of -0.35 for the change. Trust levels have marginally decreased by -0.17.

Behavioral habits reveal an increase in wine or liquor consumption, shifting from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week"" (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.73). There has also been an increase in time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.46) and time spent playing video games, which has transitioned from ""Do not do"" to ""15 minutes or less"" (Delta Num: 1.0, Z-Score of Delta: 0.64). Exercise habits, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports, have remained consistent.

Wearable-derived metrics indicate a notable improvement in sleep patterns. Median sleep duration has increased by 34 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.52), and the standard deviation of sleep duration has also increased by 21 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.62), suggesting a more consistent sleep schedule. The median sleep start time has shifted later by 20 minutes (Z-Score of Delta: 0.36). Circadian rhythm metrics show an increase in Interdaily Stability (Delta: 0.07, Z-Score of Delta: 0.56) and a decrease in Intradaily Variability (Delta: -0.12, Z-Score of Delta: -1.07), pointing towards a more regular and stable daily rhythm. Autocorrelation at 24 hours has also increased significantly (Delta: 0.15, Z-Score of Delta: 0.93), further supporting enhanced circadian regularity. The resting heart rate has decreased by 1.6 bpm, with a Z-score of -0.3 for the change, indicating a slight improvement in physiological recovery. The Mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours) has slightly increased by 0.47, but remains within a normal range and is associated with a low correlation to PSS changes. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, has shifted later by approximately 17 minutes. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal a general trend of higher heart rates during the night and early morning hours in the current measurement period compared to the previous one, particularly between 12 AM and 4 AM, and also in the late afternoon and early evening (4 PM - 8 PM).

Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress

Evidence for an increase in perceived stress is suggested by the observed decreases in self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, along with a slight increase in STAI-Trait anxiety scores. The modest increase in CES-D scores, while still within the ""Not depressed"" range, could also contribute to a perception of increased psychological burden.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress is indicated by the significant improvements in sleep duration and quality, as well as the increased regularity and stability of the circadian rhythm. The decrease in resting heart rate also points towards a potential reduction in physiological arousal. While self-esteem and trust have shown minor decreases, these changes are less pronounced and have weaker correlations with PSS score changes. The increase in wine or liquor consumption and time spent on passive recreational activities like watching TV/videos could be interpreted as coping mechanisms, which might temporarily alleviate or mask underlying stress. The overall Z-scores for the changes in many of these behavioral and psychological metrics, particularly the negative ones (happiness, health satisfaction), are not as extreme as some of the positive changes in sleep and circadian rhythm regularity.

Considering the multimodal data, the improvements in sleep, circadian rhythm stability, and resting heart rate suggest a potential for reduced physiological stress. However, the concurrent decline in self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, coupled with a slight increase in anxiety, are significant indicators that may outweigh the physiological improvements in terms of overall perceived stress. The negative correlation of the initial PSS score with changes (-0.56) suggests that participants who started with higher PSS scores tended to see a decrease in PSS. Given the participant's initial PSS Z-score of -0.98, they were already below the population average, and this negative correlation implies their PSS might be expected to decrease or remain stable. However, the observed self-report data (happiness, health satisfaction, anxiety) points towards an increase in perceived stress. The interpretation of ""stress direction"" requires weighing these factors. The direct negative indicators in self-reported psychological well-being are more aligned with an increase in perceived stress, despite positive physiological changes.

The participant's self-reported mental well-being shows a notable decrease in trait anxiety, with the STAI score reducing from 45.0 (indicating anxiety) to 35.0 (not anxious), a significant Z-score change of -1.04. This is accompanied by a decrease in self-reported happiness from 4.0 to 3.0, with a Z-score change of -0.96. While depressive symptoms, as measured by CES-D, remained stable within the ""not depressed"" classification, there was a slight decrease in score. Self-esteem showed a minor decrease of 1.0 point, with a negligible Z-score change. Health satisfaction also saw a slight increase in score with a near-zero Z-score change, indicating a stable perception of physical health.

Behavioral changes are evident in substance usage, with a marked increase in the frequency of consuming beer and wine or liquor from ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" to ""1-2 times a week."" This shift in substance use is mirrored by significant positive changes in exercise frequency. The participant now exercises alone ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" compared to ""Not at all"" previously, and importantly, now exercises with others ""Three times a week or more,"" a substantial increase from never exercising with others. Daily recreational habits show a slight increase in time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, while time spent on video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading remained largely unchanged or slightly decreased.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a significant improvement in the regularity of their daily rhythm. Interdaily Stability (IS) of heart rate has increased from 0.51 to 0.71 (Z-score change of 1.52), indicating a more consistent daily pattern. Similarly, the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours has increased from 0.27 to 0.53 (Z-score change of 1.67), further supporting a more robust circadian rhythm. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (IV) of heart rate has decreased from 0.42 to 0.38 (Z-score change of -0.50), suggesting less fragmented physiological activity throughout the day. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, has decreased, and the Amplitude, representing the daily variation in heart rate, has also slightly decreased. Resting heart rate has increased by 5.5 bpm (Z-score change of 1.21).

Sleep patterns indicate a substantial improvement in sleep duration. The median sleep duration has increased from 6 hours 49 minutes to 8 hours 37 minutes, representing a significant increase with a Z-score of 1.98. This is accompanied by a reduction in the standard deviation of sleep duration, suggesting more consistent sleep length. However, the median sleep start time has become earlier, from approximately 1:28 AM to 12:35 AM, with a notable Z-score of -1.02 for the change, indicating a shift in the timing of sleep onset. The standard deviation of sleep start time has also decreased, suggesting greater consistency in when sleep begins.

**Task 2: Overall Direction of Change in Perceived Stress**

Evidence suggesting a worsening of perceived stress includes the observed increase in the frequency of alcohol consumption (beer, wine or liquor) and a slight increase in resting heart rate. Additionally, the decrease in self-reported happiness, despite improvements in other psychological measures, could be a contributing factor.

Evidence for the improvement or stability of perceived stress is substantial and multifaceted. The participant demonstrates a significant reduction in trait anxiety (STAI), moving from an anxious classification to not anxious. This is a strong indicator of improved psychological well-being. Furthermore, depressive symptoms (CES-D) remained stable in the non-depressed range, and self-esteem, while slightly reduced, remains within a normal range. The most striking improvements are in behavioral and physiological regulation. The increase in interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate, along with decreased intradaily variability, signifies a more robust and stable circadian rhythm, which is generally associated with lower stress. The substantial increase in sleep duration to a healthy level, coupled with greater consistency in sleep duration and timing, is a powerful buffer against stress. The increase in exercising with others is also a positive behavioral change that can reduce stress.

Holistically, the significant reductions in anxiety, coupled with the marked improvements in sleep duration, regularity of daily rhythms, and increased social exercise, strongly suggest that the participant's overall perceived stress has improved. While an increase in alcohol consumption and resting heart rate are noted, they appear to be overshadowed by the widespread positive changes in psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains that are strongly correlated with stress reduction.
