44869,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"The participant presents with a complex interplay of self-reported psychological states and objectively measured behavioral and physiological patterns. On self-report measures, the participant exhibits low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.23) and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.26), suggesting a generally stable and positive self-perception. Interpersonal trust is also within the average range (Trust Z-score: -0.46), as is self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Perceived stress levels are moderate (Stress Z-score: -0.17). Notably, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a high PSQI score (Z-score: 1.52). This subjective sleep disturbance is accompanied by objective Fitbit data showing a longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score: 1.55) but considerable variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score: 2.09) and sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score: 1.63). The median sleep start time of approximately 1 AM, coupled with significant variability, suggests an irregular sleep schedule.

Behavioral data reveal a high amount of sedentary leisure activities, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.91) and prolonged engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score: 3.19). Conversely, the participant engages infrequently in exercise, with low frequencies for exercising alone (Z-score: -0.43) and almost no participation in exercising with others or sports (Z-scores: -1.58 and -1.09, respectively). Substance usage is reported as non-existent for alcohol and recreational drugs, which is a lower than average engagement.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a higher than average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 2.41) and a higher than average mesor, indicating a generally elevated basal cardiovascular activity. The heart rate data also shows a marked elevation in deviation from the mesor during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: 1.18, 4-5 AM Z-score: 1.21, 5-6 AM Z-score: 1.14), suggesting a period of heightened physiological arousal during what would typically be deep sleep. This pattern is further supported by higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 1.16) and lower interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.17), indicative of less predictable daily rhythms. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (5:09 PM), which is relatively typical, but the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Z-score: -0.91), suggesting a dampened diurnal variation.

Considering the significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z-score: 1.52) and the objective data indicating highly variable sleep onset and duration, alongside elevated resting heart rate and elevated arousal during early morning hours, these factors align with increased depressive symptomology. The correlation between PSQI score and CES-D is not provided, but poor sleep quality is a known correlate. While self-esteem and anxiety are within normal ranges, the presence of disturbed sleep and a sedentary lifestyle, coupled with the physiological indicators of elevated resting heart rate and disrupted circadian rhythm, suggests a potential for elevated CES-D scores.

The participant's CES-D score would likely fall in the top 50% of the study population. This conclusion is primarily driven by the pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z-score: 1.52) which, while not directly correlated with CES-D in the provided data, is a strong indicator of mental distress. This is further supported by objective measures of sleep variability (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: 2.09, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 1.63) and physiological metrics such as elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 2.41) and increased intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score: 1.16). These objective measures suggest a dysregulation that is often associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology. While the participant reports high self-esteem and low anxiety, the presence of significant sleep problems and physiological markers of stress and irregularity lean towards a higher overall burden of depressive symptoms.

92552,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"This participant exhibits several self-reported and objectively measured behavioral and physiological patterns that warrant examination in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures indicate a profile of heightened anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.37, correlation = 0.81), lower self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = 0.82, correlation = -0.71), and disturbed sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score = 0.59, classification = 'Disturbed Sleep'). While perceived stress is within the average range (PSS Z-score = -0.17), and interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Trust Z-score = -0.14), happiness is also reported as being below average (Happy Z-score = 0.55, correlation = -0.46). Health satisfaction is notably low (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -0.78, correlation = -0.39). In terms of activities, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine or Liquor Z-scores = 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and infrequent engagement in sports or exercising with others. Daily recreation predominantly involves sedentary activities such as listening to music and internet usage, with minimal time allocated to reading or outdoor recreation like watching TV/videos/movies.

Wearable data reveal a lower-than-average mesor (Mesor Z-score = -1.49, correlation = 0.19) and resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -1.11, correlation = 0.19), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a non-parametric intradaily variability that is slightly elevated (Intradaily Variability Z-score = 0.32, correlation = -0.06), while interdaily stability is slightly reduced (Interdaily Stability Z-score = -0.24, correlation = -0.0). The acrophase, indicating peak heart rate, occurs in the evening (8:48 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significant departures during the late night and early morning hours. Specifically, substantial positive deviations are observed between 1 AM and 4 AM (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score = 4.03, 3-4 AM Z-score = 2.83), followed by pronounced negative deviations during the late morning and midday (e.g., 10-11 AM Z-score = -3.25, 11 AM-12 PM Z-score = -3.45). Later in the afternoon and evening, heart rate deviations become more positive, with a peak at 6-7 PM (Z-score = 0.87). Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = 0.79), but with considerable variability (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score = 1.66). The median sleep start time is notably late (3:48 AM), with moderate variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = 0.25). The participant also takes more naps than average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = 1.75).

The participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom half of the distribution. While self-reported anxiety (STAI) and disturbed sleep (PSQI) are elevated, and self-esteem and happiness are below average, these are accompanied by a low resting heart rate and mesor, and several key behavioral patterns that do not strongly correlate with elevated depressive symptoms. Notably, the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (r = -0.71) and the positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D score (r = 0.81) are suggestive of a potential association. However, the high average sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and lack of significant engagement in high-risk activities or substance abuse do not strongly indicate severe depressive symptomatology. The participant's late sleep onset and increased napping are indicative of sleep disturbances, which can be related to depression, but also to other factors like circadian rhythm misalignment. The overall pattern, considering the mixed indicators and the absence of extreme deviations in key physiological markers and behaviors strongly associated with high depression, suggests a CES-D score that falls within the lower to median range of the study population.

73158,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported traits and behavioral metrics. Psychologically, the participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.71) and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of 1.66), which are generally indicative of positive psychological well-being. This is further supported by a high reported happiness score (Happy Z-score of 1.64). However, the participant also reports moderate perceived stress (Stress Z-score of -0.71), which is within the average range for the population, and a relatively neutral level of interpersonal trust (Trust Z-score of 0.18). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as good (PSQI Z-score of -1.26), suggesting no significant sleep disturbance.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a healthy academic profile with consistently high GPAs across multiple semesters. Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is reported as not at all. Exercise habits indicate moderate engagement in exercising alone (1-2 times a month) and frequent engagement in exercising with others (three times a week or more), while participation in sports is infrequent. Daily recreational habits show a significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours) and playing video games (16-30 minutes), which are above average for the population. Internet usage, listening to music, and reading are at the lower end of the reported time ranges or not engaged in. Socializing with friends is reported for 31 minutes to an hour, which is below average. The participant does not engage in sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, wearable data reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of -1.18), suggesting a good level of cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.16) and variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.74), suggesting a somewhat regular daily pattern. The Mesor (circadian rhythm's average value) is lower than the population average (Mesor Z-score of -1.1), and the Amplitude is slightly above average (Amplitude Z-score of 0.04). The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is at 1:01 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor during the night and early morning hours, with particularly pronounced negative deviations between 12-1 AM and 1-2 AM. Conversely, there are strong positive deviations during the morning hours, peaking between 6-7 AM, which aligns with typical wake-up patterns.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 11 minutes, which is below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -1.25). The variability in sleep duration is close to the population average, while the variability in sleep start time is below average. There are no reported daily naps.

The correlations between various metrics and CES-D scores provide additional context. Notably, higher self-esteem and happiness are correlated with lower CES-D scores (r = -0.71 and r = -0.46 respectively), as is higher interpersonal trust (r = -0.41) and health satisfaction (r = -0.39). Conversely, higher perceived stress shows a positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.28), though it is moderate. While sleep duration and quality are important for mood, the correlations with CES-D are very low in this dataset. The physiological and behavioral metrics show generally weak correlations with CES-D, with some notable exceptions. Higher Mesor and Resting Heart Rate are weakly positively correlated with CES-D, while higher Amplitude is weakly negatively correlated. Deviations from the Mesor in the late evening and early morning hours are weakly negatively correlated with CES-D, while positive deviations in the morning hours are weakly positively correlated.

Considering the overall pattern of evidence, the participant presents with several indicators of positive psychological well-being, including high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, and high reported happiness. These factors, along with good subjective sleep quality and a healthy academic profile, suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. While the shorter sleep duration and some sedentary recreational activities are noted, they do not appear to be strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology in the context of the other data. The strong positive correlations of positive psychological states (self-esteem, happiness) with lower CES-D scores are particularly compelling.

45963,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological and behavioral data with wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics to evaluate depressive symptomatology as measured by the CES-D scale. The participant reports significantly high levels of trait anxiety, with a STAI-Trait score of 62.0 (Z-score = 2.05), indicating a strong predisposition towards experiencing anxiety. This is contrasted by a relatively lower self-esteem score of 30.0 (Z-score = -1.15), suggesting a potential vulnerability. Subjective happiness is reported as low (Current = 2.0, Z-score = -1.61), and perceived stress is moderately elevated (Score = 24.0, Z-score = 0.65). Health satisfaction is also reported as low (Score = 2.56, Z-score = -1.28).

Behavioral data reveal a mixed pattern. The participant engages in moderate substance use, with wine or liquor consumption occurring 1-2 times per week (Z-score = 0.94). Exercise frequency is relatively low, particularly exercising alone (Frequency = 'Not at all', Z-score = -1.93), while participation in sports and exercising with others occurs 1-2 times per week. Daily recreation includes significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13) and moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.18) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.16). Notably, sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading are reported as ""Do not do.""

Wearable data indicates a compromised circadian rhythm, evidenced by a very low interdaily stability (Value = 0.16, Z-score = -2.06) and a low amplitude (Value = 4.2, Z-score = -2.13). The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is elevated (Value = 81.81, Z-score = 1.07), and the resting heart rate is also higher than the population average (Value = 68.2, Z-score = 1.2). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows notable deviations from the mesor, particularly during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am: -5.5, Z-score = 1.72; 4-5am: -11.79, Z-score = 1.05; 5-6am: -13.61, Z-score = 0.69). Conversely, there are higher deviations during mid-morning (e.g., 8-9am: 7.54, Z-score = 1.24). Sleep statistics reveal a relatively short median sleep duration (6 hours 40 minutes, Z-score = -0.64) and a highly variable sleep start time (Standard Deviation = 215 minutes, Z-score = 2.89), suggesting irregular sleep patterns.

Considering the elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem and happiness, moderate perceived stress, and particularly the significantly disrupted circadian rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability, low amplitude) and irregular sleep patterns (variable sleep start time, shorter sleep duration), these factors collectively suggest a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The negative correlations of STAI, Stress, and the positive correlations of happiness and health satisfaction with CES-D would further support this interpretation, although specific CES-D domain scores are not provided. The overall pattern points towards a participant experiencing more pronounced symptoms of depression.

22138,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"The participant exhibits a complex pattern of self-reported psychological traits and lifestyle behaviors. They report moderate levels of anxiety (STAI score of 50, Z-score of 0.86), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting a potential link between trait anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Conversely, their self-esteem is at a relatively good level (Score of 42, Z-Score of 0.54), and this is negatively correlated with CES-D, indicating higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI score of 5.0, Z-Score of -0.8), which is a positive indicator, although the PSQI score itself is close to the threshold for potential clinical significance. Interpersonal trust is moderately low (Score of 2.83, Z-Score of -0.78), with a negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting lower trust might be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is also on the lower end (Current score of 3.0, Z-Score of -0.53), with a negative correlation to CES-D, aligning with the expectation that lower happiness is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is at a moderate level (Score of 24.0, Z-Score of 0.65), and this is positively correlated with CES-D, indicating that higher perceived stress is associated with greater depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is moderate (Score of 3.44, Z-score of -0.62), with a negative correlation to CES-D, implying higher health satisfaction is linked to lower depressive symptoms.

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed profile. Substance usage, specifically wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-Score of 0.94), is higher than average and shows a negligible correlation with CES-D. Exercise habits are characterized by frequent social exercise (three times a week or more, Z-Score of 1.23) and no solitary exercise (Not at all, Z-Score of -1.93), with both showing minimal correlation with CES-D. Daily recreation is dominated by moderate screen time (Watching TV/Videos/Movies: 1-2 hours, Z-Score of 1.28; Internet Usage: 2-3 hours, Z-Score of 0.85), and lower engagement in activities like listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-Score of -0.72) and socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score of -0.62). Reading time falls within a moderate range (16-30 minutes, Z-Score of 1.3). Notably, internet usage shows a positive correlation with CES-D, suggesting increased internet use may be linked to higher depressive symptoms, while social interaction shows a slight negative correlation.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm metrics present a pattern of disrupted daily rhythmicity and elevated cardiovascular activity during specific periods. Interdaily stability (Value of 0.47, Z-Score of 0.5) is lower than average, indicating less regularity in daily activity patterns, which is slightly positively correlated with CES-D. Intradaily variability (Value of 0.47, Z-Score of -0.53) is also lower than average, suggesting a less dynamic fluctuation in activity throughout the day. The mesor (Mean Heart Rate) is slightly elevated (Value of 77.51, Z-Score of 0.49), and this is positively correlated with CES-D. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also higher than average (Value of 13.05, Z-Score of 0.73), with a negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (4:20 PM), a typical time. Significant deviations from the mesor are observed during nighttime hours, particularly between 1:00 AM and 6:00 AM, with the largest negative deviations occurring between 3-4 AM (Value of -21.12, Z-Score of -0.76) and 2-3 AM (Value of -16.43, Z-Score of -0.53), suggesting periods of lower cardiovascular activity during what would typically be sleep hours. Conversely, positive deviations are notable in the afternoon, with the largest being between 1-2 PM (Value of 14.85, Z-Score of 1.1) and 6-7 PM (Value of 17.25, Z-Score of 0.82), indicating elevated heart rate during these periods. Resting heart rate is within the normal range (Value of 60.6, Z-Score of 0.29) and positively correlated with CES-D. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 32 minutes (Z-Score of 0.43), which is slightly longer than average, with a relatively stable sleep duration standard deviation. However, the median sleep start time is late (01:15:39), and the sleep start time standard deviation is considerably high (Value of 121 minutes, Z-Score of 0.83), indicating significant variability in when the participant initiates sleep. The absence of napping (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-Score of -0.86) is a neutral finding.

Considering the combined evidence, several factors point towards a higher CES-D score. The positive correlations between CES-D and trait anxiety, perceived stress, internet usage, and mesor are concerning. Lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and lower health satisfaction, while negatively correlated with CES-D, suggest an underlying vulnerability. The disrupted sleep schedule, indicated by the high variability in sleep start times, and the lower interdaily stability in activity patterns are physiological markers often associated with elevated depressive symptoms. While subjective sleep quality is reported as good, objective measures of sleep timing regularity are problematic. The elevated heart rate during certain daytime and evening hours, coupled with a higher mesor and amplitude, could suggest physiological dysregulation. The low correlation of many behavioral factors with CES-D might indicate they are not primary drivers, or that their influence is mediated by other factors. However, the presence of elevated anxiety, stress, and a late, irregular sleep schedule, alongside a higher mesor and amplitude in heart rate variability, suggests a pattern consistent with more significant depressive symptomatology.

31439,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"The participant exhibits a pattern of elevated anxiety, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 49.0, which is substantially above the typical range for this measure and correlates positively with depressive symptoms. While self-esteem is within the normative range (Score: 39.0), the positive correlation with depressive symptoms suggests that lower self-esteem may be associated with higher CES-D scores in this population. Perceived stress levels are also elevated (Score: 23.0), showing a moderate positive correlation with depressive symptoms, indicating that higher perceived stress is linked to greater depressive symptomatology. Interpersonal trust is notably low (Score: 2.5), with a significant negative correlation to depressive symptoms, suggesting that reduced trust is associated with higher CES-D scores. Self-reported happiness is also below average (Score: 3.0), exhibiting a negative correlation with depressive symptoms, implying lower happiness is related to increased depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also somewhat diminished (Score: 3.67), correlating negatively with depressive symptoms.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality as measured by the PSQI (Score: 6.0), with a z-score of -0.33, indicating slightly better than average sleep quality within the population, yet the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" warrants attention. Wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 41 minutes, which is below average for the population (Z-Score: -0.61) and shows a weak negative correlation with depressive symptoms. The standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly elevated (Value: 110 minutes, Z-Score: 0.22), suggesting inconsistency in sleep length. The median sleep start time is approximately 12:39 AM, which is later than average (Z-Score for standard deviation of sleep start time is -0.35, suggesting relative consistency). Napping behavior is minimal.

Physiological data indicates a higher-than-average resting heart rate (Value: 78.2, Z-Score: 2.38) and mesor (Value: 91.39, Z-Score: 2.38), both of which show a positive correlation with depressive symptoms. This suggests that elevated cardiovascular arousal, both at rest and as a daily average, is associated with increased depressive symptomatology. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Value: 9.24, Z-Score: -0.5), with a negative correlation to depressive symptoms, indicating that a reduced diurnal variation in heart rate may be linked to higher CES-D scores. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals moderate interdaily stability (Value: 0.44, Z-Score: 0.25) and below-average intradaily variability (Value: 0.37, Z-Score: -1.24), suggesting a relatively consistent daily pattern in heart rate but with less fluctuation throughout the day. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs around 4:05 PM. Examination of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a trend of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1 AM - 6 AM), followed by a gradual increase throughout the morning and peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, with the highest positive deviations observed between 5 PM and 10 PM. These patterns, particularly the elevated resting and average heart rate, along with the lower than average sleep duration, warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a week), with minimal usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise patterns are also moderate, with solo and group exercise occurring 1-2 times a week, though participation in sports is infrequent. Daily recreation habits show significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours), which correlates positively with depressive symptoms. Internet usage is relatively low, and time spent on video games is minimal. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, with a negligible correlation to depressive symptoms. Reading time is in the lower range.

Considering the confluence of elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, higher perceived stress, low interpersonal trust, and reduced happiness, alongside below-average sleep duration and elevated resting and average heart rates, the evidence suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The positive correlations of key distress indicators (anxiety, perceived stress, lower trust, lower happiness) with depressive symptomatology, combined with physiological markers of elevated arousal and sleep disturbances, point towards a higher likelihood of the participant falling into the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

Notably, happiness is reported at a high level with a Z-score of 1.64, suggesting a positive subjective emotional state. However, perceived stress is moderately elevated with a score of 22.0 (Z-score 0.1), aligning with a slightly below average health satisfaction score of 5.33 (Z-score 0.8). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as good with a score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8), falling below the threshold commonly indicative of significant sleep disturbance.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. Substance usage is generally low, with beer consumed 1-2 times a month and wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs not at all. Exercise frequency is notably low, with exercising alone occurring less than 1-2 times a month, exercising with others not at all, and sports not at all. This is accompanied by high levels of sedentary leisure activities, including 2-3 hours of video gaming (Z-score 3.23), 2-3 hours of internet usage (Z-score 0.85), and 2-3 hours of sedentary hobbies (Z-score 2.01), alongside 1-2 hours of watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music. Socializing with friends is reported for 2-3 hours, with a near neutral Z-score of 0.95.

Wearable data reveals a largely regular circadian rhythm with good interdaily stability (Value 0.51, Z-score 0.83) and moderate intradaily variability (Value 0.59, Z-score 0.32). The mesor heart rate of 73.25 (Z-score -0.09) and resting heart rate of 60.7 (Z-score 0.3) are within typical ranges, with the mesor slightly below population average. The amplitude of 10.29 (Z-score -0.16) also suggests a moderate diurnal variation in heart rate. The acrophase, occurring at 5:17 PM, indicates the peak heart rate typically occurs in the late afternoon. Deviations from the mesor indicate a pattern of lower heart rates in the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 3-4 AM deviation -15.43, Z-score 0.14). Heart rate activity increases during the daytime, with the highest positive deviations observed in the late evening (e.g., 7-8 PM deviation 16.73, Z-score 0.91). Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is close to the population average (Z-score -0.12). However, sleep duration shows some variability (standard deviation of 58 minutes, Z-score -0.98). The median sleep start time is 1:14 AM, with some variability in start times (standard deviation of 55 minutes, Z-score -0.61). There are no reported daily naps.

Considering the self-reported high happiness, low anxiety, and good self-esteem, alongside generally good sleep quality and a stable, albeit somewhat sedentary, daily routine, the evidence does not strongly suggest elevated depressive symptomatology. The negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with CES-D score, and the positive correlation of perceived stress, while present, are not particularly strong. The lack of significant negative correlations with objective sleep or circadian rhythm measures further supports a lower burden of depressive symptoms.

Their self-reported happiness is also below average (Happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Notably, they report relatively low perceived stress (Stress score of 13.0, Z-score -2.34), which is an inverse finding to what might be expected with elevated depressive symptoms. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed, with a score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), exceeding the common threshold for clinical significance and indicating poorer subjective sleep quality.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in significant internet usage, exceeding 4 hours daily (Z-score 2.19), which is substantially higher than the population mean. Conversely, their engagement in activities such as reading, video games, and sedentary hobbies is minimal or non-existent. Exercise frequency, particularly in sports and exercising alone, is low. Their social interaction with friends is also on the lower side. Substance use is generally low, with occasional beer consumption being the most frequent. From wearable data, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated (Mesor value 79.36, Z-score 0.74; Resting Heart Rate value 64.8, Z-score 0.79), suggesting a potentially higher physiological arousal baseline. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a moderately stable daily pattern, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.51 (Z-score 0.83) and Intradaily Variability of 0.53 (Z-score -0.11). The acrophase of their heart rate rhythm is around 4:00 PM.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of generally lower than expected heart rates during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -9.68 to -18.54). As the day progresses, heart rate deviations become more positive, peaking in the early afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM, deviation 16.31; 1-2 PM, deviation 10.72) and then gradually declining into the evening. This diurnal pattern of heart rate variation is within expected ranges, though the magnitude of deviations should be considered in context of the individual's mesor and resting heart rate. Sleep duration, averaging 6 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score -0.42), falls slightly below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 108 minutes (Z-score 0.16), suggesting some variability in sleep timing. The median sleep start time is approximately midnight, with a standard deviation of 89 minutes, indicating moderate consistency in sleep initiation. There are no reported naps.

Considering the data holistically, the participant presents with a complex profile. Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and moderate anxiety, coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, are potential indicators of depressive symptomatology. The high internet usage, low engagement in other recreational activities and exercise, and slightly above average resting heart rate and mesor warrant attention. The low perceived stress is an outlier finding that might suggest a coping mechanism or a different interpretation of stress. While the sleep duration is slightly below average, the overall pattern of sleep and circadian rhythm metrics do not strongly suggest significant disruption that would definitively point towards a high CES-D score. The correlations provided, while not definitive, indicate a modest inverse relationship between self-esteem and CES-D score, and a modest positive correlation between happiness and CES-D score. Given the combination of psychological indicators (low self-esteem, low happiness, high anxiety) and sleep disturbance, while also noting the low perceived stress, the evidence leans towards a CES-D score that is likely not in the lowest range of the distribution.

84011,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with notable trends in anxiety, self-esteem, and sleep quality, all of which may be relevant to their CES-D score. The individual reports a STAI-Trait score of 44.0, which is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.27), suggesting a tendency towards chronic anxiety. This is contrasted by a relatively high self-esteem score of 33.0 (Z-score = -0.73), indicating a positive self-evaluation. The participant also reports overall health satisfaction at 5.0 (Z-score = 0.55) and perceives moderate stress levels (Score = 20.0, Z-score = -0.44). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as 6.0, which is indicative of disturbed sleep and falls slightly above the threshold for significant disturbance (Z-score = -0.33). This aligns with a substantial median sleep duration of 8 hours and 28 minutes (Z-score = 1.59), suggesting that while sleep duration is ample, its quality may be compromised. The median sleep start time is at 00:03:10, with a standard deviation of 82 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep timing.

Behavioral data reveal a pattern of moderate engagement in social activities and exercise. The participant reports exercising with others and participating in sports three times a week or more, which are relatively high frequencies (Z-scores of 1.23 and 1.58 respectively). Socializing with friends, however, is reported as only 16-30 minutes daily, a low frequency (Z-score = -1.41). Engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are within average ranges, while time spent on video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies are at lower frequencies or not engaged in. Substance usage is notably low, with no reported use of beer, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, and infrequent use of wine or liquor.

Physiological data from the wearable device indicate a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Value = 51.4, Z-score = -0.8) and a below-average mesor (Value = 63.1, Z-score = -1.48), suggesting generally lower physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals an interdaily stability of 0.35 (Z-score = -0.49), indicating a somewhat irregular daily pattern in heart rate, and an intradaily variability of 0.69 (Z-score = 1.02), suggesting a higher degree of fluctuation within the day. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is at approximately 3:54 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals particularly pronounced positive deviations in the late evening, specifically between 8 PM and 9 PM (Value = 22.05, Z-score = 2.19) and 5 PM to 6 PM (Value = 18.23, Z-score = 1.12). Conversely, significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate, are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 9 PM to 10 PM, Value = -4.29, Z-score = -2.18). This pattern of elevated heart rate in the evening and lower during the night might reflect a disruption in the typical diurnal cardiovascular pattern.

Considering the available data, the participant presents a mixed profile. The elevated anxiety, disturbed sleep quality despite long duration, and a potentially disrupted circadian rhythm with pronounced evening heart rate spikes are all factors that may correlate with higher depressive symptomatology. While self-esteem is high and substance use is low, the combination of anxious traits and potential sleep and circadian irregularities warrants careful consideration. The moderate correlation between Trust and CES-D score (-0.41), and the higher happiness score (Z-score 0.55) with a negative correlation to CES-D (-0.46) suggest potentially protective factors. However, the lack of strong positive correlations with other CES-D related factors and the presence of elevated anxiety and sleep disturbance, coupled with atypical heart rate patterns, leans towards a more symptomatic presentation.

Given the presence of elevated anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, and atypical physiological patterns including notable evening heart rate elevations, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

88008,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"This analysis integrates self-reported psychological and behavioral data with wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics for a university student. The participant reports moderate levels of trait anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score 0.66) and lower-than-average self-esteem (Score 33.0, Z-Score -0.73). Interpersonal trust is also reported at a lower than average level (Score 2.83, Z-Score -0.78), as is general health satisfaction (Score 3.33, Z-score -0.7). Happiness levels are also below average (Current 3.0, Z-Score -0.53). Perceived stress is reported at a moderate level (Score 20.0, Z-Score -0.44), with a slightly positive correlation to the CES-D score. Notably, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), which is significantly below the population average for most categories. Exercise habits are robust, with frequent participation in exercising alone and sports (three times a week or more), and moderate engagement in exercising with others. Sedentary daily recreation habits include moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with lower engagement in reading and less than 15 minutes spent on sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals a largely regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.52, Z-Score 0.91) is high, suggesting consistent daily patterns, while intradaily variability (0.3, Z-Score -1.73) is low, indicating less fluctuation within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.41, Z-Score 0.73) further supports this regularity. The participant's mesor (78.44, Z-Score 0.61) and amplitude (15.36, Z-Score 1.48) are higher than average, suggesting a higher baseline heart rate and a more pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase is reported at 5:06 PM, indicating the peak heart rate occurs in the late afternoon. The resting heart rate (55.1, Z-Score -0.36) is slightly below average. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows significant troughs in the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -21.92, 3-4 AM: -25.5, 4-5 AM: -26.06), which are substantially lower than average. Conversely, the late evening and early nighttime hours exhibit notable peaks in deviation (e.g., 7-8 PM: 19.47, 8-9 PM: 17.8), significantly higher than average.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes, which is below average (Z-Score -1.29). The standard deviation for sleep duration is also below average (68 minutes, Z-Score -0.75), suggesting consistency in this shorter sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late, at 01:13:59, with a moderate standard deviation (77 minutes, Z-Score -0.13), indicating some variability in bedtime. The PSQI score of 5.0, while classified as ""Good Sleep"" in the survey context, is at the upper limit of what is typically considered good and is only slightly below average in terms of z-score (-0.8), suggesting that subjective sleep quality is not a significant concern, despite the objectively shorter duration. The average daily nap frequency is minimal (0.08, Z-Score 0.12).

Considering the participant's self-reported lower levels of self-esteem, happiness, and trust, along with higher trait anxiety and a shorter sleep duration, these factors tend to be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. While the participant engages in frequent exercise and reports no substance abuse, which are protective factors, the constellation of psychological and sleep metrics points towards a potential for increased depressive symptomatology. The low intradaily variability in heart rate, while indicative of circadian regularity, coupled with pronounced dips in heart rate during early sleep hours and peaks in the evening, might reflect a disrupted internal rhythm that could contribute to or be a consequence of depressive symptoms. The moderate perceived stress, although not strongly correlated with CES-D, adds to the overall picture of potential psychological strain.

83566,37.0,0.9715025906735751,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may inform an understanding of their current depressive symptomology. Self-report data indicates a notable elevation in anxiety proneness, as evidenced by a STAI-Trait score of 62.0, placing them two standard deviations above the mean (Z-score = 2.05). This is further corroborated by a strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI scores and CES-D. Conversely, self-esteem is considerably lower than average, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 29.0 (Z-score = -1.29), and a moderate negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, suggesting that lower self-worth is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Happiness is also reported at a low level, with a Z-score of -1.61, and a negative correlation of -0.45 with CES-D. Perceived stress is moderately elevated at 24.0 (Z-score = 0.65), with a positive correlation of 0.28 with CES-D, indicating that higher perceived stress is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Score = 8.0, Z-score = 0.59), with a positive correlation (though not provided, implied by classification) with CES-D, suggesting poorer sleep quality is associated with more severe depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is close to the population mean (Score = 3.33, Z-score = 0.18), with a weak negative correlation (-0.41) with CES-D.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in minimal substance use and limited social exercise. They report not consuming alcohol, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, with most categories showing negative Z-scores. Exercise frequency is low, with infrequent solitary exercise (1-2 times a month, Z-score = -0.43) and no reported exercise with others (Z-score = -1.58) or participation in sports (Z-score = -1.09). Daily recreational habits are also characterized by low engagement in active pursuits; while internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.18), time spent listening to music is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-score = -0.72). Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score = -0.62), and they do not engage in watching TV/videos/movies or reading, with negative Z-scores for these activities.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data from wearable devices present a mixed picture. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated, with a value of 69.4 bpm (Z-score = 1.34), which shows a moderate positive correlation (0.18) with CES-D. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the circadian cycle, is also elevated at 84.83 bpm (Z-score = 1.49), with a positive correlation (0.18) with CES-D. The overall circadian rhythm exhibits moderate stability, with an interdaily stability of 0.42 (Z-score = 0.09) and intradaily variability of 0.58 (Z-score = 0.24). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is high at 0.43 (Z-score = 0.9), suggesting a relatively robust daily rhythm. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate periods of lower-than-average cardiovascular activity during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 am, Z-score = 0.37, deviation = -15.87) and a more pronounced peak in deviation during the late afternoon (2-3 pm, Z-score = 0.84, deviation = 11.57). Sleep duration is notably longer than average, with a median of 8 hours and 8 minutes (Z-score = 1.18) and a negative correlation (-0.02) with CES-D, suggesting longer sleep is not associated with higher depressive symptoms. Sleep start time is later than average, with a median start time of 01:52:00 and a standard deviation in sleep start time of 66 minutes (Z-score = -0.37), indicating some irregularity in sleep timing.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant's elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and perceived stress, alongside poorer subjective sleep quality and a higher resting and mesor heart rate, are all associated with increased depressive symptomatology. While sleep duration is longer than average and substance use and social exercise are low, these factors do not strongly mitigate the indicators of distress. The significant elevation in anxiety and low self-esteem, coupled with a relatively high CES-D population mean, suggests that the participant's symptom burden is likely to be in the upper half of the distribution.

87032,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"This participant presents with a profile characterized by heightened anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and significant sleep disturbances. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 44.0, with a Z-score of 0.27, suggests a proneness to anxiety. This is congruent with a Self-Esteem score of 36.0 (Z-score: -0.31), indicating lower than average self-worth. The participant's subjective sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), is notably poor, with a score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52), classifying as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This is further substantiated by wearable data, which reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes (Z-score: -0.58), indicating shorter than average sleep. Moreover, the median sleep start time is unusually late at 02:00:29, with a standard deviation of 145 minutes (Z-score: 1.36), suggesting significant irregularity in sleep timing. The presence of a mean of 0.18 daily naps (Z-score: 1.27) may be compensatory for insufficient nighttime sleep.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a higher than average resting heart rate of 69.4 bpm (Z-score: 1.34) and a mesor (midline estimating rhythm) of 85.35 bpm (Z-score: 1.56), suggesting a generally elevated physiological arousal level. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a low interdaily stability (Value: 0.27, Z-score: -1.15) and high intradaily variability (Value: 0.75, Z-score: 1.44) in heart rate, indicating a disrupted and irregular daily rhythmicity. This pattern of irregular sleep and elevated physiological arousal, coupled with subjective reports of anxiety and low self-esteem, is suggestive of potential depressive symptomatology.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in a substantial amount of sedentary activities. They report spending 2-3 hours watching TV/Videos/Movies (Z-score: 1.91), over 4 hours on the internet (Z-score: 2.19), and over 4 hours listening to music (Z-score: 2.06). Additionally, reading time is reported as 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score: 2.28), and sedentary hobbies occupy 1-2 hours (Z-score: 1.41). Notably, there is a complete absence of exercising alone, exercising with others, or participating in sports. While socializing with friends is reported at 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.16), the overall profile leans heavily towards passive and solitary activities. The correlation data, while not definitive, shows weak to moderate negative correlations between self-esteem and CES-D score (-0.71), and between happiness and CES-D score (-0.46), suggesting that lower self-esteem and happiness are associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, higher perceived stress (Score: 26.0, Z-score: 1.19, Correlation: 0.28) shows a positive correlation with CES-D score.

Considering the cumulative evidence from self-report measures of anxiety, low self-esteem, and disturbed sleep, alongside physiological indicators of irregular circadian rhythms and elevated arousal, and a behavioral profile dominated by sedentary activities with a lack of physical engagement, it is highly probable that this participant exhibits a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The strong negative correlations between self-esteem and happiness with the CES-D score, coupled with a positive correlation for perceived stress, further supports this conclusion. The objectively measured irregular sleep patterns and high intradaily variability in heart rate are also consistent with indicators of depression.

94641,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful consideration in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-reported data reveals elevated levels of trait anxiety (STAI score: 54.0, Z-score: 1.25), suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety. Conversely, self-esteem is moderately low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: 32.0, Z-score: -0.87), with a notable negative correlation to depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is within the average range (PSS score: 23.0, Z-score: 0.38), yet its positive correlation with depressive symptoms suggests that even moderate levels of stress could be contributing to elevated CES-D scores. Subjective sleep quality is significantly compromised, as indicated by a high PSQI score (10.0, Z-score: 1.52) classifying sleep as disturbed, and this metric shows a strong positive correlation with depressive symptoms. The participant reports lower than average satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction score: 2.11, Z-score: -1.61), which also exhibits a negative correlation with CES-D scores. Interpersonal trust is also lower than average (Trust score: 2.83, Z-score: -0.78), with a moderate negative correlation. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Current Happiness score: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55), but its moderate negative correlation suggests that improvements in happiness would be associated with lower depressive symptoms.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in minimal substance use and no recreational drugs. However, there is a conspicuous absence of structured exercise, with reported frequencies of 'Not at all' for exercising alone, with others, and for sports, all of which have substantially negative Z-scores. This lack of physical activity is further complemented by sedentary leisure pursuits, characterized by extensive engagement in video games (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47) and listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06), alongside significant time spent on sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 3.19). Conversely, social interaction with friends is reported as minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -2.2), which exhibits a non-significant correlation with depressive symptoms. Internet usage falls within the average range.

Wearable-derived data indicates disruptions in physiological regulation and sleep patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated (Value: 70.3, Z-score: 1.44), and their Mesor (average heart rate over the day) is also higher than the population mean (Value: 83.09, Z-score: 1.25). The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:49 PM). The circadian rhythm metrics reveal relatively low interdaily stability (Value: 0.42, Z-score: 0.09), suggesting a lack of regularity in daily physiological patterns, which correlates neutrally with CES-D. Intradaily variability is lower than average (Value: 0.47, Z-score: -0.53), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate within a day, but this metric shows a slight negative correlation. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration that is notably shorter than average (6 hours 15 minutes, Z-score: -1.15), with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (168 minutes, Z-score: 1.52), indicative of inconsistent sleep. The median sleep start time is late (00:29:59) with a moderate standard deviation. The participant also reports a significant number of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.3, Z-score: 2.66), a metric strongly correlated with depressive symptoms. Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows pronounced deviations from the mesor during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM, with values around -13% and -15% respectively. These periods of significantly lower heart rate during what would typically be a time of restorative sleep may reflect disruptions in sleep architecture or insufficient sleep drive. The acrophase at 4:49 PM suggests a later peak in physiological activity, which may contribute to later sleep onset.

Considering the convergence of several indicators, the participant demonstrates patterns consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The presence of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, and low health satisfaction, all of which show concerning correlations with depressive symptoms, are significant. The lack of physical activity and extensive sedentary behavior, particularly excessive video game and music listening time, alongside minimal social engagement, are also commonly observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the wearable data highlights objectively poor sleep duration and high variability in sleep, a significantly elevated resting heart rate, and a disrupted circadian rhythm indicated by low interdaily stability and frequent napping. The strong positive correlation between disturbed sleep (PSQI) and naps with CES-D, and the negative correlations for self-esteem and health satisfaction, further strengthen the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. While some self-reported measures like happiness are not strongly indicative of high depression, the aggregate of negative indicators points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

82728,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with several indicators that warrant detailed examination in relation to their CES-D score. Self-report data indicate generally low anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score = -0.23) and relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -0.17), which are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Their academic performance is exceptionally high, with a consistent 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters. However, subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI Score = 7.0, Z-score = 0.13), with a score above 5 often indicating clinically significant issues. This aligns with a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours, which is within a typical range, but the accompanying standard deviation of sleep duration (92 minutes, Z-score = -0.21) suggests some variability. The median sleep start time is around 1:05 AM, with a standard deviation of 93 minutes, indicating a somewhat irregular sleep schedule, particularly given the relatively early acrophase of heart rate variability (4:54 PM).

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a moderately elevated mesor (76.53, Z-score = 0.35) and a significantly high amplitude (15.56, Z-score = 1.54) in their heart rate rhythm, suggesting a robust diurnal variation in cardiovascular activity, with a peak occurring in the late afternoon. The resting heart rate is also slightly elevated (60.2, Z-score = 0.24). Analysis of the hourly deviation from the mesor indicates periods of reduced physiological arousal during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM deviation = -16.52, Z-score = -0.55) and a pronounced increase in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and early evening, with the highest positive deviation observed between 5-6 PM (27.42, Z-score = 2.47). This pattern suggests a marked diurnal fluctuation in heart rate, potentially reflecting a robust activity cycle, though the acrophase being in the late afternoon could also be indicative of delayed sleep phase tendencies. The interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (0.5, Z-score = 0.75), while intradaily variability is relatively low (0.47, Z-score = -0.53), suggesting a consistent daily rhythm but less pronounced beat-to-beat fluctuations.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular exercise, reporting exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score = 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.53). Substance usage is reported as ""not at all"" for beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs. Daily recreation habits are characterized by limited engagement with passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score = -0.62) and video games (do not do, Z-score = -0.56), and moderate internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score = -1.16). They also report listening to music for 15 minutes or less (Z-score = -0.72) and socializing with friends for 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score = -0.62). Notably, they do not engage in reading (Z-score = -0.67) or other sedentary hobbies for more than 16-30 minutes (Z-score = 0.23). The lack of substance use and high levels of physical activity are generally protective factors against depressive symptoms. However, the relatively low scores on happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.45), along with the disturbed sleep indicated by the PSQI, are noteworthy. The positive correlation between stress scores and CES-D (0.28) alongside the negative correlation for self-esteem and CES-D (-0.71) and trust and CES-D (-0.41) suggest that higher stress and lower self-esteem/trust would contribute to higher CES-D scores. While the participant's self-esteem and trust scores are not extremely low, their happiness and health satisfaction scores are below average for the population, which warrants consideration. The observed high amplitude in heart rate and pronounced late-afternoon peak could reflect a dysregulated circadian system, which is often associated with mood disturbances.

Considering the participant's profile, the presence of disturbed sleep, lower-than-average happiness and health satisfaction, and a tendency towards a higher amplitude in their heart rate rhythm, alongside the moderate correlations between these factors and depressive symptoms, suggests a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology. While self-reported anxiety and self-esteem are not indicative of severe depression, the combination of physiological and subjective well-being measures leans towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms, likely placing them in the top half of the CES-D distribution.

The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators, some of which show a notable correlation with depressive symptomatology as measured by the CES-D scale. In terms of self-reported traits, the participant reports significantly higher perceived stress (PSS score of 29.0, Z-score of 2.01), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.28). Conversely, self-reported happiness is relatively low (Z-score of -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.46), suggesting that lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. While self-esteem is reported to be high (Z-score of 1.38), this is negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), indicating that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI, is within the average range (Z-score of 0.27) but shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81), implying that higher anxiety is closely linked to elevated depressive symptoms in this individual. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.33), though this metric has a very weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.0). Health satisfaction is relatively low (Z-score of -0.95), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.39).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in substantial physical activity, with frequent participation in exercising alone, with others, and in sports (all reporting ""Three times a week or more"" with positive Z-scores ranging from 1.07 to 1.58). These activities are negatively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting a potential protective effect. Notably, the participant reports spending considerable time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours daily, Z-score of 1.28) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours daily, Z-score of 0.16). Conversely, internet usage is very low (15 minutes or less, Z-score of -1.83) and is positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.25), which is an interesting finding given the general association of high internet usage with negative outcomes. Substance usage is generally low, with the exception of wine or liquor consumed ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score of 0.94), though these specific substance usage patterns show negligible correlations with CES-D.

Physiologically, circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data indicate moderate stability. Interdaily stability is relatively low (Value of 0.32, Z-score of -0.74), suggesting some irregularity in daily patterns. Intradaily variability is within the average range (Value of 0.59, Z-score of 0.32). The MESOR (circadian rhythm average) is slightly below average (Value of 70.34, Z-score of -0.49) and the amplitude is also below average (Value of 9.42, Z-score of -0.44). The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:14 PM). Resting heart rate is within the normal range (Value of 57.8, Z-score of -0.04). Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. There are marked elevations in heart rate deviations during the late afternoon (e.g., 3-4 PM with a Z-score of 1.48 and 4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.40), suggesting heightened physiological arousal during these periods. Conversely, the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM and 2-3 AM) show the largest negative deviations from the mesor, indicating periods of reduced physiological activity. Sleep duration is slightly above average (Median duration of 7 hours 38 minutes, Z-score of 0.56) and shows a weak negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.0), suggesting that longer sleep may be associated with marginally lower depressive symptoms. Sleep start times are generally late, with a median start time of 00:57.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the provided data, several indicators suggest a likelihood of the participant experiencing elevated depressive symptoms, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population. The significant elevation in perceived stress (PSS score, Z=2.01) and the strong positive correlation between anxiety (STAI, correlation=0.81) and CES-D scores are key indicators of a higher symptom burden. Conversely, while self-esteem is high (Z=1.38), its strong negative correlation with CES-D (correlation=-0.71) implies that this high self-esteem may be protective and mitigate depressive symptoms. The relatively low self-reported happiness (Z=-0.53) and lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.95) are also consistent with a more significant symptom load.

Behavioral patterns present a mixed picture. The high frequency of exercise, particularly with others, and socializing with friends are generally considered protective factors and are negatively correlated with CES-D, potentially moderating symptom severity. However, the significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z=1.28) and the exceptionally low internet usage (Z=-1.83) coupled with a positive correlation to CES-D (0.28) are noteworthy. Physiologically, the elevated heart rate deviations during the late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z=2.40) could reflect physiological responses associated with stress or rumination. The low interdaily stability of heart rate (Z=-0.74) suggests a less structured daily physiological rhythm, which can be associated with mood disturbances.

Considering the strong positive correlation of anxiety with CES-D, the elevated perceived stress, and the lower self-reported happiness, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While protective factors like exercise and high self-esteem are present, the indicators of distress are compelling. Therefore, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

44872,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral metrics that warrant detailed analysis in relation to depressive symptomatology as measured by the CES-D scale. Self-reported data reveal generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.23) and a high level of self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.68), which are typically inversely associated with depressive symptoms. However, the participant reports significantly higher than average happiness (CES-D correlation: -0.46) with a Z-score of 1.64, suggesting a potential discrepancy between cognitive self-assessment of well-being and other measures. Perceived stress levels are slightly above the population average (PSS Z-score: 0.38), with a positive correlation to CES-D (0.28), indicating that higher perceived stress is associated with higher depressive symptom scores. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score: -0.33, Classification: 'Disturbed Sleep'), which is a common correlate of depression, despite a median sleep duration close to the population average (Z-score: -0.27).

Behavioral habits present a mixed picture. The participant engages in frequent alcohol consumption (Beer Z-score: 1.72; Wine or Liquor Z-score: 1.68), with low correlations to CES-D (-0.05 and -0.02 respectively), suggesting this behavior is not strongly tied to depressive symptoms in this dataset. Conversely, the participant exercises with moderate to high frequency (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07; Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23), which are negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.08 and -0.23), aligning with the protective effects of physical activity. Sedentary behaviors, such as watching TV, video games, and internet usage, are generally low to moderate, with some, like internet usage (Z-score: -1.16), being less frequent than the population average. Notably, social interaction with friends is reported as substantial (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95), with a near-zero correlation to CES-D (-0.01), indicating this positive social engagement is not directly associated with depressive symptom levels in this individual.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data from the wearable device provide further insights. The participant's overall circadian rhythm stability is low (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.99, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: -1.37), suggesting a less structured daily routine. The Mesor (average heart rate) is notably low (Z-score: -1.65), and the resting heart rate is also below the population average (Z-score: -1.17), which might indicate a generally lower physiological arousal state. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant patterns. There are pronounced periods of lower than average heart rate during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1am Z-score: -1.66, 3-4am Z-score: -0.6), followed by substantial elevations during late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11am Z-score: 3.08, 12-1pm Z-score: 3.23), and another peak in the early evening (5-6pm Z-score: 3.2). These sharp diurnal fluctuations and dips in heart rate could reflect a disrupted sleep-wake cycle or variations in activity and arousal. Sleep start time variability is high (Z-score: 1.55), contributing to a less regular sleep schedule. The combination of disturbed subjective sleep quality, low circadian rhythm stability, and significant diurnal heart rate fluctuations, alongside moderately high perceived stress, points towards factors that could contribute to elevated depressive symptoms, despite positive self-reports of anxiety and self-esteem.

The participant's CES-D score is likely to fall within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively elevated depressive symptomatology. While self-reported anxiety is low and self-esteem is high, these measures do not fully capture the nuances of mood. The notable indicator of disturbed sleep, as per the PSQI, coupled with significant variability in sleep start times (high Z-score), suggests a foundational issue that frequently co-occurs with depression. Furthermore, the wearable data highlights a significantly disrupted circadian rhythm, characterized by low interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours, alongside pronounced diurnal fluctuations in heart rate. These physiological irregularities can be indicative of an underlying mood dysregulation. The positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D score, alongside a Z-score indicating slightly above average stress, further supports the potential for elevated depressive symptoms. While frequent alcohol consumption and exercise are present, their correlations to CES-D are minimal and do not strongly mitigate the other indicators. The high level of reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64) presents a counterpoint, but the combination of disturbed sleep, circadian dysregulation, and higher perceived stress, all of which have documented links to depressive symptoms, outweighs the positive self-assessments for the purpose of this classification. The presence of a relatively low Mesor and resting heart rate may also be indicative of a blunted physiological response, which can be associated with depression.

27306,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful consideration in relation to depressive symptomology. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.43) and moderate happiness (Z-score: -0.53), with a notable strength in self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66). However, their health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score: 1.8), potentially reflecting a positive outlook on their physical well-being. Substance use is reported as infrequent, with recreational drug and non-prescribed drug use being entirely absent. The participant demonstrates a strong engagement in physical activity, with consistent exercise frequency both alone and with others (Z-scores: 1.07 and 1.23, respectively), though sports participation is notably low (Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreation habits reveal very limited engagement in screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -1.25) and internet usage (Z-score: -1.83), with no reported time spent playing video games or listening to music. Time spent socializing with friends is also moderate (Z-score: -0.62), and sedentary hobbies are not engaged in.

Wearable data reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.42), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal level at rest. The mesor, a measure of the circadian rhythm's central tendency, is also notably low (Z-score: -1.49), further indicating a potentially lower baseline physiological activity. Sleep patterns are characterized by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes, which is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.6), and a relatively consistent sleep start time (standard deviation of 57 minutes, Z-score: -0.57), suggesting some regularity in sleep timing. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.24) and intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.32), are within a moderate range, suggesting a somewhat regular, but not exceptionally robust, daily physiological rhythm. The hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor highlights significant periods of lower-than-average cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with Z-scores as low as -2.68). Conversely, there are striking peaks in heart rate deviation during the mid-morning (7-9 AM, with Z-scores up to 5.17) and late afternoon (4-5 PM, with Z-score of 7.8), indicative of periods of heightened physiological arousal during these times. These patterns suggest a distinct diurnal variation in physiological activity, with significant dips during sleep and marked increases during waking hours.

Considering the multimodal data, the participant's generally positive self-reported psychological traits (high self-esteem, low anxiety, moderate happiness) and engagement in regular exercise, alongside a relatively structured sleep schedule, might suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. However, the consistently low mesor and resting heart rate, coupled with significant dips in heart rate during the night, could indicate a state of physiological under-arousal or reduced vitality, which can be associated with depressive states. The notable absence of certain recreational activities, while potentially reflecting a focus on exercise, could also indicate a lack of engagement in activities that typically provide pleasure or distraction. The significant physiological arousal peaks during the day, particularly in the afternoon, could be indicative of stress or an attempt to compensate for periods of lower energy, which can be a feature of depression. The PSQI score of 4.0, classified as ""Good Sleep,"" is in the lower range of scores, suggesting good subjective sleep quality. Despite these positive indicators, the overall pattern of low physiological arousal during rest and sleep, contrasted with pronounced daytime peaks, warrants consideration. Given the CES-D population statistics (Mean: 13.33, 50th percentile: 11.5), the provided data does not include a direct CES-D score for this participant. However, by synthesizing the available information, particularly the mixed signals of self-reported well-being and physiological patterns, and acknowledging the absence of a direct CES-D score to correlate with, a definitive placement within the top or bottom 50% is challenging without further direct CES-D data. The data suggests a complex interplay between psychological states and physiological functioning, but without the CES-D score itself, a conclusive determination is not possible based solely on the provided metrics and their correlations.

46365,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"The participant presents with a complex profile of self-reported traits and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics. Notably, elevated trait anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 45.0 (Z-score = 0.37), is a prominent feature. This is juxtaposed with a high level of self-esteem, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 40.0 (Z-score = 0.26), representing the maximum possible score. Subjective well-being appears moderate, with a happiness score of 3.0 (Z-score = -0.53) and perceived stress of 20.0 (Z-score = -0.44), both indicating lower than average perceived stress and happiness, though not extreme. Interpersonal trust is also reported as moderately low, with a score of 3.0 (Z-score = -0.46). Health satisfaction is notably low, with a score of 2.33 (Z-score = -1.45), suggesting dissatisfaction with physical health. Sleep quality, according to the PSQI, is rated as good with a score of 5.0 (Z-score = -0.8), which is below the threshold for common clinical disturbance. Substance usage of beer is significantly high, occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score = 1.72), while wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is infrequent. Physical activity levels indicate moderate engagement in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.91), but infrequent solo or group exercise. Daily recreation habits are characterized by extensive internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-score = 2.19) and substantial socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score = 2.53), alongside minimal engagement in activities like watching TV, video games, reading, and listening to music.

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as suggested by a moderate interdaily stability (Value = 0.3, Z-score = -0.9) and low intradaily variability (Value = 0.36, Z-score = -1.31). The mesor, representing the average heart rate rhythm, is slightly elevated (Value = 77.13, Z-score = 0.43), aligning with a resting heart rate of 55.8 (Z-score = -0.28), which is within a healthy range but on the lower side. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon/early evening at 6:09 PM. Deviations from the mesor in hourly heart rate data reveal a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM show significant negative deviations) and higher than average heart rate during the late evening and early morning transition (e.g., 12-1 AM and 11-12 AM show positive deviations). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score = 0.11), which is close to the population average. However, the median sleep start time is late at 01:34:00, with a standard deviation of 62 minutes, suggesting some variability in sleep onset. There is a notable tendency for naps (Mean Daily Naps = 0.17, Z-score = 1.09), indicating a higher than average frequency of napping.

Considering the CES-D population statistics, the median CES-D score is 11.0 and the 75th percentile is 18.0. The participant's high STAI score (0.37 Z-score) and significant beer consumption (1.72 Z-score) suggest potential indicators for higher depressive symptomatology. The strong positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D scores (0.81) further supports this. Conversely, high self-esteem (0.26 Z-score) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0, -0.8 Z-score) are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. The correlations for self-esteem (-0.71) and PSQI (-0.8) with CES-D, though not provided in the JSON, are generally expected to be negative. The lower than average happiness (-0.53 Z-score) and moderate trust (-0.46 Z-score) are neutral indicators. The robust social engagement (""Socializing with Friends"": more than 4 hours, Z-score = 2.53) is a protective factor, despite the high internet usage (2.19 Z-score). The low health satisfaction (-1.45 Z-score) is a potential concern but its direct correlation with CES-D is not provided. The wearable metrics do not strongly point towards elevated depressive symptoms; the circadian rhythm parameters are relatively stable, and sleep duration is average. While the late sleep start time and increased napping are noteworthy, their individual correlations with CES-D are not explicitly stated to be strong. However, the elevated trait anxiety and substantial substance use, combined with the strong correlation of anxiety with depression, tilt the balance towards a higher symptom burden.

23287,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"This participant exhibits several noteworthy psychological and behavioral characteristics. Self-report measures indicate a low level of anxiety proneness (STAI, Z-score = -0.43) and relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem, Z-score = -0.03), aligning with a positive self-perception. Happiness levels are also reported as moderate to high (Happy, Z-score = -0.53). Perceived stress is relatively low (Stress, Z-score = -0.98), and overall health satisfaction is notably high (Health Satisfaction, Z-score = 1.71), suggesting a generally positive outlook on well-being. Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI, Z-score = -1.72), which is consistent with the self-reported positive affect. Interpersonal trust is moderately high (Trust, Z-score = 0.83).

In terms of behavioral habits, this participant reports no substance usage and limited engagement in sedentary leisure activities like watching TV/videos or playing video games. They do not engage in reading for extended periods, but rather for 15 minutes or less. Internet usage is relatively high, with 3-4 hours per day, while listening to music, socializing with friends, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as not occurring. Exercise habits show a mixed pattern: they exercise alone 1-2 times a week and with others three times a week or more, but participate in sports less than 1-2 times a month. This suggests a balanced approach to physical activity, with a stronger emphasis on social exercise.

Wearable data reveals several physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. The participant's mesor (average heart rate across the 24-hour cycle) is notably low (Mesor, Z-score = -2.2), and their resting heart rate is also significantly low (Resting Heart Rate, Z-score = -2.09), both below the population average. This indicates a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The circadian rhythm exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability, Z-score = 0.33) and intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability, Z-score = 0.57), suggesting a relatively structured daily rhythm in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs around 5:03 PM. Mean aggregate deviation from the mesor analysis of hourly heart rate data shows distinct patterns. Notably, during nighttime hours (approximately 1 AM to 7 AM), there are significant negative deviations, indicating heart rate levels considerably below the daily average, likely reflecting periods of rest and sleep. Conversely, later afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 4-5 PM, 9-11 PM) exhibit substantial positive deviations, suggesting periods of increased physiological activity or arousal during these times.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration, Z-score = 1.49), suggesting adequate sleep quantity. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also higher than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation, Z-score = 0.67), implying some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late, around midnight (00:56:14), with a relatively standard deviation in start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation, Z-score = -0.15). The participant also reports a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps, Z-score = 2.07).

Overall, the data suggests a participant with positive self-regard, good subjective well-being, and a tendency towards lower physiological arousal (low resting heart rate and mesor). Their daily routines show a preference for social interaction in exercise and significant internet usage, with relatively limited engagement in other sedentary activities. While sleep duration is adequate, there is variability in its length and a tendency towards later sleep onset, with a notable increase in napping behavior. The heart rate patterns indicate clear distinctions between rest and activity periods throughout the day, with elevated activity in the late afternoon and evening.

The participant's CES-D score distribution is influenced by several factors. On the positive side, indicators such as high self-esteem (SelfEsteem, Score Correlation = -0.71), moderate happiness (Happy, Score Correlation = -0.46), low anxiety (STAI, Score Correlation = 0.81), and high health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction, Score Correlation = -0.39) are all negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, suggesting a lower CES-D score. Lower perceived stress (Stress, Score Correlation = 0.28) is also generally associated with lower depressive symptoms, though the correlation here is positive, implying higher stress could be linked to higher CES-D, which is not the case here. Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI, Score Correlation = not provided but classification is good) is also generally associated with lower CES-D scores.

Conversely, several wearable metrics show positive correlations with depressive symptoms, indicating potential contributions to a higher CES-D score. A higher Mesor (Mesor, Score Correlation = 0.19), and consequently higher Resting Heart Rate (Resting Heart Rate, Score Correlation = 0.19), are weakly positively correlated with CES-D. Higher Intradaily Variability (Intradaily Variability, Score Correlation = -0.05) is weakly negatively correlated, suggesting lower variability might be associated with higher CES-D, but the correlation is very small. Higher Sleep Duration Standard Deviation (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation, Score Correlation = 0.2) and Mean Daily Naps (Mean Daily Naps, Score Correlation = 0.22) are positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting that greater variability in sleep and increased napping may be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. However, the positive correlation of Internet Usage (Internet Usage, Score Correlation = 0.26) with CES-D suggests that higher internet usage could be associated with higher depressive symptoms, which is a point of concern.

Considering the overall pattern, the strong positive indicators from self-report measures, particularly high self-esteem and low anxiety, weigh heavily towards a lower CES-D score. While there are some wearable metrics that show a weak positive correlation with CES-D (e.g., Mesor, Resting Heart Rate, Sleep Duration Standard Deviation, Mean Daily Naps, Internet Usage), their correlations are not overwhelmingly strong. The significant negative correlations from self-report measures (SelfEsteem, Happy, Health Satisfaction) are more indicative of a lower burden of depressive symptoms. The PSQI classification of ""Good Sleep"" also supports a lower CES-D score. Given the robust self-report evidence for positive psychological well-being, the participant is likely to fall in the bottom half of the CES-D distribution.

28247,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant detailed examination in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures reveal a high level of trait anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of 1.95 on the STAI, strongly correlating with CES-D scores (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is notably low, with a Z-score of -1.01 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, exhibiting a negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores, suggesting lower self-worth is associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Subjective reports of happiness are slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), but this is accompanied by a moderately elevated perception of stress (Z-score 0.38), with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Interpersonal trust is below average (Z-score -1.1), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41), suggesting that lower trust is associated with higher CES-D scores. Health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score -1.03), with a negative correlation (-0.39).

Analysis of lifestyle habits indicates limited engagement in physical activity, with low frequencies reported for exercising alone (Z-score -1.18), exercising with others (Z-score -1.58), and participating in sports (Z-score -1.09). Substance usage patterns are largely below the population average, with the exception of wine or liquor consumption, which is near the average (Z-score 0.19). Notably, this participant reports substantial engagement in listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53), both exceeding 4 hours daily, though the correlation with CES-D scores for these activities are near zero. In contrast, engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading are at or below the population average.

Wearable-derived data highlight significant irregularities in sleep patterns and circadian rhythm. The median sleep duration is notably short (6 hours 26 minutes, Z-score -0.94), and the standard deviation of sleep duration is above average (119 minutes, Z-score 0.4), suggesting inconsistency in sleep quantity. The median sleep start time is very late (01:03:49), with an exceptionally high standard deviation (208 minutes, Z-score 2.74), indicating considerable variability in sleep onset. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.48), suggesting poor day-to-day regularity in physiological patterns, and a high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51), indicating more frequent fluctuations within a 24-hour period. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly below average (Z-score -1.61), suggesting a diminished daily fluctuation in cardiovascular activity. The acrophase, representing the peak of heart rate, is reported at 4:08 PM, which is within a typical range. Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows deviations from the mesor, with notable periods of lower than average heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 4-6 AM, Z-scores 0.61 and 0.62), potentially reflecting periods of inactivity or altered physiological state during these times. Conversely, higher than average heart rates are observed during morning hours (8-11 AM, Z-scores 1.22, 0.87, 0.50).

Considering the high levels of trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and increased perceived stress, alongside significant sleep disturbances and disrupted circadian rhythm regularity, the evidence suggests a profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The strong positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D, and the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, are particularly indicative. While the participant engages in social activities and listening to music, these do not appear to fully mitigate the impact of other factors. The subjective reports of low health satisfaction and below-average trust further contribute to this interpretation. The disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm metrics, often associated with depression, further support the assessment of a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

The Self-Esteem score of 39.0 is at the upper end of the scale (10-40), indicating high self-worth, which typically correlates with lower depressive symptoms (r = -0.71). Similarly, the participant reports a high level of happiness (Z-score = -0.53), which also shows a negative correlation with depressive symptoms (r = -0.46). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 5.0 (Z-score = -0.8), suggesting no significant sleep disturbance in the past month. Anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, are low (Z-score = -0.82), indicating a stable disposition towards lower anxiety proneness, and this trait is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (r = 0.81). Interpersonal trust is moderately high (Z-score = 0.83), with a slight negative correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.41). Perceived stress is within the normative range (Z-score = -0.17), with a modest positive correlation to CES-D scores (r = 0.28). Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant engages in moderate levels of exercise (1-2 times a week for exercising alone), has low substance use, and engages in limited sedentary recreational activities such as watching TV and video games, with higher internet usage.

Wearable-derived data provides further insight into the participant's physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below the population mean (Z-score = -0.21), with a mesor of 72.0 (Z-score = -0.27). The amplitude of heart rate variation is higher than average (Z-score = 0.56), suggesting potentially more robust physiological responses. Circadian rhythm regularity is indicated by an interdaily stability of 0.47 (Z-score = 0.5) and an intradaily variability of 0.55 (Z-score = 0.03), suggesting moderate regularity in daily physiological patterns. Notably, there are significant deviations in aggregated hourly heart rate from the mesor during the evening hours, particularly between 6-7 PM (deviation of 25.34, Z-score = 2.22), and to a lesser extent, between 3-4 PM (deviation of 15.05, Z-score = 1.11) and 9-10 PM (deviation of 12.53, Z-score = 0.78). Conversely, heart rate deviations are most negative during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, deviation of -21.07, Z-score = -1.19), suggesting a typical pattern of reduced cardiovascular activity during sleep. Sleep duration is slightly longer than the population median (7 hours 34 minutes, Z-score = 0.47), with relatively consistent sleep start times (standard deviation of 68 minutes). The presence of some daily naps (0.13, Z-score = 0.7) is also observed.

The participant's CES-D score is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** of the study population distribution. While some behavioral and physiological metrics show associations that could correlate with higher depressive symptoms, these are generally outweighed by indicators of well-being and resilience. High self-esteem and happiness, coupled with good subjective sleep quality and low anxiety, are strong protective factors typically associated with lower CES-D scores. The observed heart rate patterns, particularly the evening peaks, do not strongly contradict this interpretation, and the moderate sleep duration and stability suggest a relatively regulated daily rhythm.

39146,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a profile characterized by moderate levels of anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with a tendency towards lower self-esteem and happiness. Specifically, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 42.0, with a Z-score of 0.07, indicates a disposition towards anxiety that is very close to the study population mean. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 25.0, associated with a Z-score of 0.92, suggests a notably higher-than-average appraisal of life situations as stressful. Conversely, self-esteem, measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), is relatively low, with a Z-score of 0.68 indicating lower self-worth compared to the population average. Self-reported happiness, with a Z-score of -0.53, also leans towards the lower end of the spectrum.

Behavioral patterns reveal a significant reliance on sedentary activities. While substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs) and exercise habits (exercising alone, with others, sports) are infrequent, falling below population averages, daily recreation includes substantial engagement in video games (2.47 Z-score) and considerable time spent listening to music (1.13 Z-score) and on the internet (0.85 Z-score). Notably, activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and reading are engaged in for less than 15 minutes daily, indicating a preference for more stimulating or interactive forms of leisure. Socializing with friends shows a moderate level of engagement (0.16 Z-score). Health satisfaction, with a Z-score of 0.38, is slightly above average, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0, with a Z-score of -0.8, suggests relatively good subjective sleep quality.

Wearable data indicates a mesor (average heart rate rhythm) that is slightly elevated (0.61 Z-score) relative to the population, with a resting heart rate also on the higher side (0.86 Z-score). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (10.99) is very close to the population average (0.07 Z-score), suggesting a typical daily fluctuation in cardiovascular activity. Circadian rhythm metrics reveal a moderate level of interdaily stability (0.46, 0.42 Z-score) and intradaily variability (0.62, 0.53 Z-score), implying a reasonably regular, though not exceptionally robust, daily pattern in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs around 3:57 PM, aligning with typical diurnal patterns. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of significant cardiovascular arousal, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 14.99, 6-7 PM: 15.75). Conversely, there are notable periods of reduced cardiovascular activity during the night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: -12.81, 2-3 AM: -16.74). Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes, which is slightly below average, with a standard deviation for sleep duration indicating greater variability than the population norm. The median sleep start time is late, around 1:32 AM, and its variability is also close to the population average.

Considering the CES-D population data, the 50th percentile is 11.5 and the 75th percentile is 18.0. The observed patterns of higher perceived stress, lower self-esteem and happiness, alongside sedentary behavioral tendencies, generally correlate with elevated depressive symptoms. The strong positive correlation of perceived stress with CES-D score (0.28) and negative correlations of self-esteem (-0.71) and happiness (-0.46) with CES-D are particularly indicative. While subjective sleep quality is reported as good, the objective sleep duration is slightly below average and variable. The moderate anxiety levels also contribute to a profile that leans towards higher symptomatology. Given these factors, particularly the elevated stress and reduced self-esteem/happiness, the participant's symptom profile is more likely to fall within the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

67918,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"The participant presents with a notable absence of clinically significant distress across several self-report measures, suggesting a relatively stable psychological state during the study period. Specifically, their STAI-Trait anxiety score falls within the non-anxious classification (Z-score: -0.62), indicating lower than average trait anxiety. Similarly, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score is notably high (Z-score: 1.38), suggesting robust self-worth. Perceived stress levels are also within the average range for the population (Z-score: -0.17). Interpersonal trust and self-reported happiness are slightly below population means, with Z-scores of 0.18 and -0.53 respectively, though these do not indicate significant distress. Health satisfaction is elevated (Z-score: 1.22), and the PSQI score indicates good subjective sleep quality (Z-score: -1.72), contradicting potential underlying negative affect. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, and exercise frequency is low to moderate (1-2 times a month for exercising alone and with others, ""Not at all"" for sports). Daily recreation habits include moderate engagement with watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and listening to music, with less time dedicated to reading and sedentary hobbies.

Physiological and behavioral data from the wearable device reveal a regular circadian rhythm and generally healthy sleep patterns. The participant exhibits strong interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.49) and a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 1.65), indicative of a consistent daily routine. The Mesor (mean heart rate adjusted for rhythmicity) is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 1.0), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also elevated (Z-score: 1.59), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (3:42 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly elevated but within a normal range for a young adult (Z-score: 0.55). Analysis of mean hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates predictable patterns, with a dip during nighttime hours and peaks in the early afternoon, particularly between 1 PM and 3 PM (Z-scores of 1.95 and 2.34 respectively). Sleep duration is notably long, with a median of 8 hours and 42 minutes (Z-score: 1.88), and sleep start times are consistent (Standard Deviation: 55 minutes). Napping behavior is absent. While Intradaily Variability of heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-score: -1.24), this, in conjunction with high interdaily stability, suggests a highly regulated and less varied physiological rhythm throughout the day. The correlations between these metrics and CES-D scores are generally weak and often negative, with a few slightly positive correlations for heart rate deviations during specific night and afternoon hours, and for Mesor. However, these correlations do not appear to represent a strong predictive relationship with depressive symptomatology.

Considering the comprehensive assessment of self-reported psychological states, lifestyle behaviors, and objective physiological and sleep metrics, the participant demonstrates a profile largely characterized by low levels of anxiety and stress, high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, and a regular and robust circadian rhythm. While some social and recreational engagement is moderate, the overall picture does not suggest significant distress or impairment commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The strong positive indicators such as high self-esteem and excellent sleep quality, coupled with generally low negative affect measures and consistent physiological rhythms, strongly suggest that this participant would fall within the lower half of the CES-D score distribution.

34467,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics, with several factors potentially influencing their depressive symptomology. Self-report measures indicate a generally low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.82), high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.26, reflecting a score at the upper limit of the scale), and moderate perceived stress (Stress Z-score: 0.1), all of which would typically be associated with lower CES-D scores. Furthermore, the participant reports high overall happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64), suggesting a positive subjective well-being. Academic performance is strong, with a consistent GPA above 3.8. However, subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.59), which is a common correlate of elevated depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate social interaction, spending ""31 minutes an hour"" socializing with friends, and exercises with others ""three times a week or more."" Notably, there is a strong avoidance of sedentary leisure activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music. Substance use, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is reported as ""not at all."" Academic pursuits appear to be prioritized, with limited engagement in passive recreational activities.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.49), with a lower mesor (Mesor Z-score: -2.13), suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.9) and high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.44) in heart rate, suggesting a less regular daily pattern of cardiovascular activity. This high variability might be interpreted in conjunction with the high number of reported naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.61). Sleep duration is generally adequate (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 24 minutes), but there is considerable variability in both sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 1.12) and sleep duration itself (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.61), further suggesting a lack of consistent sleep patterns. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a pronounced dip during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-5 AM deviations are significantly negative) and a sharp increase in deviation during the morning (e.g., 7-9 AM deviations are highly positive), with peaks in the early morning and evening, indicative of a disrupted or shifted circadian pattern of cardiovascular activity. This physiological profile, particularly the disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep variability, could be a contributing factor to negative mood states. The positive correlation between Intradaily Variability and CES-D score (r = -0.05, though weak) and the negative correlation with Interdaily Stability (r = -0.01) suggest that more erratic daily physiological rhythms might be associated with slightly lower CES-D scores in this dataset, while higher consistency might be weakly associated with higher CES-D scores.

Considering the self-reported high happiness, self-esteem, and low anxiety, alongside strong academic performance and social engagement, the data leans towards a more positive psychological profile. However, the subjective report of disturbed sleep and the objective measures of disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep variability present a counterpoint. The CES-D population statistics indicate a mean of 13.32 with a 50th percentile of 11.5. Given the participant's positive psychological self-reports and lack of negative lifestyle indicators (e.g., substance use, passive leisure), the presence of disturbed sleep and physiological dysregulation suggests that their CES-D score might fall within the median range rather than the higher end, despite these specific concerns. The overall pattern of robust positive traits, balanced with some concerning sleep and circadian data, suggests a CES-D score likely not in the top half of the distribution.

59673,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The participant presents with a complex profile of self-reported traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data. Self-reported measures indicate moderate levels of perceived stress (Z-score: 0.1) and subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 0.59), falling within or slightly above the study population's average for these domains. Notably, the participant reports higher-than-average self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66) and trust (Z-score: 1.15), along with above-average happiness (Z-score: 0.55). Anxiety levels are reported as not anxious (STAI Z-score: -0.43), and health satisfaction is below average (Z-score: -1.2). Substance usage patterns indicate moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise frequency is limited, with sports participation being notably absent (Sports Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement with music and internet usage, while time spent watching TV/videos, playing video games, socializing with friends, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are all reported as below average.

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 0.09) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score: 0.17) being close to the population mean. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.1) relative to the population, while the Amplitude of the heart rate variation is average (Z-score: 0.0). The Acrophase, representing the peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (5:58 PM), which is within a typical diurnal pattern. Deviations from the mesor in hourly heart rate data show a notable pattern of elevated heart rate during specific evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score: 1.44; 5-6 PM, Z-score: 0.81; 12-1 PM, Z-score: 0.78) and late night/early morning hours (12-1 AM, Z-score: 1.72; 11-12 AM, Z-score: 1.49). Conversely, there are significant dips in heart rate relative to the mesor during the early morning hours (3-4 AM, Z-score: -0.39; 4-5 AM, Z-score: -0.24; 5-6 AM, Z-score: -0.37). Resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.11). Sleep statistics indicate a slightly longer than average median sleep duration (7 hours 37 minutes, Z-score: 0.54) but with considerable variability in duration (Standard Deviation: 144 minutes, Z-score: 0.98). The median sleep start time is later than average (01:21:00), with moderate variability in start times. The participant also engages in occasional naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.18, Z-score: 1.27).

The positive correlations between higher self-esteem, happiness, and trust, and lower CES-D scores suggest that these positive psychological traits are associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Conversely, the negative correlation between higher perceived stress and CES-D scores suggests that increased stress is linked to higher depressive symptoms. The positive correlation with PSQI suggests that poorer subjective sleep quality is also associated with increased CES-D scores. For wearable metrics, while most correlations with CES-D are weak, the positive correlation between sleep duration standard deviation and CES-D suggests that inconsistent sleep patterns may be linked to higher depressive symptoms. The elevated heart rate deviations during late evening and early morning hours, coupled with disturbed sleep patterns indicated by the PSQI, may contribute to a higher CES-D score.

Considering the available data, the participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a CES-D score in the upper range of the distribution. While self-reported happiness, self-esteem, and trust are positive, the reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 0.59), moderate alcohol consumption, and limited exercise are all factors that can be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The significant variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 0.98) and the presence of occasional naps (Z-score: 1.27), coupled with specific patterns of elevated heart rate during the evening and late night, suggest physiological and behavioral disruptions that align with higher levels of depressive symptomatology. The CES-D population mean is 13.32, with a median of 11.5 and a 75th percentile of 18.0. The presence of disturbed sleep quality, alongside behavioral patterns of reduced physical activity and moderate alcohol intake, when weighed against positive self-reported traits, leans towards a CES-D score that would place the participant in the upper half of the distribution.

74899,17.0,0.727979274611399,"The participant exhibits a number of self-reported and wearable-derived metrics that suggest potential indicators of psychological distress, particularly in relation to anxiety, stress, and sleep quality. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.06, indicating a proneness to chronic anxiety that is one standard deviation above the mean of the study population. This is further contextualized by a high score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), with a Z-score of 2.28, suggesting that the participant appraises their life situations as significantly more stressful than the average individual in the study. Conversely, self-esteem is reported at a level below the mean (Z-score of -0.87), aligning with findings that lower self-esteem can be associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety.

Sleep patterns present a mixed but concerning picture. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) yields a score of 9.0, with a Z-score of 1.05, classifying the participant's sleep as disturbed, which is one standard deviation above the population mean. This subjective report of poor sleep quality is corroborated by objective Fitbit data, which indicates a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 58 minutes, a Z-score of -1.52, placing it significantly below the population average. The median sleep start time is also remarkably late, at 02:25:30, and the standard deviation for sleep start time is relatively low (65 minutes, Z-score -0.38), suggesting a somewhat consistent but highly irregular sleep schedule. The lack of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) might suggest an absence of attempts to compensate for poor nocturnal sleep, or simply no habit of napping.

Physiological data from the wearable reveals distinct patterns in heart rate variation. The participant's Mesor is slightly elevated above the population average (Z-score 0.95), and their resting heart rate is also above average (Z-score 0.47). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is moderately elevated (Z-score 0.54), suggesting a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:49 PM, which is not inherently indicative of pathology but contributes to the overall chronobiological profile. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a more pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -15.78 to -21.29 from 3 AM to 8 AM), which aligns with typical sleep-wake cycles, but the magnitude of these deviations, particularly during pre-awakening hours (e.g., -21.29 at 7-8 AM), could reflect suppressed physiological arousal. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during the evening hours, with peaks of 22.1 (5-6 PM) and 15.49 (6-7 PM), potentially reflecting periods of increased physiological activation or stress during these times. The interdaily stability of heart rate is close to average (Z-score 0.17), suggesting a moderate level of daily regularity in heart rate patterns, while intradaily variability is slightly higher than average (Z-score 0.46), indicating more fluctuations within a given day.

The correlation data provides additional context for these metrics. The strong positive correlation between STAI anxiety scores and CES-D scores (0.81) is a significant indicator. Similarly, a strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D scores (-0.71) suggests that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D (0.28) and negative correlations with health satisfaction (-0.39) and happiness (-0.46) further support the link between these psychological constructs and depressive symptomatology. While correlations with sleep metrics and wearable data are generally weaker, the negative correlation with median sleep duration (-0.0) and the absence of a meaningful correlation with interdaily stability (-0.0) suggest that while objective sleep duration is low, its direct correlation with CES-D might be less pronounced compared to subjective psychological factors.

Considering the elevated levels of anxiety, perceived stress, and disturbed subjective sleep quality, coupled with significantly reduced objective sleep duration and strong correlations with negative psychological states, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution. The objective indicators of sleep disturbance and the self-reported psychological distress are substantial enough to suggest a considerable burden of depressive symptoms.

35011,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"The participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that warrant careful consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. Self-report data indicate a generally low level of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.52) and a high level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.96), which are generally inversely associated with depressive symptoms. However, a notable finding is the participant's significantly lower-than-average satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.78), which often correlates with poorer mental well-being. Perceived stress levels are also reported as being lower than average (Stress Z-score: -0.98), which could be a protective factor, though the correlation with CES-D score (0.29) is moderate. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI Score: 7.0, Z-score: 0.13), which is a well-established correlate of depression.

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance usage (Beer and Wine or Liquor usage: ""1-2 times a week""), which are above average for the population (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). This is contrasted by a reported absence of recreational and non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are infrequent, with participation in solitary or group exercise, and sports occurring only ""1-2 times a month."" Daily recreational habits show a tendency towards more sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Time: ""31 minutes an hour"", Z-score: 0.64) and internet usage, with lower engagement in activities like video games, reading, and socializing with friends. Notably, the correlation of several of these activities with CES-D score, such as substance usage and sedentary habits, are weak and generally non-significant, suggesting these behaviors may not be strongly indicative of depressive symptomatology in this individual.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data reveal significant patterns. Interdaily stability of activity patterns is notably low (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.98), suggesting irregular daily routines. This is accompanied by high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.37), indicating substantial fluctuations in activity throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: -1.62), further underscoring a lack of consistent daily rhythm. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average mesor (Mesor Z-score: 1.74) and resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 2.31), suggesting a generally elevated physiological arousal state. Conversely, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly lower than average (Amplitude Z-score: -2.1), indicating a reduced range of physiological fluctuation across the day. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of ""6 hours 5 minutes,"" which is below average (Duration Z-score: -1.37), and a median sleep start time of ""02:34:00,"" indicative of significant sleep schedule irregularity. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pattern of lower heart rates during early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM) and higher heart rates during evening and late night hours, particularly between 7-10 PM, which deviates from typical diurnal patterns and may reflect disruptions in the sleep-wake cycle. The low interdaily stability, low amplitude, and irregular sleep patterns are strongly associated with disrupted circadian rhythms, which are frequently observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.

Considering the evidence, the participant's depressed sleep duration, disturbed subjective sleep quality, low interdaily stability, low amplitude of heart rate variability, and irregular sleep start times are significant indicators that align with higher levels of depressive symptomatology. While self-reported high self-esteem and low anxiety are protective factors, these are overshadowed by the physiological and behavioral indicators of dysregulation. The overall pattern suggests a notable burden of depressive symptoms.

Self-report measures indicate a high level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.35) and disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 1.52), with scores significantly above the population average. Concurrently, the participant reports low self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: -1.85) and low levels of happiness (Happy Z-score: -1.61), with scores substantially below the population mean. Interpersonal trust is also reported to be low (Trust Z-score: -1.74), aligning with the pattern of lower self-reported well-being. Perceived stress is near the population average (Stress Z-score: -0.17), and health satisfaction is reported as low (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.7).

Behavioral data reveal a mixed pattern. While substance usage is generally low, with no reported use of beer or recreational drugs, the participant reports moderate use of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week). Exercise frequency is low, with participation in solo or group exercise occurring only 1-2 times a month, and sports engagement also infrequent. In terms of daily recreational habits, there is a notable prevalence of sedentary activities. The participant spends a considerable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour), playing video games (31 minutes an hour), and engaging with the internet (more than 4 hours), and listening to music (more than 4 hours). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, which is near the population average, but reading is limited to 16-30 minutes.

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate a less regular daily structure. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is notably low (Z-score: -1.56), suggesting poor consistency in daily activity patterns. While Intradaily Variability is close to the population average, the low interdaily stability may reflect difficulties in maintaining a consistent daily routine. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.45), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also reduced (Z-score: -1.04), indicating less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon. Resting heart rate is within the population average range (Z-score: 0.01).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of marked cardiovascular arousal and suppression relative to the participant's average. The most pronounced positive deviations, indicative of higher physiological arousal, occur in the early evening hours, specifically between 5-6 PM (Z-score: 1.43) and 8-9 PM (Z-score: 0.91). Conversely, the most significant negative deviations, suggesting reduced cardiovascular activity, are observed during the early morning hours between 3-4 AM (Z-score: 0.77) and 4-5 AM (Z-score: 1.0), and also between 2-3 AM (Z-score: 0.64). These patterns suggest a substantial disconnect between typical daily activity and physiological response, with heightened arousal in the evening and significant suppression during the night.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 44 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.56). The standard deviation of sleep duration is close to average, suggesting some consistency in the length of sleep obtained, though the overall duration is insufficient. The median sleep start time is early morning (01:25:49), with a notable standard deviation in sleep start times, indicating irregular sleep timing. The mean daily naps are slightly above average, which may be compensatory for insufficient nighttime sleep.

Given the constellation of self-reported psychological distress, particularly elevated anxiety, low self-esteem and happiness, and disturbed sleep quality, alongside a relatively sedentary lifestyle and irregular sleep patterns, the evidence suggests a profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The strong negative correlations between low self-esteem, low happiness, low trust, and low health satisfaction with CES-D scores, along with the positive correlation with anxiety, are particularly pertinent. While some behavioral metrics, like internet and music listening time, are elevated, these may represent coping mechanisms for underlying distress rather than indicators of positive well-being. The disorganization in circadian rhythms, particularly low interdaily stability, and suboptimal sleep duration further contribute to this interpretation. The overall pattern leans towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

A notably high Z-score of 3.83 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) strongly suggests significant subjective sleep disturbances, which is a common correlate of depression. Complementing this, the participant reports extremely low happiness levels, evidenced by a Z-score of -1.61. Conversely, perceived stress is elevated, indicated by a Z-score of 2.83 on the Perceived Stress Scale. Trait anxiety is also reported at a higher than average level, with a STAI score Z-score of 0.56. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.31), and health satisfaction is somewhat elevated (Z-score of 0.72). Interpersonal trust is reported at a below-average level (Z-score of -0.78). In terms of daily activities, the participant engages in extensive listening to music (Z-score of 2.06) and moderate amounts of socializing with friends (Z-score of 0.95) and reading (Z-score of 1.3). Exercise habits are relatively active, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), although sports participation is notably absent (Z-score of -1.09). Substance usage is minimal across all reported categories.

From the wearable data, several physiological and circadian rhythm metrics provide further insight. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the population (Z-score of 0.65). The Mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is also slightly above average (Z-score of 0.53). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is near the population average (Z-score of 0.05). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, during the late afternoon and early evening (5-7 PM), heart rate deviations are significantly elevated, reaching Z-scores of 0.84 and 0.80, respectively. Conversely, late-night and early-morning hours (12 AM - 6 AM) exhibit pronounced negative deviations from the Mesor, indicating periods of substantially lower than average heart rate during typical sleep times, with the 12-1 AM hour showing a particularly low Z-score of -1.73. Circadian rhythm regularity metrics indicate a slightly lower than average interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.16) and a higher than average intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.81), suggesting less consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Sleep statistics reveal a longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score of 1.22), but a standard deviation in sleep duration that is close to average. The median sleep start time is late (00:31:32), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is also close to the population average, suggesting some variability in sleep timing.

Considering the evidence, the participant exhibits significant indicators suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. The extremely poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI), very low self-reported happiness, high perceived stress, and elevated trait anxiety are strong correlates of depression. While self-esteem is only slightly below average, and interpersonal trust is moderately low, these factors further contribute to a psychological profile potentially associated with depressive symptoms. The physiological data, particularly the marked deviations in heart rate during the night, suggests a disrupted circadian rhythm and potentially less restorative sleep, aligning with the self-reported sleep disturbances. The higher intradaily variability in heart rate may also reflect a less stable physiological state. Despite some positive lifestyle elements such as moderate social engagement and reading, the constellation of negative psychological self-reports, coupled with objective physiological indicators of disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm, suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms. These factors collectively position the participant in the upper half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

Conversely, perceived stress is notably lower than the population average (Stress Z-score of -0.71), and self-reported happiness is also below average (Happy Z-score of -0.53). Subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification with a Z-score of -0.33, suggesting a mild to moderate concern in this domain. Interpersonal trust is slightly above the population mean (Trust Z-score of 0.18), and health satisfaction is slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -0.37).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumption occurring 1-2 times per week, and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are mixed; while sports participation is relatively frequent (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91), exercising alone is infrequent (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.43) and exercising with others is notably absent (Z-score -1.58). Daily recreational habits show a pattern of limited engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.62) and sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.36). Internet usage is higher than average (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), while video games, listening to music, and socializing with friends fall within or slightly above average ranges. Notably, reading is reported as not occurring.

Wearable data reveals a circadian rhythm with moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.17) and variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.25). The Mesor, representing the mean 24-hour heart rate, is below the population average (Mesor Z-score of -0.41), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is slightly above average (Amplitude Z-score of 0.24). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:00 PM). The resting heart rate is significantly below the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of -0.70), suggesting a physiologically calm baseline. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a distinct pattern: significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -12.22 to -23.31), followed by a marked increase in heart rate during the mid-morning (8-9 AM, Z-score 2.26) and evening hours (7-9 PM, Z-score 1.10 to 1.82). This pattern suggests a potentially disrupted circadian rhythm with pronounced dips during sleep and elevated periods during waking hours, particularly in the morning and evening. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-score 1.18) and a stable sleep start time (Median Sleep Start Time around midnight), though the standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly elevated. The participant also exhibits a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score of 1.27).

Considering the available data, there is evidence suggesting a potentially elevated CES-D score. While self-reported anxiety and self-esteem are favorable, the below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and the presence of disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score -0.33) are indicators that can correlate with depressive symptoms. The significant deviations in hourly heart rate, particularly the pronounced dips during early morning hours and elevated periods during the day, alongside an increased frequency of naps, could reflect disruptions in circadian regulation that are often associated with depression. The low engagement in social activities with others and absence of reading as a hobby, while not definitive, could also contribute to a profile of reduced social engagement and anhedonia, which are core components of depression. Although some metrics like resting heart rate are favorable, the constellation of disrupted sleep patterns, potentially atypical physiological arousal patterns, and lower self-reported happiness leans towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

17308,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant detailed consideration. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.17), correlating positively with depressive symptoms (r = 0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is slightly lower than average (Z-score = -0.17), with a notable negative correlation with CES-D scores (r = -0.71), suggesting lower self-worth may be associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress levels are higher than the population average (Z-score = 0.92), with a moderate positive correlation with depressive symptoms (r = 0.28), indicating that higher perceived stress is linked to more pronounced depressive symptoms. While general happiness is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.55), its correlation with depressive symptoms is negative (r = -0.46), implying that higher reported happiness is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Z-score = 0.8), with a moderate negative correlation with depressive symptoms (r = -0.39). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is reported as good (Z-score = -0.8), contradicting some objective metrics. Interpersonal trust is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.14), with a weak negative correlation with depressive symptoms (r = -0.41).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate levels of substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported as 1-2 times a week, falling above the population average in frequency (Z-scores for Beer and Wine or Liquor are 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), though with weak negative correlations to depressive symptoms. Exercise habits indicate frequent solitary exercise (Z-score = 1.07), with moderate frequency of exercising with others and engaging in sports, all showing weak negative correlations with depressive symptoms. Daily recreational activities reveal notably low engagement in passive screen time, video games, and internet usage, with particularly low Z-scores for internet usage (Z-score = -1.83), suggesting minimal time spent on these activities. Conversely, time spent listening to music and socializing with friends is within the lower average range (Z-scores of -0.26 and -1.41 respectively). Reading and other sedentary hobbies are reported as not being engaged in. These patterns suggest a tendency towards more active or less passive leisure pursuits.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics reveal some deviations from normative patterns. Interdaily stability of activity is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.33), while intradaily variability is close to average (Z-score = -0.04). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also below average (Z-score = -0.53), suggesting a less robust daily rhythmicity. The mesor of heart rate is significantly lower than average (Z-score = -1.79), and resting heart rate is also considerably lower than average (Z-score = -1.3), implying a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. Heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of lower than expected cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM showing Z-scores ranging from -0.43 to -1.46), and higher than expected activity in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 3-6 PM showing Z-scores of 1.05 to 1.21). Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 27 minutes, which is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.33). However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score = -0.84), suggesting more consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late (01:18:29), with a standard deviation of 36 minutes, indicating moderate consistency in sleep timing. Napping behavior is absent (Z-score = -0.86).

Considering the totality of the data, the participant presents a complex profile. Elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with lower self-esteem, are significant indicators associated with higher CES-D scores. While subjective sleep quality is reported as good, the late sleep start time and deviations in heart rate variability could suggest underlying issues with sleep regulation or circadian misalignment, which are often linked to depressive symptoms. The positive correlations between anxiety, perceived stress, and CES-D scores, and the negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D scores, are particularly salient. Despite some healthier behavioral choices like frequent exercise, the psychological factors of anxiety and stress, along with diminished self-esteem, are strong predictors of elevated depressive symptomatology. The slightly elevated substance use (beer, wine/liquor) and notably low engagement in some sedentary digital activities do not strongly sway the interpretation towards either extreme. The overall pattern of psychological distress indicators, despite some positive behavioral and subjective sleep indicators, suggests a leaning towards higher depressive symptom burden.

Their self-esteem is notably high (Z-score = 1.1), indicating a strong sense of self-worth, which correlates negatively with CES-D scores (-0.71). Conversely, their perceived stress levels are moderate (Z-score = -0.44), with a slight positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.28). Interpersonal trust is relatively low (Z-score = -1.42), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.41). Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.46). Anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI, is within the non-anxious range (Z-score = -0.62), but it shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is indicated as disturbed (Z-score = 0.59), with a moderate positive correlation to CES-D scores, although the specific correlation value is not provided. Health satisfaction is high (Z-score = 1.63), with a negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.39).

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor usage of ""1-2 times a week"", with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), showing minimal correlation with CES-D scores. They report no recreational or non-prescribed drug use (Z-scores of -0.31 and -0.11). Notably, they consistently engage in physical activity, exercising alone and with others, and participating in sports ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively), all with negative correlations to CES-D scores. Their daily recreational habits indicate relatively low engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = -0.62) and video games (Z-score = -0.56), and moderate internet usage (Z-score = -0.49). They spend a substantial amount of time listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13), with a positive correlation to CES-D scores. Socializing with friends is at an average level (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.16), with negligible correlation. They do not engage in reading or other sedentary hobbies (Z-scores of -0.67 and -0.36 respectively).

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits significant deviations in their heart rate pattern. Their resting heart rate is notably low (Z-score = -2.03), and their mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows a generally lower than average heart rate during nocturnal and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, Z-scores ranging from -0.21 to -1.17). Conversely, there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 4-6 PM, 6-7 PM, 8-9 PM, 10-11 PM, with Z-scores ranging from 0.36 to 1.57), suggesting a potential dysregulation in diurnal cardiovascular activity. The overall mesor is also low (Z-score = -1.9). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate low interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.74), suggesting a less regular daily pattern, and high intradaily variability (Z-score = 1.23), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate within a day. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours (Z-score = -0.28), which is slightly below average, and a relatively consistent sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score = -0.34). The median sleep start time is late (00:56 AM), with a moderate variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 0.61).

The analysis of the participant's data suggests a complex interplay of factors. While high self-esteem and engagement in regular exercise are positive indicators, the disturbed sleep quality, lower than average happiness, and a pronounced deviation in heart rate patterns, particularly the high intradaily variability and late sleep onset, are noteworthy. The positive correlation between STAI (anxiety) and CES-D scores, despite the participant being classified as ""not anxious,"" warrants attention. The combination of disturbed sleep, lower happiness, and significant physiological variability, alongside a strong positive correlation between anxiety and depressive symptoms, suggests a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology, which could place them in the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

77872,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics. Self-reported measures indicate a low propensity for anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.82) and a relatively high level of self-esteem (Z-score: 0.82). Interpersonal trust is also reported as moderately high (Z-score: 0.83). Happiness levels are reported slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53), and perceived stress is near the population mean (Z-score: -0.17). Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score: 0.97). Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (beer 1-2 times a week, wine/liquor 1-2 times a month) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise frequency is reported as 1-2 times a week for both solo and group activities, with no participation in sports. Daily recreational activities are generally low in duration, with the exception of reading (16-30 minutes) and internet/music/socializing (31 minutes to an hour).

Wearable data provides further insights into behavioral and physiological patterns. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable interdaily rhythm (Z-score: -0.08) but with lower than average intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.31), suggesting a more regular daily pattern of physiological activity. The Mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours) is above average (Z-score: 0.65), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also elevated (Z-score: 0.75), indicating a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:58 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.04). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a distinct pattern: the deepest deviations below the mesor occur during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM: Z-score -0.23, 5-6 AM: Z-score -0.42, 6-7 AM: Z-score -0.44). Conversely, elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor are observed in the late evening and midday, particularly between 5-6 PM (Z-score 1.39) and late night (11 PM-12 AM: Z-score 1.85).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 50 minutes, which is below average (Z-score: -0.44), with a more consistent sleep duration standard deviation than the population (Z-score: -0.84). The median sleep start time is late, around 1:58 AM, with a typical standard deviation for sleep start time (Z-score: -0.02). There are no reported daily naps. The PSQI score suggests good sleep quality, below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance (Z-score: -0.8).

Overall, this participant presents with relatively low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and good health satisfaction. Their daily routine appears moderately structured, with some evidence of later sleep onset and potentially insufficient sleep duration, though sleep quality is reported as good. The elevated mesor and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm, coupled with specific patterns of deviation, suggest an active physiological state, particularly during certain periods of the day and night. The negative correlation between self-reported happiness and CES-D scores, combined with slightly below-average happiness, warrants attention. While other factors like stress and sleep quality do not strongly correlate with CES-D in this data, the pattern of lower happiness and certain behavioral characteristics like reduced physical activity and sleep duration are suggestive. The provided CES-D population data indicates a mean of 13.31 and a 50th percentile of 11.5. Without the participant's specific CES-D score, it is challenging to definitively place them. However, considering the self-reported happiness score and other less direct indicators, the evidence suggests a potential for moderate depressive symptomatology.

72348,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The participant presents with a complex pattern of self-reported traits, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics. Psychometrically, the individual reports relatively low anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.23) and moderate self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of -0.59), suggesting a generally stable disposition. However, a notable indicator of potential distress is the PSQI score of 8.0, which falls above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance (Z-score of 0.59). This subjective report of poor sleep quality is congruent with sleep statistics from wearable data, which indicate a significantly longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 22 minutes, Z-score of 1.48) and a more stable sleep start time (standard deviation of 26 minutes, Z-score of -1.24) compared to the study population. These findings suggest a tendency towards oversleeping or fragmented sleep, rather than insufficient sleep, which can be indicative of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports relatively low self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score of -0.53) and a moderate level of perceived stress (Stress Z-score of 0.1).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pattern of high engagement in sedentary activities, with considerable time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.28), internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score of 1.52), and other sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.41). In contrast, physical activity is notably low, with infrequent exercise frequency (Exercised Alone: 1-2 times a month, Z-score of -0.43; Exercised with Others: Less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score of -0.88) and no engagement in sports. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, aligning with very low Z-scores. The participant's social engagement with friends is reported as 1-2 hours, which is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.16).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveal a highly regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by the exceptionally high Interdaily Stability (Value 0.65, Z-score 1.99) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value 0.62, Z-score 2.49). This indicates a consistent daily patterning of activity and physiological signals. The Mesor (heart rate mean) is elevated (Value 86.31, Z-score 1.69), and the Resting Heart Rate is also significantly higher than average (Value 71.2, Z-score 1.55), suggesting a generally higher physiological arousal. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a pronounced dip in heart rate deviation from the mesor during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-7 am), with deviations ranging from -13.85 to -17.63. Heart rate then increases significantly in the morning and mid-day, peaking in the 9-10 am hour (deviation 16.63). This pattern, coupled with the high Interdaily Stability and Mesor, suggests a rigid physiological cycle, potentially with a blunted response to typical daily fluctuations.

The correlations provided offer further insight. A positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D scores (0.28) aligns with the moderate perceived stress level. Conversely, the negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D scores (-0.71) and happiness and CES-D scores (-0.46) strongly suggests that lower self-esteem and happiness are associated with higher depressive symptoms. The positive correlation between disturbed sleep (PSQI) and CES-D scores (implied by the lack of a negative correlation, and general association of poor sleep with depression) is also a key indicator. While some physiological metrics like Resting Heart Rate have a positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.2), the overall picture suggests that lower self-reported well-being (happiness, self-esteem) and disturbed sleep are the most significant predictors of depressive symptomatology in this dataset. The high Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation in heart rate, along with a longer sleep duration, could be interpreted as indicators of a withdrawal or lack of engagement typical in depressive states, despite an otherwise regular physiological cycle.

Considering the participant's elevated PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, lower self-reported happiness, and negative correlations with self-esteem and happiness, there is substantial evidence suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The population's 50th percentile for CES-D is 11.5. The participant's subjective reports of low happiness, low self-esteem, and poor sleep quality, all of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores, point towards a CES-D score that would likely fall above the median.

Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is significantly elevated (Z-score = 0.76), correlating positively with CES-D score (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score = 0.26), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.71). Perceived stress is notably low (Z-score = -0.44), while happiness is above average (Z-score = 0.55), both showing correlations with CES-D that are in the expected directions, though relatively weak (r = 0.28 and r = -0.46 respectively). Sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Z-score = 0.13), with a slight tendency to correlate with CES-D (correlation not explicitly provided, but PSQI Z-score suggests moderate disturbance). Notably, the participant engages in high levels of physical activity, with frequent exercise alone, with others, and participation in sports, all exceeding population norms (Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively), which generally show weak negative correlations with CES-D. However, sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games are also prevalent, with the latter showing a particularly high Z-score (1.71).

From the wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.24), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. The MESOR (mean heart rate) is elevated (Z-score = 0.87), and resting heart rate is also significantly higher than the population average (Z-score = 1.24). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of reduced cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, Z-scores of 1.05 and 0.80 respectively), followed by pronounced elevations in heart rate during midday and early afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM, Z-score = 1.05; 1-2 PM, Z-score = 1.49). This pattern may indicate a delayed sleep phase or altered diurnal rhythm. Sleep duration is notably longer than average (Z-score = 1.26), but sleep start times are significantly delayed and highly variable (Median Sleep Start Time: 02:02:30; Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.9), aligning with the observed heart rate patterns and potentially contributing to subjective sleep disturbance. The high prevalence of naps (Z-score = 1.27) further supports atypical sleep patterns.

Overall, while the participant reports higher-than-average happiness and low perceived stress, the elevated anxiety, disturbed sleep quality, highly irregular and delayed sleep schedule, and a diurnal heart rate pattern characterized by reduced activity during typical wakeful periods and heightened activity during midday suggest a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. The significant elevation in anxiety and the indicators of disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm are particularly concerning in the context of CES-D assessment.

The participant's data suggests a CES-D score that would likely fall within the top 50% of the study population distribution. While some indicators such as perceived stress and happiness are in a direction suggesting lower depressive symptomatology, the presence of significantly elevated anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, objective sleep schedule irregularities, and marked deviations in diurnal heart rate patterns point towards a considerable symptom load. The positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D score (0.81), and the negative correlation with self-esteem (-0.71), further support this interpretation.

Happiness is also reported at a level slightly above the population average (Happy Z-score: 0.55). Conversely, health satisfaction is notably lower than the population average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2), suggesting some dissatisfaction with physical well-being. Perceived stress levels are below average (Stress Z-score: -0.71), and interpersonal trust is above average (Trust Z-score: 0.83).

Behaviorally, the participant reports consistent substance usage of beer and wine/liquor (1-2 times a week for both), with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively, indicating higher than average consumption. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency is notably low, with ""Not at all"" reported for exercising alone, with others, and for sports, reflected in significant negative Z-scores for these activities (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.01) and socializing with friends (Z-score: 0.16), while time spent on internet usage, listening to music, and sedentary hobbies are around the population average. Reading and video games are not engaged in.

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a generally regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.74) and intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.16) are below average, suggesting some deviation from a highly consistent daily pattern, further supported by a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.29). The mesor (average heart rate around the circadian rhythm) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.39), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also lower than average (Z-score: -0.81), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (4:37 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal generally lower heart rates during the night and early morning hours, particularly between 3-6 AM, which is expected. Deviations in the late morning and afternoon tend to be positive, indicating periods of higher activity or arousal relative to the mesor. The resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.11).

Sleep statistics indicate a significantly longer than average median sleep duration (9 hours 22 minutes, Z-score: 2.71). However, the standard deviation for sleep duration (169 minutes, Z-score: 1.55) and sleep start time (137 minutes, Z-score: 1.19) suggest considerable variability in sleep patterns, implying a less consistent sleep schedule. The median sleep start time is just past midnight (00:10:24). Notably, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is very high (Score: 14.0, Z-score: 3.37), indicating significantly disturbed sleep, which is a strong indicator of potential mood-related issues.

Considering the data holistically, while self-reported psychological traits like happiness and self-esteem are not overtly low, several factors point towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The significantly disturbed sleep quality (high PSQI score), coupled with high variability in sleep duration and start times, is a strong marker. The low frequency of exercise and less engaging daily habits, alongside increased substance usage, are also behaviors often associated with depressive states. While perceived stress is low, this could be influenced by a desire to downplay stress or a resignation to stressful circumstances. The correlations provided, though not the sole basis for interpretation, show some negative correlations between CES-D scores and positive psychological indicators (SelfEsteem, Happy, Health Satisfaction, Trust), and a positive correlation with perceived stress. The high PSQI score and sleep variability are particularly salient indicators that suggest the participant experiences a significant burden of depressive symptoms.

28254,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported traits and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological data, with several indicators suggesting potential areas of concern relevant to depressive symptomatology. Self-reported data reveals a moderate level of happiness (Z-score: -0.53), below the study population average, alongside a tendency towards higher perceived stress (Z-score: -0.71), although this latter finding indicates a stress level below the population mean, suggesting a relatively lower appraisal of stress. Importantly, self-esteem is notably high (Score: 40.0, Z-Score: 0.26, correlation: -0.71 with CES-D), which typically acts as a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Similarly, anxiety levels are within the non-anxious range (STAI Z-score: -0.92). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is indicated as disturbed (Score: 7.0, Z-Score: 0.13), with a score above 5 often signaling clinical significance, and this measure shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Physical health satisfaction is moderate (Z-score: 0.55).

Behavioral patterns indicate moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor usage reported as 1-2 times per week, aligning with higher Z-scores and thus above the population average for these specific substances, though correlations with CES-D are negligible. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency is relatively low, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a week and with others or sports occurring 1-2 times a month, and these exhibit negative correlations with CES-D. Daily recreational activities show a mixed pattern: moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, while internet usage and socializing with friends are reported as more time-consuming (31 minutes an hour), with socializing having a weak negative correlation to CES-D. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for shorter durations.

Wearable data provides objective measures of physiological and circadian rhythm regularity. The participant demonstrates low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.07) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.6), suggesting a less regular daily behavioral pattern. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is relatively low (Z-score: -0.78), indicating a smaller diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. Sleep duration is on average 6 hours and 45 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.53) and has a negative correlation with CES-D. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also notably low (Z-score: -1.26), suggesting a consistent, albeit potentially insufficient, sleep duration. Sleep start times are highly variable, with a standard deviation of 122 minutes (Z-score: 0.86), indicating a more erratic sleep schedule. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals significant deviations during specific periods. Notably, there are pronounced negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am: -11.75, 1-2 am: -13.47, 10-11 pm: -7.67, 11-12 am: -7.42), with Z-scores indicating these are significantly lower than expected compared to the population. Conversely, the late morning and early afternoon hours show positive deviations (e.g., 7-8 am: 4.36, 8-9 am: 9.46, 1-2 pm: 12.98, 2-3 pm: 12.42), suggesting periods of higher physiological arousal relative to the individual's baseline during these times. These patterns, particularly the late-night/early-morning dips in heart rate, alongside objectively shorter sleep duration and high sleep start time variability, are noteworthy.

Considering the provided data, the participant's CES-D score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population. While subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and shorter sleep duration are present, and some behavioral patterns like limited exercise and higher internet/socializing time could be associated with lower mood, these are counterbalanced by significant protective factors. The participant reports high self-esteem and low anxiety, which are strong indicators against elevated depressive symptoms. The correlations provided, while not definitive, generally show weak associations between many of the measured variables and CES-D. The most salient indicators for a lower CES-D score are the high self-esteem score and low anxiety score, which are typically robust predictors of well-being. While sleep disturbances and lower sleep duration are present, they do not appear to be driving a significantly high CES-D score in the context of these other psychological strengths.

Interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.33) and intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.03) are within typical ranges, suggesting some level of routine. However, the Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.43), and the Amplitude is also above average (Z-score: 0.63), indicating greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is observed in the evening at 6:18 PM. Notably, the resting heart rate is average (Z-score: -0.04). Analysis of mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals significant deviations during the late night and early morning hours, with higher positive deviations between 12-1 AM and 1-2 AM, and pronounced negative deviations from 3-6 AM, suggesting a disruption in the expected diurnal heart rate pattern, possibly linked to sleep disturbances. The most pronounced positive deviation from the Mesor occurs between 6-7 PM (Z-score: 1.75), aligning with the acrophase.

Sleep statistics from the wearable device indicate a considerably longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 29 minutes, Z-score: 1.61), with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (146 minutes, Z-score: 1.04). This suggests inconsistent sleep timing and potentially fragmented sleep. The median sleep start time is late at 2:12 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (56 minutes, Z-score: -0.6). The average number of daily naps is high (0.3, Z-score: 2.66), further indicating potential issues with sleep regulation. While a longer sleep duration might seem beneficial, the high variability in duration and start time, coupled with the late start time and frequent naps, points towards significant sleep dysregulation, which is a common correlate of depressive symptoms.

Considering the constellation of findings, particularly the low self-esteem, subjective sleep disturbance, low interpersonal trust, and significant sleep dysregulation indicated by wearable data (late start times, high variability, and frequent naps), these factors are often associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. While trait anxiety is low, other indicators suggest a burden of depressive symptoms. The negative correlations between self-esteem, trust, and happiness with CES-D, along with the positive correlations of sleep duration variability and napping with CES-D, weigh towards a higher symptom load.

45641,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"This participant presents with several self-reported psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. A notable finding is the elevated STAI-Trait score (46.0, Z=0.46), indicating a tendency towards chronic anxiety, which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is relatively low (RSES=32.0, Z=-0.87), with a negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.71), suggesting that lower self-worth is associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Health satisfaction is also reported as low (2.33, Z=-1.45), with a negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.39), implying that dissatisfaction with physical health may be linked to increased depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (23.0, Z=0.38) and positively correlated with CES-D (r=0.28). Reported happiness is below average (3.0, Z=-0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46), indicating that lower happiness is associated with more depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is slightly above average (3.33, Z=0.18) but shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.41), suggesting that even a slight decrease in trust could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Sleep quality, as measured by PSQI, is reported as disturbed (7.0, Z=0.13), with a positive correlation to CES-D (r=0.13), consistent with the common association between poor sleep and depression.

The participant's behavioral habits reveal certain patterns. Substance usage for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs are all at or below normative levels. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, as well as participation in sports, are all infrequent. Daily recreational activities are dominated by sedentary behaviors, including significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes/hour, Z=0.64), video games (16-30 minutes, Z=0.96), internet usage (2-3 hours, Z=0.85), listening to music (1-2 hours, Z=0.67), and sedentary hobbies (2-3 hours, Z=2.01). Notably, social interaction with friends is very limited (16-30 minutes, Z=-1.41). These patterns of low physical activity and high engagement in passive entertainment may be indicative of a withdrawn lifestyle, which can be associated with depressive symptoms, though the correlations with CES-D for most of these specific activities are weak.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicates some deviations from normative patterns. The interdaily stability of activity is notably high (0.58, Z=1.41), suggesting a relatively consistent daily routine in terms of activity levels, with a slight negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.01). Conversely, intradaily variability is below average (0.47, Z=-0.53), indicating less fluctuation in activity within a day, which correlates negatively with CES-D (r=-0.05). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (0.42, Z=0.81), suggesting some degree of temporal regularity in activity patterns, with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (r=0.02). The Mesor of heart rate is elevated (80.02, Z=0.83), and the amplitude is also higher than average (13.3, Z=0.81), with positive and negative correlations to CES-D respectively (r=0.19 and r=-0.1). The acrophase of heart rate occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (5:58 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly elevated (63.2, Z=0.6) with a positive correlation to CES-D (r=0.19). Analysis of mean aggregate deviation from mesor shows elevated heart rate in the late morning (9-10 AM, Z=-1.08), mid-afternoon (1-2 PM, Z=0.74), and particularly in the late evening (9-10 PM, Z=1.83; 10-11 PM, Z=1.13). The late evening elevation in heart rate is particularly noteworthy given its strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=-0.05 for 9-10 PM, r=0.0 for 10-11 PM, though these are weak, the overall pattern of elevated evening heart rate alongside potential sleep issues warrants attention). Sleep statistics indicate a generally adequate median sleep duration (7 hours 54 minutes, Z=0.89) with low variability (100 minutes, Z=-0.02). However, the median sleep start time is quite late (01:59:30) with moderate variability (50 minutes, Z=-0.73). The lack of daily naps (0.0, Z=-0.86) is normative.

Considering the combined self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, several factors suggest a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, low health satisfaction, moderately high perceived stress, and low self-reported happiness. These psychological indicators are consistently correlated with increased CES-D scores. While sleep duration is adequate, subjective sleep quality is disturbed, and the late sleep onset time might contribute to a disrupted circadian rhythm. Behavioral patterns are characterized by low physical activity and high engagement in passive, sedentary leisure activities, with limited social interaction, which can be a marker of withdrawal associated with depression. Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate and notable elevations in heart rate during the late evening hours, alongside a more pronounced daytime activity pattern with earlier morning lows, could reflect physiological dysregulation that often accompanies depressive states. The positive correlations between several of these metrics and CES-D, even if some are modest, collectively point towards a profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology.

64572,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile characterized by several distinct features related to their psychological state, behavioral habits, and physiological functioning. Self-report data reveal lower-than-average anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -0.62) and above-average self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: 0.54). However, these positive indicators are counterbalanced by a notable pattern of disturbed sleep, as indicated by the PSQI score (Z-score: -0.33) falling above the commonly cited threshold for clinically significant disturbance, despite its slightly below-average Z-score. The participant reports moderate perceived stress (Stress Z-score: 0.1) and below-average happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53), alongside below-average health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.45). Interpersonal trust levels are notably higher than the study average (Trust Z-score: 0.83).

Behavioral patterns indicate consistent engagement in physical activity, with exercise frequency of ""1-2 times a week"" for solo workouts and sports, and ""1-2 times a month"" for exercising with others. Notably, substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with significant negative Z-scores for beer and wine/liquor, suggesting minimal to absent consumption. Daily recreational habits are relatively moderate, with the exception of video gaming, where the participant spends ""16-30 minutes"" daily, which is above the average for this activity.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a relatively low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.93) and a lower-than-average Mesor (Mesor Z-score: -0.92), suggesting a generally lower level of autonomic arousal at rest. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals high interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 1.66), indicating a highly regular daily pattern in heart rate, alongside average intraday variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -0.11). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:57 PM), which is within the typical range. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced blunting of heart rate during the overnight hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -20.61, 3-4 AM: -22.41, 4-5 AM: -24.54, 5-6 AM: -24.75, 6-7 AM: -24.32 deviation from mesor). This is followed by a noticeable increase in heart rate during the late evening and early night, particularly between 7-8 PM (21.68) and 9-10 PM (23.64), and peaking between 8-9 PM (24.7 deviation from mesor), suggesting a potentially inverted or shifted diurnal cardiovascular activity pattern during sleep preparation and early sleep phases. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score: -0.69), which is less than ideal, and a median sleep start time around 00:42:45, also suggesting late sleep onset. The standard deviation for sleep start time is also notable, indicating variability in bedtime.

The analysis of correlations between various metrics and CES-D scores provides further context. A significant positive correlation exists between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81), suggesting that higher anxiety is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, higher self-esteem (0.71), trust (0.41), and health satisfaction (0.39) are negatively correlated with CES-D, indicating these are protective factors against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress shows a moderate positive correlation (0.28). Among wearable metrics, higher resting heart rate and Mesor show a positive correlation (0.19), suggesting that elevated physiological arousal might be associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Considering the available data, the participant's profile presents a complex interplay of factors. While possessing protective traits such as high self-esteem and low anxiety, the presence of disturbed sleep, below-average happiness, and a blunted diurnal heart rate pattern during sleep preparation and early sleep phases, alongside a shorter sleep duration, are indicative of potential depressive symptomatology. The significant positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D, and the negative correlations of self-esteem and health satisfaction, further support the interpretation of these self-report measures in relation to depressive symptoms. The late sleep onset and reduced nocturnal heart rate variability during sleep suggest a disruption in normal circadian functioning that could contribute to elevated depressive symptomology. The strong positive correlation of STAI scores with CES-D and the negative correlations with self-esteem and health satisfaction, when considered alongside the physiological indicators of disrupted sleep and potentially shifted circadian rhythms, suggest a tendency towards elevated depressive symptoms. Given the PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"", the shortened sleep duration, and the pattern of heart rate deviation from the mesor during sleep, it is likely that this participant experiences a higher burden of depressive symptoms relative to the study population.

28312,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"This participant presents a complex profile of self-reported psychological states and objectively measured behaviors and physiological patterns, with several indicators warranting further consideration in relation to depressive symptomatology as measured by the CES-D. Self-reportedly, the participant exhibits higher-than-average anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score = 0.66) and a moderate level of perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.38), with a statistically significant positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D score (r=0.28). Conversely, self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES Z-score = -0.45) with a notable negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score = 1.05), aligning with a significant positive correlation to CES-D (r=0.36), indicating that poorer self-reported sleep quality is linked to elevated depressive symptoms. While happiness is reported slightly above average (Z-score = 0.55), its correlation with CES-D is negative (r=-0.46), implying higher happiness is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Trust levels are slightly below average (Z-score = -0.46) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.41). Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score = -0.2) with a negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.39).

Behaviorally, substance usage patterns for beer and wine/liquor are above the population average (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), though these have negligible correlations with CES-D. Exercise frequency is notably low, particularly in sports (Z-score = -1.09), and participation in ""Exercised Alone"" and ""Exercised with Others"" are also below average. However, exercise frequency and types show weak to negligible correlations with CES-D. Daily recreational habits reveal a mixed pattern: time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are close to average, while time spent on video games and listening to music are slightly below average. Socializing with friends is close to average, and reading and engagement in sedentary hobbies are below average. Of these, internet usage shows a modest positive correlation (r=0.25) with CES-D.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a heightened cardiovascular profile. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average Mesor (circadian rhythm average heart rate, Z-score = 1.3) and Amplitude (circadian rhythm variation, Z-score = 1.54), suggesting a generally more active physiological state or potentially increased arousal. The resting heart rate is also above average (Z-score = 0.42). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during evening and night hours (e.g., 5-6 PM: Z-score=1.65, 4-5 PM: Z-score=0.82, 3-4 PM: Z-score=1.07, 2-3 PM: Z-score=1.18, 9-10 PM: Z-score=0.65, 11-12 AM: Z-score=0.77), and significantly reduced heart rate during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z-score=-0.85, 4-5 AM: Z-score=-0.89, 5-6 AM: Z-score=-0.49). These deviations, particularly the pronounced evening and night elevations, have weak to moderate negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting that higher cardiovascular activity during these periods may be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Sleep statistics show a slightly longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score = 0.51) but a substantially more variable sleep start time (Z-score = -0.54). Intradaily variability in heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.11), while interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.33). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is notably high (Z-score = 0.9), suggesting strong daily rhythmicity in heart rate.

Considering the combined evidence, several factors point towards a higher depressive symptom burden. The elevated anxiety, perceived stress, and particularly the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D are significant indicators. Subjective sleep disturbance also correlates positively with CES-D. While some physiological measures like higher heart rate during certain periods show negative correlations with CES-D, these are weaker associations and may reflect a generally higher arousal rather than an absence of depressive symptoms. The low exercise frequency is also a potential behavioral correlate of depression, although its direct correlation with CES-D is minimal in this data. The confluence of psychological distress indicators (anxiety, stress, low self-esteem) and subjective sleep complaints, alongside a high STAI score and PSQI score, strongly suggests that this participant's CES-D score is likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

56805,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"The participant presents a complex profile with indicators suggesting a potential elevation in depressive symptomatology, although not universally across all metrics. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -2.11), suggesting a stable disposition not prone to anxious feelings. Conversely, self-esteem is notably high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-Score: 1.66) and happiness is also elevated (Happiness score Z-Score: 1.64), which are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-Score: -1.26) and moderate perceived stress (PSS Z-Score: -0.17), further mitigating concerns for immediate psychological distress.

However, several objective and behavioral indicators warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptoms. The median sleep duration is significantly shorter than the study population average (5 hours 33 minutes, Z-score: -2.02), strongly suggesting a pattern of insufficient sleep. This aligns with a high Intradaily Variability in heart rate (Value: 0.54, Z-Score: -0.04), which, while not extreme, indicates less consistent patterns throughout the day. The Mesor (average heart rate level) is also lower than the population average (64.45, Z-score: -1.3), and the Acrophase (peak heart rate time) is recorded in the mid-afternoon (3:10 PM), which might indicate a shift in diurnal activity patterns. Most notably, the participant exhibits a considerably lower resting heart rate (44.2, Z-score: -1.66) compared to the study population, which can sometimes be associated with reduced physiological arousal.

The participant engages in regular exercise, with a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" for both exercising alone and with others (Z-Scores: 0.32 and 1.23 respectively), and participation in sports at a similar frequency (Z-Score: 1.58). This level of physical activity is typically protective against depressive symptoms. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is also a positive indicator. Daily recreation habits lean towards lower engagement with passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: -0.62) and video games (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: 0.2), but also a lack of engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies, and limited time spent socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: -0.62). The significantly low internet usage (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: -1.83) is also noteworthy.

In summation, while the participant reports high self-esteem, happiness, and low anxiety, and engages in significant physical activity, the objectively measured short sleep duration and a somewhat irregular heart rate pattern throughout the day, along with a lower resting heart rate, suggest underlying physiological and behavioral patterns that could contribute to a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The low correlation coefficients observed for most metrics with CES-D scores do not strongly support or negate the influence of these individual variables on depressive symptoms, necessitating a holistic interpretation. Given the significant sleep deficit and indicators of reduced physiological arousal, which can be linked to symptoms of anhedonia and low energy often associated with depression, the evidence leans towards a higher CES-D score.

Self-reported data reveal moderate levels of trait anxiety (STAI score of 40, Z-score of -0.13) and perceived stress (PSS score of 21, Z-score of -0.17), suggesting a baseline disposition towards experiencing these states, although not exceptionally high relative to the study population. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably high (RSES score of 45, Z-score of 0.96), which typically acts as a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is reported at a moderate level (Current score of 3.0, Z-score of -0.53). Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.2), which could indicate a subjective awareness of well-being that may influence mood. Interpersonal trust is within the average range (Score of 3.17, Z-score of -0.14).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, which is above average for the study population (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively). This level of consumption shows negligible correlation with depressive symptoms. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all,"" which is below average and suggests no engagement in these potentially risky behaviors. Physical activity levels are mixed; while sports engagement is somewhat frequent (1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.91), solitary exercise is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score of -1.18) and exercise with others is completely absent (Not at all, Z-score of -1.58). Sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music are not engaged in at all, suggesting an avoidance of passive leisure. Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported as 1-2 hours daily, which are average engagement levels for these activities.

Physiological data from the wearable device presents a mixed picture concerning circadian rhythm and activity patterns. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle, is relatively low (Value of 67.3, Z-score of -0.91), as is the calculated amplitude (Value of 8.0, Z-score of -0.9), which might indicate a generally lower physiological arousal. The resting heart rate is also low (Value of 49.4, Z-score of -1.04), further supporting this observation. Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, is somewhat reduced (Value of 0.3, Z-score of -0.9), suggesting less consistency in daily activity patterns. Intradaily Variability is also below average (Value of 0.47, Z-score of -0.53), which could imply less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 4:08 PM. Mean aggregate deviations from the Mesor show significant elevations in heart rate during mid-morning hours (9-10 AM: Z-score of 2.2; 10-11 AM: Z-score of 1.43), which is unusual and contrasts with the generally lower activity levels during other parts of the day. Sleep duration is within the average range (Median 7 hours 14 minutes, Z-score of 0.06), with moderate variability (Standard Deviation of 94 minutes, Z-score of -0.15). The median sleep start time is late (01:28:38), with moderate variability (Standard Deviation of 89 minutes, Z-score of 0.13), indicating a somewhat irregular sleep schedule. The low incidence of napping (Mean Daily Naps of 0.07, Z-score of -0.02) suggests no significant use of naps to compensate for potential sleep deficits.

Considering the available CES-D population statistics, the mean CES-D score is 13.32, with a median of 11.5 and a 75th percentile of 18.0. The participant's self-reported high self-esteem and average to slightly below average levels of anxiety, stress, and happiness, coupled with moderate substance use and largely sedentary lifestyle with some structured activity (sports), suggest a profile that does not strongly indicate elevated depressive symptoms. The objective physiological data, while showing some irregularities in circadian rhythm and unusual morning heart rate spikes, does not directly point to widespread physiological dysfunction typically associated with high CES-D scores. The relatively normal sleep duration and lack of frequent napping also do not suggest significant sleep disturbances indicative of severe depression. Without a direct CES-D score for this participant, the interpretation relies on the correlations provided. The modest negative correlations with self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction, while positive, are not substantial enough to override the interpretation of higher self-esteem and average stress/anxiety levels. The negligible correlations with most behavioral and physiological metrics further limit the ability to infer a high CES-D score. Therefore, the evidence leans towards a CES-D score that is not in the upper range of the distribution.

47142,19.0,0.7616580310880829,"The participant exhibits several behavioral and physiological patterns that warrant close examination in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-report data indicate a moderate level of chronic anxiety as measured by the STAI (Z-score = 0.17), with a positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is moderately lower than the population average (Z-score = -0.45) and exhibits a moderate negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are within the average range for the population (Z-score = -0.44) and show a modest positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D scores. Subjective well-being, as indicated by the 'Happy' score, is also below average (Z-score = -0.53) with a negative correlation (-0.46), aligning with the expectation that lower happiness is linked to higher depression. Health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score = -0.95) with a negative correlation (-0.39). Notably, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (Z-score = -1.26), which is contrary to what might be expected with elevated depressive symptoms; however, this measure reflects subjective perception.

Wearable-derived data reveal significant patterns in sleep and circadian rhythm regulation. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 32 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -0.81) and shows a near-zero correlation with CES-D scores (0.0). The variability in sleep duration and sleep start times are within average to slightly below average ranges (Z-scores = -0.32 and -0.31 respectively), suggesting some consistency in sleep patterns despite the shorter duration. However, the presence of a relatively high mean number of daily naps (Z-score = 2.66) is a notable deviation. In terms of circadian rhythm metrics, the participant's heart rate exhibits a higher than average MESOR (basal heart rate, Z-score = 1.32) and a moderately higher than average resting heart rate (Z-score = 0.83), both of which have modest positive correlations with CES-D scores. The amplitude of heart rate variation is within the average range (Z-score = 0.31), but the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (5:06 PM), indicating a typical circadian timing for peak heart rate. The interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score = 1.08), suggesting some regularity in daily cycles, whereas intradaily variability is below average (Z-score = -1.31), indicating less fluctuation within a day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also notably high (Z-score = 1.48), suggesting strong day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns. Analysis of hourly deviations from the mesor reveals generally lower than average heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 2 AM to 6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.35 to -0.76), and higher than average heart rates during the evening and night hours (e.g., 7 PM to 10 PM, with Z-scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.59), suggesting a potential shift in the daily pattern of physiological arousal.

Considering the combined evidence, the participant presents a complex profile. While subjective sleep quality is reported as good, objective sleep duration is below average, and there is a notable increase in daily naps. Lower self-esteem, higher chronic anxiety, and lower self-reported happiness are concerning indicators that correlate with higher CES-D scores. The elevated MESOR and resting heart rate, along with the atypical distribution of heart rate deviation across the day, might also contribute to a higher symptom burden. Although interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation suggest some regularity, the lower intradaily variability and the pattern of heart rate deviation might reflect underlying physiological dysregulation. Given the combination of lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, decreased happiness, and objective sleep duration deficits, alongside some physiological markers suggestive of altered arousal patterns, the evidence leans towards a higher depressive symptom burden. Therefore, the participant is likely to be in the top 50% of the study population in terms of CES-D scores.

This is further supported by the participant's STAI score falling within the average range for the study population (Z-score = 0.07). Conversely, a moderate negative correlation is observed between self-esteem and CES-D score (r = -0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is linked to increased depressive symptoms.

Interpersonal trust also shows a negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.41), and the participant's score is above average (Z-score = 1.15), suggesting higher trust might buffer depressive symptoms, though the correlation is not exceptionally strong. Self-reported happiness is negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46), with the participant reporting slightly above-average happiness (Z-score = 0.55). Perceived stress demonstrates a modest positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.28), and the participant's stress levels are slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17).

Socializing with friends and reading are also less frequent than average (Z-scores of -0.62 and -0.67 respectively).

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data provide further insights. The participant's interdaily stability (IS) of heart rate is below average (Z-score = -0.24), suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns. Intradaily variability (IV) is notably low (Z-score = -1.45), indicating a flattened daily pattern of heart rate fluctuations, which can sometimes be associated with reduced arousal or depression. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z-score = 1.57), suggesting a strong day-to-day consistency in the heart rate rhythm. The participant's mesor (average heart rate level) is below the population average (Z-score = -1.11), as is their resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.04), implying a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is close to average (Z-score = -0.2), and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (5:52 PM). Analysis of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours, with particularly pronounced negative deviations between 3-6 AM, and higher heart rate deviations in the evening, peaking between 8-9 PM. This pattern suggests a delayed or blunted diurnal variation in heart rate. Sleep statistics indicate a slightly longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score = 0.26), but a more variable sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score = -0.66), and more variable sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score = -0.69). The median sleep start time is late (01:46:00).

The participant's overall CES-D score distribution would likely fall in the **bottom_50** of the study population. While elevated anxiety (STAI) and below-average self-esteem correlate with higher CES-D scores, other factors appear to buffer against this. The participant reports moderate happiness, slightly below-average stress, and above-average interpersonal trust, all of which are associated with lower CES-D scores. Their exercise habits, particularly exercising with others frequently, and social engagement with friends, even if less frequent, suggest a degree of social connection which can be protective. Furthermore, the physiological data, while showing some irregularities like low intradaily variability and lower mesor and resting heart rate, do not strongly indicate a significantly elevated level of depressive symptomatology on their own. The sleep duration is slightly longer than average, and while sleep start times are variable, it doesn't present a clear pattern of severe sleep disturbance that is consistently linked to high CES-D scores. The combination of these factors, especially the negative correlations with self-esteem and anxiety being offset by positive factors like trust and moderate happiness, suggests that the participant's CES-D score is likely within the lower half of the distribution.

92412,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally positive psychological and behavioral indicators, yet with some notable deviations. Self-report measures indicate low anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.92) and high self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score: 0.82), with a score of 44.0. Subjective happiness is also high (Z-score: 1.64), and perceived stress is notably low (Z-score: -1.53). Sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Z-score: -1.26). Interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.46). The participant reports a healthy Body Mass Index of 20.0 and a high satisfaction with their health (Z-score: 0.63). In terms of substance usage, the participant reports abstaining from alcohol and recreational or non-prescribed drugs, with all corresponding Z-scores being negative, indicating lower-than-average usage. Physical activity is robust, with frequent engagement in exercising alone and with others (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-scores: 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), and moderate participation in sports. Daily recreation habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with lower engagement in video games, listening to music, and significantly less time spent socializing with friends. The participant also reports not engaging in reading or other sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals a heart rate profile with a notably lower-than-average Mesor (Mean 67.41, Z-score: -0.89) and resting heart rate (Mean 53.0, Z-score: -0.61), suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is relatively high (Mean 13.08, Z-score: 0.74), indicating a greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Circadian rhythm stability, as indicated by Interdaily Stability (Mean 0.43, Z-score: 0.17) and Intradaily Variability (Mean 0.66, Z-score: 0.81), falls within or slightly above the average range for the population, suggesting a moderately structured daily rhythm. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights a distinct pattern of elevated heart rate during the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 5-6 PM (Deviation 39.22, Z-score: 4.19) and 6-7 PM (Deviation 25.03, Z-score: 2.17). Conversely, nocturnal heart rates tend to be lower than the mesor, especially in the early morning hours. Sleep duration is above average (Median 7 hours 48 minutes, Z-score: 0.76), with relatively consistent sleep durations (Standard Deviation 62 minutes, Z-score: -0.87). The median sleep start time is around 1 AM, with moderate variability in sleep start times. There are no reported naps.

The participant's data suggests a predominantly positive psychological and behavioral profile. Low reported anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness, coupled with low perceived stress and good subjective sleep quality, are indicators associated with lower depressive symptomatology. The robust engagement in exercise and abstention from substance use further support this notion. While the participant engages in moderate screen time and internet usage, their overall lifestyle appears healthy. The slightly below-average interpersonal trust and limited time spent socializing with friends are potential areas of concern, but not strongly correlated with CES-D scores in this dataset. The physiological data, particularly the lower resting heart rate and Mesor, may reflect a generally calm physiological state. The pronounced peak in heart rate during the late afternoon/early evening, however, deviates from typical patterns and warrants consideration, although its correlation with CES-D is near zero. The relatively stable sleep patterns and above-average sleep duration are generally positive indicators. Given the preponderance of positive self-report measures and healthy lifestyle habits, it is likely that this participant's CES-D score falls within the lower half of the study population.

Anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (Z-score: -1.02), suggesting a stable disposition towards not experiencing anxiety. This contrasts with a significantly high self-esteem score (Z-score: 1.66), implying a strong sense of self-worth. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score: -0.33), aligning with the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" Perceived stress levels, measured by the PSS, are within the average range (Z-score: -0.44). Interpersonal trust is moderately elevated (Z-score: 0.5), suggesting a generally trusting disposition. Self-reported happiness is also notably high (Z-score: 1.64). Health satisfaction is also elevated (Z-score: 1.3).

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in substance use (beer and wine/liquor) with a frequency of 1-2 times per week, which is higher than the population average (Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94 respectively). Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is relatively high, with exercise (alone and with others) occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores: 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), while participation in sports is absent. Daily recreational habits show a pattern of lower engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games (Z-scores: -1.25 and -0.56 respectively), and minimal internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.16). There is also minimal engagement in listening to music and sedentary hobbies. Conversely, reading is reported as ""16-30 minutes"" (Z-score: 1.3), suggesting a preference for more active or engaging leisure activities. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, which is around the population average (Z-score: 0.16).

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal moderate regularity in heart rate patterns. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.16), suggesting some variability in daily rhythm consistency. Intradaily variability is elevated (Z-score: 1.23), indicating more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z-score: -0.87), implying a weakened day-to-day predictability of the heart rate rhythm. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.08). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Z-score: 0.99), suggesting larger daily swings in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is observed around 5:12 PM. Resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score: -0.56).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. The most pronounced deviations from the Mesor occur in the late afternoon and early evening. Specifically, the hours of 3-4 PM (Z-score: 2.24) and 4-5 PM (Z-score: 2.45) show the largest positive deviations, indicating elevated heart rate activity during these periods. Other notable periods of elevated heart rate include 7-8 PM (Z-score: 1.16) and 5-6 PM (Z-score: 0.88). Conversely, the deepest depressions from the Mesor occur in the early morning hours, particularly between 2-3 AM (Z-score: -0.55) and 3-4 AM (Z-score: -0.7), and further into the morning from 8-9 AM (Z-score: -1.54). There are also significant negative deviations between 9-10 PM (Z-score: -1.3) and 10-11 PM (Z-score: -0.7). This pattern suggests a robust diurnal variation in heart rate.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 36 minutes, which is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.52). However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is high (Z-score: 1.0), suggesting considerable nightly variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:27 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score: 0.69), indicating some inconsistency in sleep onset timing. The average daily nap frequency is zero (Z-score: -0.86), suggesting no napping behavior.

Overall, the participant exhibits a mix of positive psychological traits, such as high self-esteem and happiness, coupled with moderately elevated interpersonal trust and health satisfaction. While anxiety is low and perceived stress is average, subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed, and there is notable variability in sleep duration. Behavioral patterns include moderate substance use, high engagement in physical activity, and a preference for more active leisure pursuits. Circadian rhythm data suggest a strong diurnal heart rate variation with a high amplitude, indicating significant daily fluctuations, alongside slightly less consistent daily patterns and a below-average resting heart rate. The correlations provided offer supplementary insights, with negative correlations between CES-D scores and higher self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, suggesting these factors may be associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Conversely, the positive correlation between CES-D and perceived stress suggests higher stress is linked to more depressive symptoms. The moderate negative correlation with interpersonal trust also suggests that higher trust may be associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Considering the provided data, several factors point towards a potentially lower CES-D score. The participant reports high levels of self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66), high happiness (Z-score: 1.64), and high health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.3). These factors are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the provided data, suggesting they are protective against depressive symptomatology. While sleep quality is reported as disturbed, and there is variability in sleep duration, the median sleep duration is slightly above average. Low anxiety (Z-score: -1.02) and average perceived stress (Z-score: -0.44) also contribute to an assessment of lower depressive burden. The presence of moderate interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.5) also shows a negative correlation with CES-D.

Conversely, moderate engagement in substance use (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) and the noted variability in sleep duration could be indicators of potential underlying difficulties that might contribute to depressive symptoms. However, these are not as strongly indicative of high depressive symptomatology as the consistently high positive self-report measures and their associated negative correlations with CES-D are indicative of lower symptomatology. The elevated intradaily variability in heart rate and low autocorrelation at 24 hours, while indicating some irregularity, do not directly correlate with CES-D in a manner that strongly suggests elevated depressive symptoms in this dataset.

Synthesizing these findings, the overwhelmingly positive self-reported psychological states (high self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) and their strong negative correlations with CES-D are the most compelling indicators. These suggest a resilience that likely places the participant in the lower half of the CES-D distribution.

86440,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"The participant exhibits a moderate level of subjective distress and several behavioral patterns that warrant attention in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-reported anxiety (STAI) falls within the non-anxious range (Z-score = -0.33), and self-esteem is slightly below average but not critically low (Z-score = -0.17), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D score, suggesting higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is notably low (Z-score = -0.71), correlating positively with CES-D score, indicating that higher perceived stress is associated with higher depressive symptoms, which is a common finding. General happiness is also slightly below average (Z-score = 0.55, negatively correlated), and health satisfaction is near the population mean (Z-score = -0.12). Interpersonal trust is above average (Z-score = 0.5), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D score, suggesting higher trust is linked to lower depressive symptoms. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as disturbed (Z-score = 0.13), with a positive correlation to CES-D score, aligning with the expectation that poorer sleep quality is associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Behavioral habits indicate a generally sedentary lifestyle with limited engagement in certain activities. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported as ""Not at all,"" with significantly low Z-scores, and very weak correlations to CES-D. Exercise frequency is low, particularly for exercising alone (Z-score = -1.18), while engaging in sports is more frequent (Z-score = 0.91). Daily recreational activities show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and listening to music, with slight positive correlations to CES-D in some instances, suggesting these behaviors may be associated with higher depressive symptoms or are used as coping mechanisms. Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level (1-2 hours), with a near-zero correlation to CES-D. Reading is notably infrequent (""Do not do,"" Z-score = -0.67).

Physiological and circadian rhythm data reveal some notable patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score = -0.85), and the overall Mesor of their heart rate circadian rhythm is also significantly lower than the population mean (Z-score = -1.27), suggesting a generally lower basal physiological arousal. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is also below average (Z-score = -0.6), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.16), suggesting some variability in daily regularity, while intradaily variability is near the population average (Z-score = 0.1). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.48), indicating a moderate level of consistency in daily heart rate patterns. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates pronounced dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (2 AM to 6 AM), with the most significant negative deviations occurring between 4 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 5-6 AM: -18.92 deviation, Z-score = -0.08). Conversely, heart rate deviations are generally higher and positive during the late morning and afternoon, peaking between 1 PM and 3 PM (e.g., 2-3 PM: 13.65 deviation, Z-score = 1.22). This pattern suggests a delayed or blunted wakefulness response and a potentially prolonged period of reduced physiological activation in the morning, followed by a peak in arousal in the early afternoon.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 1 minute, which is close to the population average, with a slight negative correlation to CES-D score suggesting longer sleep is associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, the sleep start time is late, with a median of 00:49:59, and a significantly low standard deviation (Z-score = -0.7), suggesting a consistent but late sleep onset. This late sleep onset, coupled with disturbed subjective sleep quality, may contribute to overall fatigue and impact daytime functioning. The absence of naps and generally low mean daily naps (Z-score = -0.86) does not suggest excessive daytime sleepiness as a primary concern, but rather a pattern of consolidated but late sleep.

Considering the provided data and correlations with CES-D, the participant exhibits several indicators of elevated depressive symptomatology. Specifically, disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI), lower self-esteem, and potentially lower happiness all correlate positively with CES-D scores. The pronounced early morning dips in heart rate deviations, indicative of prolonged periods of low physiological arousal during typical waking hours, alongside a late sleep onset, could suggest disruptions in circadian rhythmicity associated with depressive states. While some measures like perceived stress are low, and trust is high, these do not negate the presence of other risk factors. The overall profile suggests a participant who, while not exhibiting extreme scores on all measures, presents a constellation of symptoms and behavioral patterns that lean towards the higher end of the CES-D distribution.

Self-reported anxiety (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score 0.17) is within the average range for the population, though it shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is at the maximum possible score (40.0, Z-score 0.26) and demonstrates a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Subjective happiness is reported at a moderate level (4.0, Z-score 0.55) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.46). Perceived stress is slightly below average (21.0, Z-score -0.17) and shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.28). Interpersonal trust is relatively high (3.67, Z-score 0.83), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.41). Health satisfaction is also above average (4.56, Z-score 0.22) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.39).

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant engages in regular substance use, with beer consumption occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.72), and wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.94). Recreational drug use is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score 1.61), and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all (Z-score -0.11). In terms of exercise, the participant exercises alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32) but engages in exercise with others more frequently, three times a week or more (Z-score 1.23). Sports participation is also noted at 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91). Daily recreational activities involve moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and significant time spent on video games (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score 1.71). Internet usage is reported as 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score -0.49), while listening to music is infrequent (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.72). Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours (Z-score 0.16), and reading for 15 minutes or less (Z-score 0.32). Sedentary hobbies occupy 16-30 minutes (Z-score 0.23). Notably, the usage patterns of beer, wine/liquor, and video games show very low correlations with CES-D scores, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use have very slight positive correlations.

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, indicated by an Interdaily Stability value of 0.46 (Z-score 0.42) and an Intradaily Variability value of 0.5 (Z-score -0.32). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.19, Z-score -1.12), suggesting less strong daily periodicity in heart rate. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below population average (69.94, Z-score -0.55), and the Amplitude is close to average (10.89, Z-score 0.04). The Acrophase occurs in the evening at 7:39 PM. The resting heart rate is notably low (52.0, Z-score -0.73), which may be influenced by physical fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of deviation from the Mesor. There are significant deviations during the late night and early morning hours, with particularly high positive deviations between 12-1 AM (9.13, Z-score 1.56) and 7-8 PM (23.64, Z-score 2.12), and a sharp increase from 6 PM onwards. Conversely, there are substantial negative deviations between 8-9 AM (-21.43, Z-score -1.67) and 1-2 PM (-3.86, Z-score -2.41). These patterns suggest periods of elevated physiological arousal in the evening and early morning, and periods of lower than average heart rate during typical waking hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score -1.25), which is below average and shows a negative correlation with CES-D scores. The variability in sleep duration is slightly above average (107 minutes, Z-score 0.15). The median sleep start time is very early (04:31:59), with a standard deviation in start time that is below average (66 minutes, Z-score -0.37), implying a more consistent, albeit early, sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is zero (Z-score -0.86), which is below average.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant's self-reported data presents a mixed picture regarding depressive symptomatology. While self-esteem is high (maximum score) and happiness and health satisfaction are above average, there are some indicators that could correlate with elevated CES-D scores. Anxiety levels are within the average range, but their strong positive correlation with CES-D is noteworthy. Perceived stress is slightly below average, with a weak positive correlation. Interpersonal trust is relatively high, which typically is associated with lower depressive symptoms.

The wearable data reveals a below-average sleep duration, which is a consistent correlate of depressive symptoms. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows pronounced deviations from the Mesor, with significant increases in heart rate during late evening and early morning hours, and marked decreases during typical waking hours. These patterns, especially the reduced heart rate during the day, could suggest reduced physiological engagement.

The correlation between median sleep duration and CES-D score is -0.0, meaning that shorter sleep duration in this dataset is not directly correlated with CES-D scores. However, a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score -1.25) is significantly below the population average, and insufficient sleep is a common manifestation of depressive symptomatology.

Considering the strong negative correlation of self-esteem with CES-D scores and the high self-esteem score, this participant has a protective factor. However, the significantly shorter sleep duration and the pronounced fluctuations in hourly heart rate, especially the reduced heart rate during the day, along with moderate levels of happiness and slightly elevated anxiety, suggest that the participant may experience some level of depressive symptomatology.

The population mean CES-D score is 13.31, with a median of 11.0. Given the significant sleep deficit and the mixed but leaning towards negative self-perception regarding happiness and stress, alongside the strong negative correlation of self-esteem, it is plausible that this participant's overall CES-D score would fall in the upper half of the distribution, indicating a moderate to high burden of depressive symptoms. The protective factor of high self-esteem is strong, but the objective sleep data and certain self-report measures lean towards a higher CES-D score.

Their reported happiness is above average (Happy Z-score = 0.55), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (r = -0.46), suggesting higher happiness may be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is at a lower than average level (Stress Z-score = -0.44), and this is weakly positively correlated with CES-D scores (r = 0.28). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score = -0.33), a finding with a low correlation to CES-D scores (no correlation provided). Interpersonal trust is notably low (Trust Z-score = -0.78) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.41). Health satisfaction is also below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -0.53) with a negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.39).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in minimal substance use and exercises infrequently, particularly with others. They report not exercising alone (Exercised Alone Z-score = -0.43), never exercising with others (Exercised with Others Z-score = -1.58), and not participating in sports (Sports Z-score = -1.09). Their daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate video game usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score = 0.96), internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.18), and sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.41). Notably, socializing with friends is very limited (16-30 minutes, Z-score = -1.41), with a negligible correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.01). Listening to music is also limited (15 minutes or less, Z-score = -0.72), and reading is done for 15 minutes or less (Z-score = 0.32).

Physiological data from the wearable reveals several patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate intraday variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score = 0.67), suggesting a less erratic but still dynamic daily physiological cycle. Interdaily stability is within the average range (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 0.33). The Mesor, representing average heart rate, is close to the population mean (Mesor Z-score = 0.05). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average (Amplitude Z-score = 0.53), indicating a larger difference between peak and trough heart rates, which is negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.10). The acrophase, the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is observed around 4:54 PM. The resting heart rate is lower than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.47), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (r = 0.19). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significant dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z-score = -0.87; 3-4 AM, Z-score = -0.79; 4-5 AM, Z-score = -0.67; 5-6 AM, Z-score = -1.11), suggesting a prolonged period of lower physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, evenings show notable elevations in heart rate deviation, particularly between 6-7 PM (Z-score = 1.65) and 7-8 PM (Z-score = 0.52), which are negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.10 and r = -0.05, respectively). Sleep statistics reveal a consistently short median sleep duration (6 hours 3 minutes, Z-score = -1.41), with high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation Z-score = 0.74) and sleep start times (Standard Deviation Z-score = 1.14). The median sleep start time is late, at approximately 1:47 AM.

Considering the confluence of factors, the participant exhibits a lower than average resting heart rate and a higher than average heart rate amplitude, which are weakly correlated with lower CES-D scores. However, the marked deficit in social interaction, low interpersonal trust, low self-esteem, and disturbed sleep, alongside a shorter than average sleep duration, are all indicators that tend to be associated with higher depressive symptomology. The elevated heart rate deviations in the evening might reflect a period of increased physiological arousal preceding sleep, potentially contributing to the observed sleep difficulties. The strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, coupled with lower than average self-esteem, suggests a predisposition towards higher depressive symptoms. While some physiological metrics like resting heart rate and amplitude lean towards lower symptom burden, the pervasive subjective experiences of low trust and self-esteem, combined with significant sleep disturbances and social withdrawal, strongly suggest a higher overall CES-D score. The population mean CES-D score is 13.31, with a median of 11.0 and the 75th percentile at 18.0. The participant's reported low self-esteem (Z-score = -0.59) and low trust (Z-score = -0.78) are strongly indicative of a CES-D score in the upper half of the distribution, as these are often strongly associated with depressive symptomatology.

Daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities, with low reported engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of -0.62), video games (Z-score of -0.56), internet usage (Z-score of -1.16), and listening to music (Z-score of -0.72). Notably, social interaction with friends is reported for a very limited duration (Z-score of -1.41), and sedentary hobbies and reading are not engaged in (Z-scores of -0.96 and -0.67 respectively). This pattern suggests a potential deficit in more actively engaging or socially oriented leisure activities.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant displays a generally regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.4) are high, indicating a consistent daily pattern in activity and heart rate. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly elevated (Z-score of 2.26), suggesting robust daily fluctuations in physiological activity. However, intradaily variability is notably low (Z-score of -2.08), implying a less dynamic heart rate pattern within the day, which could be indicative of reduced physiological arousal during waking hours. The resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.61). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced peak in deviation from the mesor during the afternoon, particularly between 3-4 PM (Z-score of 3.82) and 4-5 PM (Z-score of 2.10), followed by a tapering off. Conversely, significant negative deviations, indicative of lower than average heart rate, are observed during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z-score of -1.62). Sleep duration is slightly longer than average (Z-score of 1.1) with a stable start time (standard deviation Z-score of 0.53), and no reported daily naps.

Considering the overall pattern, the participant presents with a contradictory profile. While self-reported measures of anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, and trust are largely positive and inversely correlated with depressive symptoms, behavioral data suggests a tendency towards passive leisure and limited social interaction. The physiological data indicates a stable but potentially less arousing daily rhythm, with a strong afternoon peak in heart rate. The CES-D population statistics indicate a median score of 11.5 and a 75th percentile of 18.0. Given the strong positive self-report measures, particularly high self-esteem and happiness, and low anxiety, which are typically strong protective factors against depression, it is likely that the participant's overall CES-D score would fall below the median of the study population.

The participant reports generally good academic performance, with a GPA around 2.9-3.0. Subjective sleep quality is indicated as ""Disturbed Sleep"" by the PSQI (Z-score: 0.13), although this score is only marginally above the average threshold for disturbance. Interpersonal trust is reported at a slightly above-average level (Trust Z-score: 0.18) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D. Self-reported happiness is at a slightly below-average level (Happy Z-score: -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting that lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is at a below-average level (Stress Z-score: -0.44) with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.53), with a weak negative correlation to CES-D.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports frequent beer consumption (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.72) and moderate wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94), with negligible correlations to CES-D. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise habits are moderate, with activity 1-2 times a week both alone and with others, and sports participation 1-2 times a month, showing weak negative correlations to CES-D. Daily recreation includes significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score: 1.13), both exhibiting weak positive correlations with CES-D, indicating these activities may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Video games, internet usage, and socializing with friends are engaged in for moderate durations, with video game and internet usage showing minimal correlation to CES-D, while socializing shows a near-zero correlation. The participant does not engage in reading or other sedentary hobbies.

Physiological and behavioral data from the wearable device reveal significant indicators of disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep patterns. Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -1.98) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.8) are notably low, suggesting a lack of regularity in daily activity patterns and a flattened circadian rhythm, respectively. These metrics show weak negative correlations with CES-D. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.29) is also low, further supporting poor circadian rhythmicity. The participant's Mesor (average heart rate) is within the average range (Z-score: -0.35), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is somewhat reduced (Z-score: -1.16), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon/early evening. Resting heart rate is within the average range (Z-score: -0.48).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates prolonged periods of reduced cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am Z-score: 0.92, 4-5 am Z-score: 0.72, 5-6 am Z-score: 0.44), followed by a gradual increase in heart rate during the morning and a peak in the early evening hours (e.g., 7-8 pm Z-score: 13.29, 9-10 pm Z-score: 9.68). Notably, there are substantial deviations from the mesor during nighttime hours, with some values reaching Z-scores above 0.9, which is unusual and potentially indicative of fragmented sleep or physiological disturbances during this period. Conversely, daytime heart rate activity generally stays closer to the mesor, with some positive deviations during the afternoon and early evening. There are moderate negative correlations between some of these hourly heart rate deviations and CES-D scores, particularly during afternoon and evening hours, suggesting that a more active heart rate during these times might be associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 39 minutes (Z-score: -0.66), which is slightly below average but not extreme. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also within the average range. However, the median sleep start time is very late (02:10:59), with a standard deviation of 88 minutes, suggesting significant variability and a delayed sleep phase. The mean number of daily naps is notably high (Z-score: 2.07), indicating a potential compensatory behavior or a sign of fatigue, and this metric shows a moderate positive correlation with CES-D.

Holistically, the participant presents with several indicators that lean towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The significant disruption in circadian rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability and intradaily variability), coupled with a very late and variable sleep start time and frequent napping, are strong indicators of potential sleep disturbance and dysregulation, which are commonly associated with depression. While self-esteem is relatively high and anxiety is low, the below-average self-reported happiness and the engagement in high-frequency passive recreational activities like watching TV and listening to music, which are weakly correlated with higher CES-D scores, further support this. The frequent alcohol consumption, though not strongly correlated, is also a factor to consider. The sleep duration is only mildly reduced, but the timing and fragmentation of sleep, along with the high rate of napping, are concerning. Given the pronounced irregularities in circadian rhythm and sleep patterns, alongside the indicators of lower mood and potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms (excessive passive screen time, frequent naps), the evidence suggests a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms.

The participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported psychological states and behavioral patterns, alongside wearable-derived physiological data. Self-report measures indicate a neutral level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.03) and slightly below average self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score of -0.31), with a modest positive correlation to their CES-D score. Interpersonal trust is notably lower than the study average (Trust Z-score of -0.46, with a negative correlation to CES-D), suggesting potential difficulties in social connection. Happiness levels are also below average (Happy Z-score of -0.53), aligning with the trust metric. Perceived stress is elevated (Stress Z-score of 0.65), showing a mild positive association with depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is exceptionally high (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 1.3), which is incongruent with other psychological indicators. Substance usage is generally low, with no reported use of beer or recreational drugs, and infrequent wine or liquor consumption (Wine or Liquor Z-score of 0.94), exhibiting negligible correlation with CES-D. Exercise habits are characterized by regular solo exercise (Exercised Alone Frequency 'Three times a week or more', Z-score of 1.07) but minimal exercise with others or participation in sports (Exercised with Others Frequency 'Not at all', Z-score of -1.58; Sports Frequency 'Not at all', Z-score of -1.09), with a mild negative correlation to CES-D for exercising with others. Daily recreational habits involve significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.28) and moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85), both showing weak positive correlations with CES-D. Socializing with friends is at an average level (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.16), with a near-zero correlation.

Wearable data reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of -1.04), suggesting good baseline cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a lower than average Mesor (Mesor Z-score of -1.54), potentially reflecting a lower overall daily physiological output. Interdaily stability of heart rate is also below average (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.49), suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns. Intradaily variability is near the population average (Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.04), implying a typical fluctuation of heart rate within a day. The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:17 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight several periods of notable cardiovascular activity. Notably, there are significant positive deviations during the late afternoon and early evening, specifically between 3-4 PM (Z-score of 1.78), 4-5 PM (Z-score of 2.34), and 5-6 PM (Z-score of 1.95), and a strong positive deviation between 7-8 PM (Z-score of 1.29). These periods of elevated heart rate may correlate with daily activities or physiological responses to perceived stress. Conversely, significant negative deviations occur during the early morning hours, from 2-3 AM to 6-7 AM, suggesting a period of reduced physiological arousal consistent with sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score of -0.48), which is slightly below the population average, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of 0.39). The median sleep start time is notably late, at 02:28:00 AM, with a considerable standard deviation (Z-score of 0.41), suggesting irregular sleep timing. Napping frequency is minimal.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant’s self-reported data presents a mixed picture regarding depressive symptomatology. While subjective happiness and interpersonal trust are below average, and self-esteem is slightly diminished, these factors are correlated with CES-D but do not definitively place the participant in the upper half. The elevated perceived stress is a potential indicator of elevated depressive symptoms, and its positive correlation with CES-D supports this. Conversely, high health satisfaction, neutral anxiety, and low substance usage are factors that might suggest a less severe depressive burden.

The wearable data reveals irregular sleep patterns, characterized by a late median sleep start time and moderate variability in both duration and timing. While median sleep duration is slightly below average, it is not severely restricted. The less stable interdaily heart rate variability and the lower Mesor might indicate a reduced level of overall daily physiological functioning. The significant elevations in heart rate during late afternoon, early evening, and evening could reflect periods of heightened arousal or stress responses that may be associated with depressive symptoms.

Considering the combined evidence, the slightly diminished self-esteem, lower trust, and below-average happiness, coupled with elevated perceived stress and irregular sleep timing, lean towards a CES-D score that is not in the lowest range. While not exhibiting extreme indicators, the pattern of reduced positive affect and increased perceived stress, alongside sleep dysregulation, suggests a moderate level of depressive symptomatology. The positive correlations with CES-D for perceived stress, internet usage, and watching TV/videos/movies, while not strong individually, contribute to a pattern suggestive of elevated symptoms. The absence of strong protective factors (e.g., high self-esteem, high happiness, very regular sleep) further supports this. Therefore, the participant likely falls within the upper half of the study population in terms of their CES-D score.

Subjectively, the participant reports average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.45), with moderate negative correlations to CES-D. While their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8) suggests ""Good Sleep"" subjectively, it borders on the threshold for potential disturbance.

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a mixed pattern. They engage in moderate consumption of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) and report moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.67), which show slight positive correlations with CES-D. Notably, they exhibit lower engagement in exercising with others (Less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.88) and sports (Not at all, Z-score -1.09), with negative correlations to CES-D. Conversely, higher engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and other sedentary hobbies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.82) is observed, showing positive correlations with CES-D. Substance usage, apart from alcohol, is minimal.

Wearable data reveals a less stable circadian rhythm characterized by low Interdaily Stability (Value 0.3, Z-score -0.9) and high Intradaily Variability (Value 0.78, Z-score 1.65), suggesting a disrupted daily routine and potential challenges in maintaining physiological regularity. The Mesor (Value 77.31, Z-score 0.46) and Resting Heart Rate (Value 66.1, Z-score 0.95) are slightly above population averages, but the Amplitude (Value 6.93, Z-score -1.25) is notably lower, indicating a reduced range in daily heart rate fluctuations. The Acrophase (4:54 PM) suggests a later peak in cardiovascular activity. Aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates significant deviations from the Mesor, particularly during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM exhibit substantial negative deviations), suggesting potential sleep disturbances or prolonged periods of low physiological arousal during these times. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 57 minutes (Z-score -0.29), which is slightly below average, and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Standard Deviation of 39 minutes, Z-score -0.97). The presence of mean daily naps (Value 0.12, Z-score 0.61) suggests potential daytime sleepiness.

Holistically, this participant exhibits several indicators associated with increased CES-D scores. Elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, and higher perceived stress are notable self-reported correlates. The behavioral patterns of reduced engagement in social exercise, increased sedentary screen time, and moderate alcohol consumption align with characteristics sometimes observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the objective measures of circadian rhythm instability (low Interdaily Stability, high Intradaily Variability) and reduced heart rate amplitude, coupled with significant negative deviations in heart rate during nocturnal hours, strongly suggest physiological dysregulation that is often linked to elevated depressive symptomatology. While subjective sleep quality is reported as good, the objective sleep duration is slightly low and the pattern of heart rate deviations during sleep hours warrants attention. These combined factors point towards a significant burden of depressive symptoms.

This participant presents a complex profile with certain indicators suggesting potential psychological distress, particularly in relation to self-perception and stress levels. Their self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score = 1.64), aligning with a relatively low anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score = -0.62). However, this contrasts with a significantly elevated perceived stress score (Z-score = 1.74), indicating a potential disconnect between internal affective states and the appraisal of life circumstances as stressful. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is also comparatively high (Z-score = 0.82), yet this is accompanied by a remarkably low score on interpersonal trust (Z-score = 2.75), suggesting a potential underlying wariness or difficulty in forming close social bonds despite positive self-regard. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.12).

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage and engages in exercise primarily 1-2 times a month, with more frequent sports participation (1-2 times a week). Their daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with less time dedicated to reading or socializing with friends. Notably, the participant reports no napping, which aligns with a lower than average median sleep duration (6 hours 34 minutes, Z-score = -0.76). However, the variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.62) and sleep start time (Z-score = 0.51) are notably elevated, suggesting irregularities in sleep patterns despite generally good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = -1.26). Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a relatively average mesor (heart rate mean) and amplitude. The hourly heart rate deviations indicate a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-7 AM, with Z-scores between -0.41 and -0.57), followed by a pronounced peak in deviation during the mid-afternoon (3-4 PM, Z-score = 1.61). Heart rate then gradually declines through the evening, with notably lower than average deviations observed between 8-9 PM (Z-score = -1.38). The intraday variability of heart rate is elevated (Z-score = 1.3), while interdaily stability is within the population norm. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late in the afternoon.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The provided data present several indicators that could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The high perceived stress (Z-score = 1.74) is a significant risk factor. Despite high self-reported happiness and self-esteem, the extremely low interpersonal trust (Z-score = 2.75) suggests potential social isolation or difficulties that often co-occur with depression. The irregular sleep patterns, particularly the high variability in sleep duration and start time, despite a relatively short overall sleep duration, are also commonly associated with mood disturbances. While the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, objective measures of sleep inconsistency can be indicative of underlying issues. The positive correlation between high perceived stress and CES-D score (0.29), and the negative correlations between self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction with CES-D score (observed through their respective correlations of -0.71, -0.46, and -0.39) further suggest that these factors may contribute to a higher CES-D score. Conversely, the low anxiety and good subjective sleep quality are factors that might suggest a lower CES-D score. However, considering the significant elevation in perceived stress and the notable deficit in interpersonal trust, alongside the sleep irregularity, the evidence leans towards a profile that may be associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms, placing the participant in the upper half of the CES-D score distribution.

Conversely, perceived stress is relatively low (Stress score of 20.0, Z-score -0.44), and self-esteem is within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 39.0, Z-score 0.11). A particularly salient finding is the exceptionally high self-reported happiness (Happy score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64), which stands in contrast to other psychological indicators. Subjective sleep quality is assessed as disturbed, with a PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-score -0.33), exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance.

Behavioral habits indicate moderate engagement in social activities, with 'Socializing with Friends' reported for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score 0.16) and 'Exercised with Others' occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-score -0.17). Exercise frequency is notable, with 'Exercised Alone' occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), suggesting a commitment to physical activity. Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of beer or recreational drugs, and occasional use of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94). Daily recreational habits show a tendency towards sedentary activities, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' and 'Listening to Music' each occupying approximately 31 minutes an hour (Z-scores 0.64 and 0.21 respectively). Internet usage is moderate at 1-2 hours (Z-score 0.18), while reading is infrequent (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32) and video game usage is reported as non-existent (Z-score -0.56).

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data reveal several significant patterns. Interdaily stability of heart rate is notably low (Value 0.32, Z-score -0.74), suggesting a lack of regularity in daily cardiovascular activity. This is accompanied by high intradaily variability (Value 0.76, Z-score 1.51), indicating substantial fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Value 70.67, Z-score -0.45), and the amplitude is also below average (Value 9.02, Z-score -0.57), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:31 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Value 59.8, Z-score 0.2). The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor highlights specific hourly patterns: pronounced negative deviations (indicating heart rates below the daily average) occur during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -14.51, Z-score 0.29; 4-5 AM: -15.46, Z-score 0.44; 5-6 AM: -16.25, Z-score 0.31), while the late morning and early afternoon show significantly elevated deviations (e.g., 11 AM-12 PM: 16.89, Z-score 1.71; 1-2 PM: 20.19, Z-score 2.10). These patterns suggest a disrupted circadian system with a pronounced dip in heart rate during sleep and a significant increase in arousal during waking hours. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score 0.79), which is above the population average, but the variability in sleep duration is also higher than average (Value 65 minutes, Z-score -0.81). The median sleep start time is late (23:58:59), with a relatively low standard deviation (28 minutes, Z-score -1.22), suggesting a consistent but late sleep schedule. The presence of a small number of daily naps (Mean 0.07, Z-score -0.02) is also noted.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's data presents a mixed picture, but certain indicators lean towards elevated depressive symptomatology. While self-reported happiness is exceptionally high and perceived stress is low, these may represent a facade or a disconnect from underlying experiences. The significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 6.0) and the objective findings of low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability in heart rate are consistent with disruptions often seen in depressive disorders. The marked reduction in heart rate during early morning hours, followed by significant post-wake arousal, suggests an atypical physiological response that could be indicative of an underlying mood disturbance and its impact on sleep-wake cycles. The moderate negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (r = -0.71) and the positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D score (r = 0.81) also suggest that lower self-esteem and higher anxiety would be associated with higher CES-D scores. Given these objective and subjective indicators of sleep disturbance, physiological dysregulation, and potential masked distress, it is plausible that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden places them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

Similarly, self-reported happiness is also below average for the population (Happy Z-score: -0.53). While interpersonal trust is slightly above the population mean (Trust Z-score: 0.18), overall health satisfaction is notably low (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2), and perceived stress is significantly elevated compared to peers (Stress Z-score: -1.53).

Daily recreational habits involve substantial time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06), socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.53), and moderate use of internet and watching TV/videos. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average.

Wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm characterized by a lower than average mesor (Mesor Z-score: -0.31) and resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.26), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal state at rest. The amplitude of heart rate variation is slightly above average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.2), indicating a typical range of daily physiological fluctuation. Acrophase, representing the peak of heart rate activity, occurs in the late afternoon (4:43 PM). Interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly below average (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.24), and intradaily variability is also lower than average (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -0.74), suggesting a less dynamic hourly fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Sleep onset time is relatively late, with a median start time of 01:34:59 and a standard deviation indicating some variability in sleep timing (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.05). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows periods of significant deviation from the mesor, particularly during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -13.39, 3-4 AM: -19.96, 4-5 AM: -22.31), and pronounced increases during the evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM: 17.3, 7-8 PM: 18.13). These evening peaks are particularly notable when compared to the overall lower resting heart rate.

Considering the available evidence in conjunction with the population-level CES-D distribution (Mean: 13.32, SD: 9.62, 50th percentile: 11.5), the participant's profile suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While self-reported anxiety and self-esteem are within average to slightly better ranges, a high level of perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -1.53) and low health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2) are indicative of negative affect. The subjective classification of disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score: -0.33) further supports this. The significant evening heart rate elevations, particularly in conjunction with a lower overall mesor and resting heart rate, may reflect physiological stress responses or anticipation of negative stimuli. The notable negative correlations between CES-D score and self-esteem (-0.71), happiness (-0.46), and trust (-0.41), combined with a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28), strongly suggest that lower self-esteem, happiness, and trust, along with higher stress, are associated with higher CES-D scores within this study population. The participant's high frequency of socialising with friends (Z-score: 2.53) and listening to music (Z-score: 2.06) might represent coping mechanisms or time spent in activities that do not necessarily alleviate depressive symptoms. Given the elevated stress, disturbed sleep, and the strong negative correlations with key psychological well-being indicators, it is likely that the participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

They are, however, active in sports (Z-score = 1.58), spend a moderate amount of time on the internet (Z-score = 0.18), and engage in listening to music for 2-3 hours daily (Z-score = 1.13), which shows a modest positive correlation with CES-D. Socializing with friends is reported as 1-2 hours daily (Z-score = 0.16), with a near-zero correlation to CES-D.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a resting heart rate that is lower than average (Z-score = -0.42), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.18) and interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.16), both of which are slightly below average and show weak negative correlations with CES-D. The mesor and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm are also below average (Z-scores of -0.33 and -0.39, respectively), with weak correlations to CES-D. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, is reported as 3:34 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows generally lower-than-average activity during nocturnal and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM Z-score = -0.86; 4-5 AM Z-score = -0.63), with a slight increase in the late morning and afternoon. A notable deviation from the mesor is observed during the 7-8 AM hour (Z-score = 1.9), indicating a sharp increase in heart rate activity at this time, which has a very low negative correlation with CES-D.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is shorter than average (Z-score = -0.77) and shows a near-zero correlation with CES-D. The standard deviation for sleep duration is also below average (Z-score = -0.79), suggesting more consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is around midnight, with a standard deviation that is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.23), indicating some variability in sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is negligible.

Considering the pattern of lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and moderate perceived stress, coupled with a shorter-than-average sleep duration, the evidence suggests a profile leaning towards the higher end of the CES-D distribution. While some factors like higher trust and good subjective sleep quality might be protective, the combined impact of lower self-worth and happiness, alongside a tendency towards less consistent nocturnal heart rate patterns and reduced sleep duration, points towards a greater likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology. The positive correlations between CES-D and trait anxiety, perceived stress, internet usage, and listening to music, further support this.

71894,34.0,0.9559585492227979,"The participant presents with a notable constellation of self-reported psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful consideration in relation to their potential depressive symptomatology. A prominent finding is the significantly elevated score on the STAI Trait scale (Z-score = 2.24), indicating a high level of chronic anxiety. This is coupled with a substantially low score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z-score = -2.7), suggesting very low self-worth. The participant also reports low happiness (Z-score = -1.61) and below-average satisfaction with their health (Z-score = -1.95). While perceived stress levels are within the population norm (Z-score = 0.1), the combination of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and low happiness is indicative of significant psychological distress. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, falls within the range of disturbed sleep (Score = 6.0, Z-score = -0.33), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.58). The variability in sleep duration is also notably lower than the population average (Z-score = -1.06), suggesting a more consistent, though potentially insufficient, sleep pattern.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits high levels of internet and music listening engagement, both exceeding 4 hours daily (Z-scores = 2.19 and 2.06, respectively). They also engage in social interaction with friends for 3-4 hours (Z-score = 1.74) but report engaging in sports and watching TV/movies not at all. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is within or above population norms. Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of wine/liquor or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, and infrequent beer consumption.

Physiologically, as derived from wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable pattern of heart rate variability, as indicated by an interdaily stability Z-score of 0.5 and an intradaily variability Z-score of 0.81. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated relative to the population norm (Z-score = 0.95). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (2:33 PM). Notably, the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows distinct patterns of elevated heart rate during morning hours (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z-score = 4.61; 6-7 AM, Z-score = 4.44) and suppressed heart rate during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score = -1.35; 2-3 AM, Z-score = -0.84). The resting heart rate itself is also slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.65). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is below average (Z-score = -0.75), suggesting a less pronounced fluctuation around the mesor.

Considering the comprehensive analysis of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics, particularly the pronounced anxiety, low self-esteem, and low happiness, alongside a borderline disturbed sleep quality, the evidence suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The elevated heart rate during morning hours and suppressed rates during the night might reflect disrupted sleep-wake cycles, often associated with depression. While some behavioral aspects like exercise and social engagement are positive, the strong indicators of negative psychological states are highly relevant to CES-D symptomatology. Given these factors, the participant's overall CES-D score is likely to fall within the higher range of the study population.

30453,31.0,0.9196891191709845,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with notable indicators related to anxiety, self-esteem, and sleep quality. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait subscale score of 51.0 places the participant at a Z-score of 0.96, indicating a higher-than-average proneness to chronic anxiety. This elevated anxiety is mirrored by a low self-esteem score (27.0, Z-score -1.57), suggesting a significant inverse relationship between perceived anxiety and self-worth. The participant reports low levels of happiness (Current score 2.0, Z-score -1.61), further supporting the presence of negative affect. While perceived stress is moderately elevated (Score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), it is not as pronounced as the anxiety and low happiness scores. Interpersonal trust is also reported at a lower than average level (Score 2.67, Z-score -1.1), which may correlate with the heightened anxiety and potentially influence social engagement. Health satisfaction is also somewhat diminished (Score 2.78, Z-score -1.11).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates significantly disturbed sleep, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 16.0 (Z-score 4.29), which is substantially higher than the population mean and commonly suggests clinically significant sleep disturbances. This subjective report is corroborated by objective wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 25 minutes (Z-score -0.96), which is below the typical recommendation. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is very late at 01:21:00, with a standard deviation of 95 minutes, suggesting irregular sleep timing. The average daily nap count is zero, indicating no compensatory napping behavior. The sedentary nature of some daily activities, such as watching TV/videos/movies for 15 minutes or less and engaging in video games not at all, is offset by significant engagement in listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and reading (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score 2.28). The participant also engages in exercise with others frequently (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23) and alone less often (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.32).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a higher than average resting heart rate (Value 67.5, Z-score 1.11). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals an interdaily stability of 0.3 (Z-score -0.9), suggesting a less regular daily pattern in heart rate, and an intradaily variability of 0.63 (Z-score 0.6), indicating moderate variability throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly elevated (Value 80.18, Z-score 0.85). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM with a deviation of -13.21 and 3-4 AM with -13.27), followed by a notable increase in heart rate deviation from approximately 8 AM onwards, peaking in the afternoon (e.g., 4-5 PM with a deviation of 12.18). This pattern suggests a transition from lower arousal in the early morning to higher physiological activity during daytime hours, which might be interrupted by the disrupted sleep schedule.

The participant's data collectively points towards elevated depressive symptomatology, driven by high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and significantly disturbed sleep. The CES-D population mean is 13.26 with a 50th percentile of 11.0. The PSQI score of 16.0 (Z-score 4.29) is a strong indicator of poor sleep quality, which is a core component of depressive symptomatology and often correlates with higher CES-D scores. The STAI trait anxiety score (Z-score 0.96) and low self-esteem (Z-score -1.57) also align with higher CES-D scores, as these psychological factors are strongly associated with depression. While some behavioral factors like frequent exercise with others and significant time spent reading are positive, the pronounced sleep disturbance and negative affect are more influential. Given the substantial deviations in self-reported mental health and objective sleep quality, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

66047,46.0,0.9948186528497409,"The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral markers, with several indicators suggesting potential areas of concern relevant to depressive symptomatology. High levels of chronic anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of 3.13 on the STAI-Trait scale, are a significant finding. This elevated anxiety is strongly correlated with CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting a shared underlying vulnerability or a synergistic effect between anxiety and depressive symptoms. Concurrently, the participant reports significantly low self-esteem (Z-score of -2.42), with a strong negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.7), which is a well-established correlate of depression. Subjective sleep quality is also compromised, with a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score of 1.52) classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and a notable positive correlation with CES-D scores. The participant also reports lower-than-average health satisfaction (Z-score of -2.28), further aligning with potential affective distress.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits several patterns that warrant attention. While substance usage and formal exercise are minimal, daily recreational habits show a marked tendency towards passive consumption of media, with ""more than 4 hours"" spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (Z-score 3.17) and ""more than 4 hours"" on the internet (Z-score 2.19). These high levels of screen time and internet usage are positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.1 and 0.24 respectively), potentially reflecting avoidance behaviors or a lack of engagement in more active pursuits. The reported absence of listening to music, despite a positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.27), is unusual given music's common association with mood regulation. Daily naps are also frequent (Z-score 2.4), which can be a symptom of fatigue or low energy, often associated with depression.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal some deviations from typical patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated (Z-score 1.22). The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows consistently higher heart rate activity during the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 10-11 PM: Z-score 0.65; 12-1 AM: Z-score 1.09; 1-2 AM: Z-score 1.34), followed by a significant dip in the early morning (e.g., 5-6 AM: Z-score 0.7; 6-7 AM: Z-score 0.15). This pattern suggests a disrupted diurnal cardiovascular rhythm, which can be linked to sleep disturbances and mood regulation issues. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurring at 6:35 PM is relatively late, further contributing to a potentially shifted circadian timing. Sleep duration itself, while averaging approximately 7 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score 0.08), shows a higher than average variability in start time (Z-score 0.22), indicating some inconsistency in sleep scheduling. Despite these deviations, measures of circadian rhythm regularity like Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.17) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.24) are relatively stable, suggesting the core rhythm structure is present, albeit with some temporal shifts and variability. The mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.85).

The constellation of high anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, increased passive leisure activities, frequent napping, and an elevated resting heart rate, coupled with a potentially disrupted diurnal cardiovascular pattern, collectively points towards a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The strong positive correlations of anxiety, disturbed sleep, and high screen time with CES-D scores, along with the strong negative correlation of self-esteem, provide substantial evidence for elevated symptomatology.

79834,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by generally low to average levels of self-reported anxiety and high self-esteem. Their scores on the STAI-Trait scale are within the non-anxious range, and their self-esteem score is only slightly below the population mean. However, a notable exception is their interpersonal trust, which is significantly lower than the population average (Z-score of -1.42), suggesting potential difficulties in forming trusting relationships. Similarly, their self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53), and they perceive their stress levels to be moderately elevated compared to the population (Z-score of -0.71). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep, with a score slightly below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance, yet still indicative of issues.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pattern of limited physical activity. Their exercise frequency, whether alone or with others, is considerably lower than the population average, and they do not engage in sports. Substance use patterns are mixed, with reported absence of beer and recreational drug use, but notable consumption of wine or liquor three times a week or more, which is significantly higher than the population norm (Z-score of 1.68). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with lower engagement in more active hobbies like reading or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level.

Wearable data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a relatively high Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -0.33, which given its negative correlation with CES-D suggests this is a slightly positive sign, though the value itself is below average) and a low Intradaily Variability (Z-score of -0.95), suggesting a consistent daily pattern of activity and rest. The participant's Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population average, and their resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score of -0.62), which could indicate a good baseline cardiovascular fitness or potentially lower physiological arousal. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is slightly above average, and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), which is expected. Notably, there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation during late morning (9-10 AM) and late evening (9-10 PM), significantly exceeding population averages (Z-scores of -1.50 and 1.61 respectively). Conversely, there are also periods of significantly higher than average heart rate deviations during mid-afternoon (2-3 PM) and early evening (6-7 PM), indicating times of higher physiological arousal. Sleep duration is notably longer than the population average (Z-score of 1.39), suggesting a tendency towards longer sleep, though subjective sleep quality from PSQI indicates this sleep may not be restorative.

Regarding depressive symptom burden, the participant's profile presents a mixed picture. While they exhibit low anxiety, high self-esteem, and a generally stable circadian rhythm, several factors suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology. Their low interpersonal trust and slightly lower than average happiness, coupled with moderately perceived stress, are concerning indicators. The disturbed sleep quality, despite longer sleep duration, further contributes to a profile that could align with depressive symptoms. The correlation between subjective happiness and CES-D score is moderately negative (-0.46), meaning lower happiness is associated with higher CES-D scores. Similarly, lower trust is correlated with CES-D (-0.41), and higher perceived stress is correlated with CES-D (0.28). Although specific CES-D scores are not provided, these patterns, particularly the interplay of lower trust, perceived stress, and disturbed sleep, lean towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

Conversely, self-esteem scores are within the average range (Z-score = -0.17), and perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.65). The participant reports average happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and trust levels (Z-score = -0.78). Substance usage, particularly beer and wine/liquor, is more frequent than the average (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is infrequent. Exercise patterns indicate a dichotomy, with regular solitary exercise (Frequency = 'Three times a week or more', Z-score = 1.07) contrasting with a lack of exercising with others (Z-score = -1.58). Daily recreational habits show significant internet usage (Time = '3-4 hours', Z-score = 1.52) and moderate listening to music, while time spent watching TV/videos, playing video games, and reading are minimal or non-existent.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics provide further insight. The participant's circadian rhythm is characterized by a relatively stable interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.08) but a higher than average intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.60), suggesting a less consistent daily pattern of physiological activity. The mesor (resting heart rate average) is within the population norms (Z-score = -0.06), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is slightly lower than average (Z-score = -0.22). The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, is observed at 4:25 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: Z-score = -1.15; 3-4 AM: Z-score = -0.58) and elevated heart rates during late morning and evening periods (e.g., 8-9 AM: Z-score = 2.09; 5-6 PM: Z-score = 0.83). This pattern, particularly the pronounced dips during sleep and elevated activity during waking hours, might reflect typical diurnal variations, but the magnitude of deviations warrants attention. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below average (Z-score = -0.68), and a relatively consistent sleep start time with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score = 0.39).

Considering the comprehensive analysis of the participant's data, several factors suggest a potentially higher burden of depressive symptoms. The significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = 1.98) is a strong indicator often associated with elevated CES-D scores. While self-esteem is not critically low, the elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.76) and moderate perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.65) are contributing factors. The behavioral patterns, including frequent alcohol consumption and limited social engagement through exercise, alongside extensive internet usage, may also be indicative of coping mechanisms or reduced engagement in other activities. The below-average sleep duration and high intradaily variability in heart rate, while not definitively pathological, further contribute to a picture of potential disruption. The correlations provided, although not overriding the holistic analysis, show varying degrees of association with CES-D score. Notably, the positive correlation of STAI (0.81) and PSQI (though not provided, generally correlates positively) with CES-D, and negative correlations of Self-Esteem (-0.71) and Happiness (-0.46) are consistent with higher depressive symptomatology. Given the convergence of these indicators, it is plausible that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the upper half of the study population.

Conversely, interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Trust Z-score: 0.50) and shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D score (-0.41), implying that greater trust is linked to fewer depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53) with a negative correlation to CES-D score (-0.46), indicating that lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.70) with a negative correlation to CES-D score (-0.39), suggesting that lower health satisfaction is associated with more depressive symptoms. The participant reports generally low levels of substance usage, with the exception of wine or liquor consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). Daily recreational activities are limited, with a notable absence of watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading, and instead, considerable time is spent on internet usage and listening to music. Socializing with friends is also reported as not occurring frequently, which, alongside limited engagement in passive recreational activities, could be indicative of social withdrawal or reduced pleasure in common activities.

Wearable-derived metrics offer further insight into the participant's physiological and behavioral regularity. The participant's sleep duration is shorter than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.65), and the standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly above average, suggesting some variability in sleep timing. The median sleep start time is early in the morning (01:26:30), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is below average, indicating a relatively consistent, albeit late, sleep onset. Mean daily naps are significantly elevated (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 2.34), which could be compensatory for insufficient nighttime sleep or indicative of low energy. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable rhythm with an interdaily stability score of 0.4 (Z-score: -0.08) and an intradaily variability score of 0.83 (Z-score: 2.01), the latter being significantly elevated and suggesting marked fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, potentially indicative of dysregulated arousal patterns. The mesor (average heart rate) is within the population average (Mesor Z-score: 0.17), but the amplitude is moderately elevated (Amplitude Z-score: 0.52), suggesting greater peak-to-trough variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (4:46 PM). The resting heart rate is below average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.22). Analysis of hourly deviations from the mesor reveals consistently lower than average heart rates during the early morning hours (3 AM to 6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.12 to -0.69), potentially reflecting a period of deep sleep or low physiological arousal. Conversely, heart rate tends to be elevated in the evening and night, particularly between 6 PM and 10 PM (with Z-scores up to 1.16), which may indicate a delayed circadian phase or difficulties with sleep onset and maintenance, contributing to the observed short sleep duration. The elevated intradaily variability combined with this late-night arousal pattern may reflect difficulties in regulating physiological states throughout the day and night.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom 50% of the study population. While there are indicators that might suggest higher depressive symptoms, such as below-average self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, and elevated napping, these are counterbalanced by strong self-esteem and low trait anxiety, which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores. The observed sleep disturbances, particularly short duration and late onset, alongside elevated intradaily heart rate variability and evening/nighttime arousal, could be associated with depressive symptoms. However, the robust self-esteem and low anxiety may buffer against the full expression of depressive symptomatology. The moderate negative correlations of self-esteem, trust, and happiness with CES-D score suggest that improvements in these areas would likely lead to lower depressive symptoms. Given the strength of the self-esteem finding (Z-score 0.11, correlation -0.71), it appears to be a significant protective factor.

However, perceived stress is moderately elevated (Stress Z-score: 0.65), and health satisfaction is also high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.38). Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week, with higher than average frequency (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). Physical activity levels are also high, with frequent exercise both alone and with others (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07, Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23), although engagement in sports is infrequent (Sports Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits include minimal engagement in sedentary activities such as watching TV, video games, internet usage, and reading, with significant time spent listening to music and socializing with friends.

Wearable data reveals a resting heart rate slightly below the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.56). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates moderate stability in daily activity patterns (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.57) and higher than average variability within the day (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.81). The Mesor, representing the midpoint of the circadian rhythm, is lower than average (Mesor Z-score: -1.01), suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological activity. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also somewhat diminished (Amplitude Z-score: -0.63), implying less pronounced daily fluctuations in cardiovascular activity. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pattern of lower than average heart rates during the early morning and late evening hours, with higher than average rates during mid-morning and late afternoon. Specifically, the deviations are markedly negative between 1 AM and 6 AM, and again from 5 PM to 11 PM, with positive deviations primarily observed between 7 AM and 4 PM. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 33 minutes, which is below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.79), and a relatively stable sleep start time. The frequency of daily naps is slightly higher than average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.94).

The overall pattern suggests a participant who generally reports positive psychological states such as low anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness, coupled with a perception of good sleep quality and high health satisfaction. However, this is contrasted by elevated perceived stress and moderate substance usage. Physiologically, the data suggests a lower than average resting heart rate and a somewhat attenuated circadian rhythm amplitude, with increased intraday variability. The sleep duration is also shorter than average. The negative correlations between CES-D scores and self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction suggest that higher CES-D scores are associated with lower levels of these positive indicators. Conversely, positive correlations between CES-D and perceived stress indicate that elevated stress is associated with higher CES-D scores. Given the strong indicators of high self-esteem, happiness, and good sleep quality, which are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms, and considering the relatively low correlation of many other measures with CES-D, it is probable that this participant falls into the lower half of the distribution for depressive symptoms.

Wearable data reveals a generally stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by a relatively high interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.25) and low intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.59) in heart rate. The MESOR, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is above average (Z-score: 0.56). The amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm is also above average (Z-score: 0.47), suggesting a robust daily fluctuation. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (4:23 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.14). The aggregated hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate a pattern of lower heart rate during the late-night and early-morning hours, with pronounced negative deviations between 3-6 AM, suggestive of deep sleep or reduced physiological arousal. Heart rate begins to increase around 7-8 AM, peaking in the early afternoon between 1-3 PM, with the highest positive deviation observed between 2-3 PM. This pattern aligns with a typical diurnal rhythm, with post-lunch dips and recovery in the afternoon. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is above average (Z-score: 0.59), and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.82), suggesting consistent sleep timing. The median sleep start time is late, around midnight (23:56:28), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times. There is no reported napping behavior.

Considering the strong inverse correlations between self-esteem and CES-D scores (-0.71), coupled with positive self-regard and good subjective sleep quality, the available evidence leans towards a lower burden of depressive symptoms. While substance use is slightly elevated, and daily recreation habits lean towards being less passive, these are counterbalanced by robust physical activity and a stable circadian rhythm. The consistent sleep duration and above-average sleep duration further support a less disturbed sleep profile.

55424,35.0,0.9637305699481865,"This participant exhibits several notable behavioral and physiological patterns that may be associated with depressive symptomatology. Self-report data indicate high levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.55), which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is relatively low (RSES Z-score = -0.87), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting that lower self-worth may be linked to increased depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is also reported as low (Z-score = -1.61), exhibiting a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.45). Perceived stress, while not markedly elevated (Z-score = 0.38), shows a positive correlation (0.28). Notably, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = 3.37), a finding that aligns with the common association between poor sleep and depression. The participant's health satisfaction is moderate (Z-score = 0.38) with a negative correlation (-0.4). Substance usage, including beer and wine/liquor, is reported at a frequency of 1-2 times a month, with negligible correlations to CES-D. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is characterized by exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score = 1.23), a behavior with a slight negative correlation (-0.24). Sedentary habits include watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage for approximately 31 minutes an hour each, and listening to music for 15 minutes or less. Socializing with friends is also reported for approximately 31 minutes an hour. Notably, reading and video game usage are reported as ""Do not do,"" which have modest positive correlations with CES-D.

Wearable data reveals significant deviations in the participant's circadian rhythm and sleep patterns. The PSQI score, reflecting subjectively reported disturbed sleep, is substantially higher than the population mean (Z-score = 3.37). While Fitbit-derived sleep duration is within normal limits (median 7 hours 24 minutes, Z-score = 0.27), the standard deviation of sleep duration is notably low (69 minutes, Z-score = -0.72), suggesting a rigid sleep schedule. However, the median sleep start time is late (00:21:40), with a standard deviation of 58 minutes, indicating some variability in bedtime. The mean daily nap count is elevated (0.24, Z-score = 1.9), which can be a marker of fragmented sleep or fatigue. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data indicates moderate interdaily stability (0.42, Z-score = 0.09) and intradaily variability (0.48, Z-score = -0.46), suggesting a somewhat regular daily pattern. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly below the population mean (72.96, Z-score = -0.13), with a resting heart rate also slightly below average (57.6, Z-score = -0.07). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly elevated (11.82, Z-score = 0.34), and the acrophase occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM), indicating the peak of the heart rate cycle. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Significant negative deviations occur during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: -12.84, 2-3 AM: -19.62, 3-4 AM: -20.20, 4-5 AM: -20.94), suggesting a period of lower physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, notable positive deviations are observed during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 3-4 PM: 16.23, 4-5 PM: 16.71, 6-7 PM: 17.75, 7-8 PM: 19.78), indicating periods of higher physiological activity. However, there are also significant negative deviations in the late evening (e.g., 8-9 PM: 2.77, 10-11 PM: -2.05), and a sharp negative deviation from 11 PM to midnight (-10.07). The correlations of these hourly deviations with CES-D scores are generally weak, with a few minor negative correlations noted during the afternoon and evening hours.

Considering the confluence of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low self-reported happiness, and significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality, along with a tendency for less optimal daily physiological patterns as suggested by late sleep start times and elevated napping, the evidence points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While some behavioral aspects like exercise with others are positive, the dominant psychological and sleep-related metrics are concerning. The elevated PSQI score, in particular, is a strong indicator of potential depressive symptomatology.

23576,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The participant exhibits a number of notable behavioral and physiological patterns. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72) and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.96), alongside relatively high trust (Trust Z-score: 0.83) and health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.72). Happiness levels are also within a moderate range (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Perceived stress is relatively low (Stress Z-score: -0.17). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), though this z-score suggests it is only slightly worse than the population median. Substance usage is reported as minimal across all categories.

In terms of physical activity, the participant reports exercising alone frequently (""Three times a week or more"", Z-score: 1.07) and engaging in sports and exercising with others at a moderate frequency (""1-2 times a week"", Z-scores: 0.91 and 0.53 respectively). Daily recreation habits show a preference for sedentary activities, with substantial time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score: 1.71). Internet usage is moderate (Z-score: -0.49), while listening to music is infrequent (Z-score: -0.72). Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level (Z-score: 0.16). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or other sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals a consistent sleep schedule, with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score: 0.72), which is slightly longer than the population average. The standard deviation for sleep duration is low (58 minutes, Z-score: -0.98), suggesting high regularity in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is 00:38:08 with a low standard deviation (45 minutes, Z-score: -0.83), indicating a highly consistent sleep onset time. Mean daily naps are absent (Z-score: -0.86).

Circadian rhythm analysis shows moderate interdaily stability (0.47, Z-score: 0.5) and intradaily variability (0.58, Z-score: 0.24) in heart rate, suggesting a generally regular but not exceptionally rigid daily pattern. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.45, Z-score: 1.06) is high, indicating a strong day-to-day predictability in heart rate patterns. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population mean (71.37, Z-score: -0.35) and the amplitude of heart rate variation is also slightly below average (10.47, Z-score: -0.1). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is estimated at 4:05 PM. Resting heart rate is within the average range (57.6, Z-score: -0.07).

Analysis of the Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor reveals distinct hourly heart rate patterns. During nighttime and early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate is consistently below the mesor, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 2 AM and 6 AM, suggesting a period of reduced physiological arousal during this time. As the day progresses, heart rate tends to be around or above the mesor, with notable positive deviations observed in the late morning (9 AM - 11 AM) and afternoon (12 PM - 5 PM), peaking between 4 PM and 5 PM. Evening hours show a return to values near or slightly above the mesor, with some variability. The generally low negative correlations between these hourly deviations and CES-D scores suggest these specific hourly patterns do not strongly predict depressive symptoms.

Considering the provided data, the participant's CES-D score would likely fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution. While the PSQI indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" its z-score is only -0.33, suggesting it's not a significant outlier towards poor sleep. The self-reported measures generally lean towards positive psychological functioning, with low anxiety, high self-esteem, and moderate happiness. The sedentary recreational habits, particularly prolonged video game and TV viewing, and minimal reading are areas that could potentially be associated with higher depressive symptoms, however, their correlation with CES-D scores are largely negligible or slightly positive, which is contrary to what might be expected for indicators of depressive symptomatology. The consistent and healthy sleep duration and timing, along with a relatively stable and predictable circadian rhythm, are protective factors against elevated depressive symptoms. The lack of substance use and high academic performance (GPA) also suggest robust functioning. While certain aspects of daily habits might not be ideal for overall well-being, the prevailing indicators from psychological self-reports and consistent physiological rhythms point towards a CES-D score that is not exceptionally high.

93485,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics. Self-reported data indicate a relatively low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62) and a satisfactory level of self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.82, indicating higher than average self-esteem), although the interpretation of RSES scores ranges from 10-40, with higher scores indicating greater self-esteem, the provided score of 44.0 suggests a potential discrepancy or error in the data or interpretation provided for RSES. The participant also reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -0.8), with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 1 minute (Z-score: -0.2). Their interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.18), and self-reported happiness is near the average (Z-score: -0.53). Perceived stress is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.44), and health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score: 1.8).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above the study population average (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). They report no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity levels are higher than average, with frequent exercise alone (Three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07) but infrequent exercise with others. Sports participation is notably absent. Daily recreational habits include moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.18), significant time spent listening to music (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.21), and socializing with friends for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score: 0.16). They report minimal reading time (15 minutes or less) and do not engage in watching TV/videos/movies or video games.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is lower than the study average (Z-score: -1.29). Their circadian rhythm exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.0), suggesting a regular daily pattern, and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.46). The mesor (average heart rate across the 24-hour cycle) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.16). Notably, the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is significantly elevated (Z-score: 1.9), indicating a larger difference between peak and trough heart rates, with the acrophase occurring in the late afternoon. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significant deviations below the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), with Z-scores as low as -2.33. Conversely, there are pronounced positive deviations during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM - 2 PM), with Z-scores reaching 2.22. This suggests a typical diurnal fluctuation in cardiovascular activity with a pronounced dip in the early morning and a significant peak in the early afternoon.

The correlations provided offer additional context. A negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (-0.71) suggests that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, a negative correlation between health satisfaction and CES-D (-0.39) indicates that lower health satisfaction is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Trust also shows a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41). Conversely, perceived stress shows a positive correlation (0.28), implying higher stress is linked to higher depressive symptoms. These correlations, when considered alongside the individual's scores, suggest a pattern where lower self-esteem, health satisfaction, and trust, coupled with higher perceived stress, might contribute to a higher CES-D score. The participant's self-reported data on self-esteem (score 44.0, Z-score 0.82, with interpretation indicating higher scores mean greater self-esteem) presents a conflict. If the score of 44.0 is accurate within a 10-40 range, it suggests an error in the provided data or interpretation as it significantly exceeds the stated range. Assuming the Z-score of 0.82 is valid and indicative of higher than average self-esteem, this would generally be protective against depressive symptoms. However, the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score suggests that if this participant *were* to have lower self-esteem, it would be a significant contributor to depressive symptoms. The good subjective sleep quality, combined with a median sleep duration close to the population average, might be a mitigating factor. The elevated amplitude in heart rate variability, coupled with the distinct diurnal pattern, could reflect underlying physiological regulation that warrants further investigation in relation to mood states. The above-average substance use, particularly alcohol, and below-average social exercise frequency are behaviors that could potentially be associated with depressive symptoms, although their direct correlation with CES-D in this data is weak.

Considering the CES-D population statistics, the mean is 13.33, with a median of 11.5 and a 75th percentile of 18.0. The participant's self-reported metrics, while mixed, lean towards characteristics often associated with lower depressive symptomatology (low anxiety, high self-esteem, good subjective sleep). However, the strong negative correlations between self-esteem, health satisfaction, and trust with CES-D suggest that any deviations in these areas could significantly impact depressive symptom burden. Without a direct CES-D score, a definitive placement is challenging. Given the self-reported good mental health indicators (low anxiety, high self-esteem) and positive subjective sleep quality, these factors would generally suggest a CES-D score in the lower half of the distribution. However, the presence of moderate alcohol consumption, below-average social exercise, and the potential for these factors to negatively correlate with CES-D (even if not strongly shown here) cannot be entirely discounted. The notable amplitude in heart rate could suggest physiological stress or dysregulation, which might be indirectly linked to mood. If the self-reported self-esteem score of 44.0 is indeed accurate and within its intended range, this would strongly argue for a lower CES-D score. However, due to the potential data inconsistency regarding self-esteem, and without direct CES-D data, a precise determination is limited. Given the generally positive self-reported psychological indicators, the inclination is towards the lower half, but with a caveat regarding the potential influence of other factors and the self-esteem data ambiguity. However, based on the provided strong negative correlations of self-esteem, trust, and health satisfaction with CES-D, it is important to consider that if these traits were to be lower, the CES-D score would likely be higher. Since the participant reports high self-esteem and health satisfaction, this would suggest lower CES-D.

Notably, the participant reports low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31), indicating a generally calm disposition. This is contrasted by a high self-esteem score (Z-score: 1.24), suggesting a positive self-regard. However, the participant also reports a high level of interpersonal trust (Z-score: 1.47) and happiness (Z-score: 1.64), which are positively correlated with lower CES-D scores, suggesting that these traits may buffer against depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant reports high perceived stress (Z-score: -1.26), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores, potentially indicating a vulnerability. Subjectively, sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Z-score: -0.8), despite a relatively high median sleep duration (Z-score: 1.53), suggesting a potential discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep experience or that sleep duration is not the sole determinant of perceived quality.

Analysis of wearable data reveals a generally stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by a relatively low Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.45) and a moderate Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 0.98). The Mesor (Value: 78.2, Z-score: 0.58) suggests a typical average heart rate for this participant relative to the population. The Amplitude (Z-score: -1.01) is below average, potentially indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The observed hourly deviations from the Mesor indicate that heart rate is generally lower during early morning hours, peaking in the evening, with the acrophase occurring around 5:03 PM. Notably, the deviation from the Mesor is most pronounced and negative during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), suggesting a period of lower physiological arousal during these times, consistent with sleep. However, there is a noticeable increase in heart rate deviation in the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM, 9-10 PM), which warrants further investigation in relation to sleep patterns. While the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, the sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score: -0.51) and sleep start time standard deviation (Z-score: -0.28) are within average ranges, suggesting some variability but not extreme irregularity.

The participant's engagement in activities shows a mixed pattern. They engage in moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94) and exercise frequently, both alone (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07) and with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.53). They also participate in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.91). However, certain recreational activities are largely absent, such as video games and listening to music, and internet usage is reported as relatively low (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.16). Socializing with friends is also reported for a limited duration (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.62). The correlations between these behaviors and CES-D scores are generally weak, with the exception of perceived stress, which has a positive correlation (0.28), and self-esteem, which has a negative correlation (-0.71). The negative correlation with self-esteem is particularly noteworthy, as it aligns with the participant's high self-esteem score.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant exhibits a number of characteristics that are generally associated with lower depressive symptomatology, including low anxiety, high self-esteem, high interpersonal trust, and high reported happiness. These factors, coupled with a stable circadian rhythm and frequent engagement in physical activity, suggest a potentially resilient psychological profile. While perceived stress is elevated, its correlation with CES-D is moderate, and the strong positive self-regard may mitigate its impact. The sleep data, while showing good subjective quality, does not present clear red flags for significant disruption that would strongly indicate elevated depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the available data, the participant's CES-D score is likely to fall within the lower half of the study population distribution.

Self-reported anxiety (STAI) is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.07), while self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score = -0.17). Perceived stress levels are notably high (Z-score = 0.92), aligning with a less than ideal subjective health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.3). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is also identified as disturbed (Z-score = 0.59), with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above average for the study population (Z-score = 0.14). The standard deviation in sleep duration is within the average range (Z-score = -0.25), suggesting some variability but not extreme inconsistency. Interpersonal trust is higher than average (Z-score = 0.83), contrasting with moderate self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a high frequency of exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07), which is a positive health behavior. However, sedentary activities, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 0.64) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score = 1.41), occupy a significant portion of their time, exceeding the average for the population. Their internet usage and reading habits are also around the average. Notably, social interaction with friends occurs less frequently than the average (Z-score = -0.62). Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, and infrequent use of alcohol.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics indicate a relatively stable rhythm, as suggested by the interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.22). The intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z-score = 0.6), suggesting more fluctuation within the day. The mesor (average heart rate across the day) is low, indicating a lower than average resting heart rate (Mesor Z-score = -1.55, Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.93). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also lower than average (Z-score = -0.72), implying a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Analysis of hourly deviations from the mesor reveals significant patterns. There is a marked reduction in heart rate deviation during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), and a sharp increase in heart rate deviation during late afternoon and early evening hours (particularly 4-5 PM, Z-score = 2.76), indicating a potential peak in physiological arousal during this period. This is followed by a gradual decrease in heart rate deviation through the evening.

Considering the overall pattern of data, several factors suggest a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The elevated perceived stress, disturbed sleep quality, and lower than average self-reported happiness are all significant indicators. The high engagement in sedentary leisure activities and reduced social interaction with friends, coupled with a high frequency of exercising alone, might suggest withdrawal or a preference for solitary activities, which can be associated with depressive symptomatology. While the participant exhibits healthy behaviors like exercise and minimal substance use, the constellation of negative psychological indicators and lifestyle patterns, particularly the combination of high stress, poor sleep, and reduced social engagement, points towards a more challenging psychological state.

Based on the provided data, the participant's profile suggests a potentially elevated level of depressive symptoms. The Perceived Stress Scale score is high (Z-score 0.92), indicating significant appraisal of life situations as stressful. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score 0.59), which is strongly correlated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53). While self-esteem is only slightly below average (Z-score -0.17) and anxiety is near the population mean (Z-score 0.07), the confluence of high stress, poor sleep, and low happiness, alongside a notable reduction in social time with friends (Z-score -0.62), leans towards a higher depressive symptom burden. These indicators align more closely with the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

This is accompanied by significantly lower than average self-esteem, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 28.0, 1.43 standard deviations below the mean. Furthermore, interpersonal trust is markedly low, with a Z-score of -2.07, and self-reported happiness is also notably low, with a Z-score of -1.61. Perceived stress is above average, with a Z-score of 0.92. These psychological indicators suggest a disposition towards negative affect and lower levels of well-being.

Behaviorally, this participant reports moderate substance usage, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, aligning with the population average. Beer consumption is less frequent, at 1-2 times a month, and recreational or non-prescribed drug usage is reported as none. Exercise habits are robust, with the participant exercising alone and with others three times a week or more, and participating in sports 1-2 times a week. These frequencies are above the population average for exercising alone and with others. Daily recreational habits indicate a substantial amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour) and engaging with the internet (2-3 hours). Listening to music is also a significant activity (2-3 hours). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, which is around the population average. Notably, this participant reports not engaging in video games or reading for leisure.

From a physiological perspective derived from wearable data, the participant demonstrates a less regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are both significantly below average, with Z-scores of -1.48 and -1.54 respectively, suggesting a disrupted pattern of daily activity and physiological functioning. Intradaily variability is also slightly below average. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the day, is slightly above average. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average, indicating a reduced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is recorded at 4:28 PM, which is a typical time. Resting heart rate is within the average range. Analysis of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals pronounced dips in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (2-6 AM), with significant negative deviations. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate during the morning waking hours (6-9 AM) and early evening (6-7 PM).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, which is slightly below average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is higher than average, suggesting variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is around 1:04 AM, which is later than average, and the variability in sleep start time is also elevated. Napping behavior is minimal. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 suggests a degree of disturbed sleep, which is classified as 'Disturbed Sleep' and is marginally above average (Z-score of 0.13). This aligns with the subjective reports and potentially with objective sleep duration and timing variability.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant exhibits several indicators that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. High anxiety (STAI Z-score of 1.35), low self-esteem (Z-score of -1.43), low trust (Z-score of -2.07), and low happiness (Z-score of -1.61) are all strongly correlated with negative affect and are significant risk factors for depression. Perceived stress is also elevated. While the participant engages in frequent exercise, which is protective, the subjective reports of sleep disturbance, later and more variable sleep timing, and slightly reduced sleep duration, coupled with less stable circadian rhythms, are also suggestive of poorer mental health. The correlations provided further guide this assessment. For example, the strong positive correlation between STAI-Trait score and CES-D (0.81) and the strong negative correlation between Self-Esteem and CES-D (-0.71) are particularly noteworthy. Low happiness also has a notable negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). While the Fitbit data provides objective measures, the interpretation of these metrics in relation to depression can be complex. However, the reduced circadian rhythm stability (low interdaily stability and autocorrelation) and altered heart rate variability patterns can be associated with mood disorders. Given the constellation of psychological distress indicators, particularly high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and low trust, alongside disrupted sleep patterns and circadian rhythmicity, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the higher range of the study population distribution. The negative correlations of key self-report measures of well-being with the CES-D score further support this conclusion.

From wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest robust regularity. Interdaily stability (Z-score: 2.4) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 2.24) are notably high, indicating a consistent daily pattern. Conversely, intradaily variability (Z-score: -2.29) is low, suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor (mean heart rate level) is elevated relative to the population (Z-score: 1.35), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also higher than average (Z-score: 1.72), suggesting a larger daily range in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:51 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.51). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, with deviations as low as -26%. Heart rate then gradually increases throughout the morning, peaking in the late afternoon and evening before declining again overnight. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 14 minutes, which is very close to the population median (Z-score: 0.06). However, the variability in sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score: -1.48), suggesting more consistent nightly sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is around 1:04 AM, with moderate variability. Napping is infrequent.

The participant's CES-D score would likely fall in the bottom 50% of the study population. This assessment is supported by several factors: the participant reports very low levels of anxiety and stress, high self-esteem and happiness, and good subjective sleep quality. While the participant exhibits sedentary behaviors and extensive screen time, these are not strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores in the provided data. The wearable data indicates a highly regular circadian rhythm, which is generally associated with better mental well-being, and sleep duration is within the average range. The low perceived stress, high self-esteem, and low anxiety are strong indicators of lower depressive symptomatology.

69057,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"This participant presents a complex profile of self-reported traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics. Self-report data indicates elevated levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.16) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 1.19), which correlate positively with depressive symptoms (STAI Score Correlation = 0.82, PSS Score Correlation = 0.28). Conversely, the participant reports lower than average self-esteem (RSES Z-score = -0.45) and lower than average happiness (Happy Z-score = -0.53), both of which are negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is also reported as notably low (Trust Z-score = -1.42), with a moderate negative correlation with depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -0.78). The participant reports average or slightly elevated levels of substance usage for beer and wine/liquor, and higher than average usage of recreational drugs. Physical activity levels include exercising alone three times a week or more, which is above average, but exercising with others and engaging in sports are less frequent. Sedentary leisure activities such as watching TV and internet usage are within the average range, while listening to music is more frequent than average.

Wearable data reveals a significantly lower than average Mesor (mean heart rate adjusted for circadian rhythm, Z-score = -2.19) and resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.73), alongside a lower than average amplitude of heart rate variation (Z-score = -0.68). These findings suggest a generally subdued physiological arousal baseline. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates low interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.74), suggesting a less regular daily pattern in heart rate, and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.39). The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, is reported as 5:40 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor shows the most pronounced positive deviations occurring between 5 PM and 6 PM (Z-score = 1.79) and 7 PM and 8 PM (Z-score = 0.80), indicating periods of higher cardiovascular activity during the late afternoon and early evening. Conversely, significant negative deviations, suggesting lower than average heart rate, are observed during early morning hours, particularly between 5 AM and 6 AM (Z-score = -0.60).

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a significantly shorter than average median sleep duration (5 hours 35 minutes, Z-score = -1.99) and a later than average median sleep start time (02:08:15). The standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly higher than average, suggesting variability in sleep length. The standard deviation of sleep start time is lower than average, indicating more consistent bedtimes despite being late. The participant engages in very infrequent napping. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, aligning with the objectively measured short sleep duration.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant exhibits several indicators potentially associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The elevated levels of anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, strongly suggest psychological distress. The significantly reduced sleep duration, late sleep onset, and disturbed sleep quality as measured by the PSQI are also critical factors that often co-occur with depression. While the lower than average Mesor and resting heart rate might indicate a lower physiological arousal, this could also be a manifestation of anhedonia or fatigue, which are common in depressive states. The low interpersonal trust and lower than average health satisfaction further contribute to a picture of psychological discomfort. The negative correlations between self-esteem, happiness, and trust with the CES-D score suggest that improvements in these areas would likely correspond to lower depressive symptoms. Given the convergence of these factors – heightened anxiety and stress, reduced positive affect and self-worth, sleep disturbances, and lower interpersonal trust – it is likely that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden places them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

64232,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"The participant presents with several indicators that suggest elevated depressive symptomatology. Self-reported anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, are notably high (Z-score = 0.27), with a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, indicating that higher anxiety is associated with greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score = -0.17), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, suggesting that lower self-esteem is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is significantly elevated (Z-score = 1.47), correlating positively (0.28) with CES-D, implying that higher perceived stress is associated with more depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is also disturbed (Z-score = 0.59), with a positive correlation to CES-D, suggesting that poorer subjective sleep quality is linked to higher CES-D scores. While happiness is reported as somewhat low (Z-score = -0.53), its correlation with CES-D is moderate and negative (-0.46), indicating lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is average (Z-score = -0.03) with a weak negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D.

Behavioral patterns exhibit some concerning trends. Substance usage, particularly beer and wine or liquor, is higher than the population average (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), though correlations with CES-D are negligible. Recreational drug use is significantly elevated (Z-score = 3.52), but its correlation with CES-D is weak and positive (0.16). Exercise frequency, specifically in sports, is significantly above average (Z-score = 1.58), with a negative correlation (-0.15) to CES-D, suggesting that more frequent participation in sports is associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, sedentary behaviors such as watching TV/videos/movies and reading are not engaged in at all, while video game usage is also absent. Internet usage and listening to music are at moderate levels. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, with a near-zero correlation to CES-D.

Wearable data reveal disruptions in circadian rhythmicity and sleep patterns. Interdaily stability, a measure of daily routine regularity, is significantly low (Z-score = -1.56) with no correlation to CES-D. Intradaily variability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are also below population average, suggesting a less consistent daily physiological rhythm. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.46) with a weak positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D. The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, is late afternoon (4:57 PM). Resting heart rate is within the average range (Z-score = 0.15). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during late morning and evening hours, contrasting with significantly reduced heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM). Specifically, the deviation from the mesor is notably depressed between 1 AM and 6 AM, with the largest negative deviations observed between 2-3 AM (-16.79) and 3-4 AM (-19.08). Conversely, positive deviations are observed in the late afternoon and evening, peaking between 9-10 PM (13.21). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours, which is longer than the population average (Z-score = 1.01), but with a higher standard deviation, suggesting variability in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late (00:40:51), with a substantially high standard deviation (Z-score = 1.48), indicating significant irregularity in sleep timing. There are no recorded daily naps.

Considering the combination of elevated anxiety, high perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep quality, and significant irregularity in sleep timing and circadian rhythmicity, alongside moderate self-esteem and happiness, the participant's profile strongly suggests a high burden of depressive symptoms. The low interdaily stability in wearable data further supports a pattern of disrupted daily functioning. While engagement in sports is a positive indicator, the other multifactorial indicators point towards a more significant depressive symptom profile. The CES-D population mean is 13.31, with a median of 11.0 and a 75th percentile of 18.0. The combination of high anxiety (0.81 correlation with CES-D), high perceived stress (0.28 correlation with CES-D), and poor subjective sleep quality (positive correlation with CES-D) are significant indicators for elevated CES-D scores. The irregular sleep schedule and low interdaily stability also align with features often seen in individuals experiencing higher levels of depressive symptoms. Therefore, the totality of the evidence points towards the participant's CES-D score being in the upper half of the distribution.

37404,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"This participant presents a complex profile with several notable behavioral and physiological characteristics that warrant detailed examination in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-reported data indicate generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62) and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.03), which are typically inversely related to depressive symptoms. Similarly, self-reported happiness is also relatively low (Happy Z-score: -0.53), and health satisfaction is moderate (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.13). Perceived stress is also within a moderate range (Stress Z-score: -0.17). Interpersonal trust is somewhat lower than average (Trust Z-score: -0.46).

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor usage: 1-2 times a week) but infrequent substance use otherwise. Exercise habits are notably high, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07). However, other forms of exercise and sports engagement are less frequent. Daily recreational habits reveal a preference for passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies for short durations, and limited time spent on video games, internet usage, and listening to music. Socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies are reported as minimal or non-existent.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal some interesting patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.32). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.56) and high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.37) in heart rate, suggesting a less regular daily rhythm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also low (Amplitude Z-score: -1.54), indicating a reduced range of diurnal heart rate variation. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:32 PM). Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a consistent pattern of reduced heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from 0.36 to 0.71, indicating values lower than the mesor, and more pronounced negative deviations like -15.84 at 5-6 AM), followed by an increase throughout the morning and afternoon, peaking in the evening. This pattern of reduced heart rate during early morning hours and less pronounced diurnal fluctuations might suggest a disruption in the natural sleep-wake cycle.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 9 minutes, which is close to average, with a slightly lower than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.78), suggesting relative consistency. However, the median sleep start time is close to 1 AM, with a moderate standard deviation. The participant also reports disturbed sleep quality according to the PSQI (PSQI Z-score: 0.13), which is a potential indicator of sleep issues, often co-occurring with depressive symptoms. The absence of daily naps is also noted.

Considering the available data, the participant's relatively low self-reported anxiety and high self-esteem are protective factors against high depressive symptomatology. However, the high frequency of exercising alone, coupled with limited engagement in other social or recreational activities, might suggest a degree of social withdrawal or isolation, which can be associated with depression. The disturbed sleep quality, low interdaily stability, and high intradaily variability in heart rate, alongside the relatively late sleep start time, point towards potential disruptions in circadian rhythmicity and sleep patterns, which are common correlates of depression. While the correlation data for most individual metrics show weak relationships with the CES-D score, the combination of disrupted circadian rhythms, poorer sleep quality, and potentially limited social engagement suggests a profile that leans towards the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

These findings suggest a subjective experience characterized by heightened worry and a negative self-perception, which are commonly associated with depressive states. The participant also reports consuming alcohol (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01) and engages in higher levels of internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.67). Notably, sedentary hobbies are reported for 1-2 hours (Z-score: 1.41), indicating a potential tendency towards passive or less active leisure pursuits. Socializing with friends, while reported for 2-3 hours (Z-score: 0.95), has a negligible correlation with CES-D scores.

Wearable data provide insights into the participant's physiological and sleep patterns. The Mesor of the heart rate rhythm is below average (Z-score: -0.6), and the amplitude is also lower than the population mean (Z-score: -0.44), suggesting a dampened overall cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-score: -0.54). The circadian rhythm metrics reveal moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.17) and relatively low intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.04), implying a somewhat regular daily structure in heart rate, though not particularly robust. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration close to the population average (Z-score: -0.13), but a significantly higher standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: 2.75, correlation with CES-D: 0.2), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is notably late (03:03:40), with a substantial standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score: 1.21, correlation with CES-D: 0.22), further pointing to irregular sleep-wake cycles. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows pronounced dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: 1.02, 4-5 AM Z-score: 1.18, 5-6 AM Z-score: 0.68), indicating a significant drop in physiological arousal during this period. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate during midday and early afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM Z-score: 0.91, 1-2 PM Z-score: 0.66, 2-3 PM Z-score: 0.89, 3-4 PM Z-score: 0.66), suggesting a peak in activity or stress response during these times, which might be associated with academic demands.

Considering the aggregated evidence, the participant presents with a profile suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. The combination of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and perceived stress, alongside significant sleep irregularities (high variability in duration and start time) and a generally lower resting heart rate with pronounced dips in early morning arousal, are all indicators often associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While some behavioral habits like higher internet and music listening align with passive leisure, the substantial sleep disruption and negative self-perceptions are particularly salient. The positive correlations between anxiety, stress, and CES-D, and the negative correlation with self-esteem, further support this direction.

95543,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"This participant exhibits several characteristics that may be relevant to the evaluation of depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures indicate relatively low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.81) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = -1.72), suggesting a potentially lower burden of these specific symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (Z-Score = 1.52), which typically correlates negatively with depressive symptoms. However, the participant also reports higher than average happiness (Z-Score = 1.64), which, if interpreted in contrast to other findings, could suggest that other areas of functioning might be impacted or that the higher happiness is a protective factor against higher CES-D scores. Perceived stress is reported at a moderate level (Z-score = -0.98), and trust in others is slightly above average (Z-Score = 0.5). Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score = 1.3), indicating a positive outlook on physical well-being. Regarding daily habits, substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is a healthy indicator. Exercise frequency, specifically ""Exercised with Others,"" is reported as ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score = 1.23), suggesting engagement in social physical activity. Conversely, ""Exercised Alone"" is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-Score = -1.93), indicating a lack of solitary physical activity. Daily recreational habits reveal significant engagement in screen-based activities, with ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and ""Video Games"" showing higher than average time expenditure (Z-scores of 1.28 and 1.71 respectively). Internet usage is also slightly above average. Engagement in more traditionally restorative activities like ""Reading"" and ""Listening to Music"" are reported at lower than average frequencies or not at all.

Wearable data provides insights into physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. The participant exhibits relatively stable daily activity patterns, as indicated by a moderate Interdaily Stability (Value = 0.54, Z-Score = 1.08) and near-average Intradaily Variability (Value = 0.53, Z-Score = -0.11). The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value = 0.51, Z-Score = 1.57) suggests a reasonable degree of regularity in daily rhythms. The Mesor (Value = 82.9, Z-Score = 1.22), representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is elevated compared to the study population, and the Amplitude (Value = 13.2, Z-Score = 0.78) is also above average, indicating a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs around 6:35 PM. The Resting Heart Rate is also elevated (Value = 66.7, Z-Score = 1.02). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern: heart rates are significantly lower during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-7 AM, with deviations as low as -20.5 at 6-7 AM), suggesting a period of physiological rest. Heart rates then gradually increase, reaching their highest deviations from the Mesor in the late evening, particularly between 7 PM and 10 PM (with peaks of 20.17 at 7-8 PM and 21.48 at 8-9 PM). This pattern of lower nocturnal heart rates followed by a pronounced evening elevation may reflect a typical diurnal cardiovascular rhythm, though the elevated evening activity could be indicative of factors affecting arousal or stress during this period. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes, which is slightly above average (Z-Score = 0.29), and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Standard Deviation = 34 minutes, Z-Score = -1.08), suggesting good sleep regularity. There were no reported naps.

Considering the overall pattern of the data, the participant presents with several indicators often associated with lower depressive symptomatology, including high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, low anxiety, and moderate perceived stress. The high reported happiness is also a positive sign. While there is a strong preference for sedentary screen-based recreational activities over more passive or solitary ones, and a lack of solitary exercise, the presence of social exercise is positive. The elevated resting heart rate andMesorend evening heart rate peaks warrant attention but are not definitively indicative of high depressive symptoms in isolation. The regular sleep patterns and adequate sleep duration are also favorable. The positive correlations with higher CES-D scores are noted for increased perceived stress (0.28), and less strongly for internet usage (0.25) and listening to music (0.25). Conversely, negative correlations with higher CES-D scores are observed for higher self-esteem (-0.71), higher happiness (-0.46), higher trust (-0.41), and higher health satisfaction (-0.39), all of which are favorable. Given the strong protective indicators like high self-esteem and happiness, and the absence of other strong indicators of distress, it is likely that this participant's CES-D score falls in the lower half of the distribution.

Self-report measures indicate a generally low level of anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.22) and a high level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = 1.1), suggesting a resilient psychological disposition in these domains. This is further supported by high self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score = 1.64) and a relatively high GPA (average 3.91), indicative of academic success and positive affect. Conversely, the participant reports a lower-than-average degree of trust in others (Trust Z-score = 0.83), which could suggest a degree of interpersonal wariness. Perceived stress levels are moderate (Stress Z-score = -0.98), below the population average, and health satisfaction is notably high (Health Satisfaction Z-score = 1.47).

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports very low engagement in substance use and physical activities, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports, with Z-scores generally below -1.0, indicating significantly less activity than the average participant. Daily recreational habits also lean towards lower engagement, with minimal time spent on watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, all exhibiting Z-scores below -0.56, except for reading and sedentary hobbies which are closer to the population average. This pattern of low engagement in both physical and social activities could be a significant area for further exploration.

Wearable data reveals notable patterns in sleep and circadian rhythm. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is below the average for the study population (Z-score = -0.51), and the sleep start time is late, with a median of 01:28:59. The variability in both sleep duration and start time is close to the population average. Circadian rhythm analysis shows high interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 1.9) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score = 2.07), suggesting a regular daily pattern in heart rate. However, the intradaily variability is below average (Intradaily Variability Z-score = -0.53), indicating less fluctuation within the day. The mesor (average heart rate level) is close to the population average, with a slightly lower resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.22). The hourly deviations from the mesor indicate a pattern of significantly lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1 AM to 6 AM, with Z-scores as low as -1.04 and -1.0), followed by a gradual increase and then consistently higher-than-average heart rates in the early evening (e.g., 6 PM to 10 PM, with Z-scores up to 1.21). This suggests a robust physiological pattern, with a strong dip during presumed sleep/rest periods and elevated activity during the evening hours.

Overall, the participant presents with high self-esteem, low anxiety, and good academic performance, suggesting a positive psychological baseline. However, a notable trend is the very low engagement in physical activities and socializing, and a shorter, later sleep duration. The observed physiological patterns, particularly the pronounced dip in heart rate during the night and elevated heart rate in the evening, alongside high circadian stability, suggest a consistent, albeit perhaps somewhat inverted, daily rhythm. While the participant reports high happiness and low perceived stress, the limited engagement in social and physical activities, coupled with shorter sleep, warrants careful consideration in the context of overall well-being. The negative correlation between Self-Esteem and CES-D (r=-0.71), Happiness and CES-D (r=-0.46), and Trust and CES-D (r=-0.41) all suggest that higher scores in these areas are associated with lower depressive symptoms. The positive correlation between Stress and CES-D (r=0.28) suggests higher perceived stress is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Given the high self-esteem, happiness, and low stress, these factors would lean towards a lower CES-D score. The low engagement in activities, however, could be a marker for potential risk, but without a direct strong correlation with CES-D, its influence is less clear. The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep, which is a known correlate of depressive symptoms.

Considering the data holistically, the strong indicators of positive psychological well-being (high self-esteem, happiness, low anxiety and stress) appear to outweigh the potential risks suggested by low activity levels and disturbed sleep. The significant negative correlations of key positive self-report measures with CES-D strongly suggest a lower symptom burden.

Self-report data indicate heightened levels of chronic anxiety, with a STAI-Trait score of 58.0 (Z-score 1.65), suggesting a proneness to experiencing anxiety. This is coupled with lower-than-average self-esteem, indicated by a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 29.0 (Z-score -1.29), and a subdued sense of interpersonal trust (Score 2.67, Z-score -1.1). While self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), this is juxtaposed with a moderately elevated perceived stress level (Score 23.0, Z-score 0.38). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is within the ""Good Sleep"" classification (Score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), although this score is at the upper boundary for good sleep and warrants attention in conjunction with objective sleep metrics.

Objective sleep data from wearable devices indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes (Z-score -0.59), which is below the population average, and a greater variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation 67 minutes, Z-score -0.76), suggesting some inconsistency in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is approximately 00:51:15, with relatively low variability in sleep start time (Standard Deviation 84 minutes, Z-score 0.02), indicating a more consistent, albeit late, sleep onset. Napping behavior is notably absent (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86). Analysis of heart rate data reveals a circadian rhythm characterized by a MESOR of 70.01 bpm (Z-score -0.54) and an Amplitude of 9.31 bpm (Z-score -0.48), both suggesting a slightly blunted cardiovascular rhythm compared to the population. The Acrophase occurs around 4:23 PM, indicating the peak in heart rate activity. The participant's resting heart rate is 54.6 bpm (Z-score -0.42), which is below the population average.

Behavioral patterns reveal moderate engagement in exercise, with a frequency of 1-2 times a week for exercising alone and with others, and no participation in sports. Substance usage is minimal, with infrequent consumption of beer and wine/liquor, and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational activities show a mixed pattern. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are within average ranges. However, listening to music is limited to 15 minutes or less, and time spent socializing with friends is relatively short (31 minutes to an hour). Notably, activities such as video games and reading are not engaged in at all. Sedentary hobbies occupy a moderate amount of time (31 minutes to an hour). The intraday variability of heart rate is notably high (Value 0.7, Z-score 1.09), and the interdaily stability is low (Value 0.28, Z-score -1.07), suggesting a less structured and potentially more erratic daily physiological rhythm. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value 0.17, Z-score -1.29), further indicating a disruption in the consistency of daily physiological patterns.

Considering the overall distribution of CES-D scores, with a median of 11.0 and a 75th percentile of 18.0, this participant's profile suggests a CES-D score that may fall within the top 50th percentile. This is supported by the elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem and trust, and increased perceived stress, all of which are correlated with CES-D scores. Although objective sleep duration is slightly below average, subjective sleep quality is rated as good, which may temper the impact of sleep on CES-D scores. The limited social interaction and absence of engaging hobbies like reading and video games, coupled with high physiological variability and low stability, also point towards a potential for elevated depressive symptoms. While correlations are not definitive, the presence of negative correlations between self-esteem, trust, and health satisfaction with CES-D scores suggests that lower scores in these domains, as observed in this participant, would contribute to higher CES-D scores.

Similarly, the participant reports high happiness (Z-score of 1.64), which is a strong indicator of positive affect and typically inversely related to depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is within the average range for the population (PSS Z-score of -0.98), and interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Trust Z-score of -0.46). Health satisfaction is above average (Z-score of 1.22), which may suggest a generally positive outlook regarding well-being, though this is not a direct measure of depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral habits reveal a pattern of moderate substance usage, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.94) and beer 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.3), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency is notable, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), aligning with healthier behavioral patterns. However, engagement in sports and exercising with others is less frequent. Daily recreation habits indicate limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and low internet usage. Notably, listening to music is infrequent (15 minutes or less), but reading occurs for 16-30 minutes, and socializing with friends is substantial at 2-3 hours, which is a positive indicator.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data provide further insights. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score -1.08), which could reflect a good level of cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Z-score -0.08) and intradaily variability (Z-score -0.18), are largely within the population's norm, suggesting a relatively regular daily physiological rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle) is slightly below average (Z-score -0.35), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is near the population average (Z-score 0.09). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:17 PM), which is within a typical range.

Sleep statistics indicate a shorter than average median sleep duration (6 hours 17 minutes, Z-score -1.11) and a later than average median sleep start time (00:48:38). The variability in sleep start time is also higher than average (Z-score 0.66). While short sleep duration and inconsistent sleep timing can be associated with depressive symptoms, the PSQI score of 6.0 suggests subjectively disturbed sleep, though it is not markedly elevated compared to the population average for a clinically significant threshold. The mean number of daily naps is very low.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the early morning hours (2-5 AM), with values ranging from -27.48% to -20.51%. This suggests periods of physiological inactivity or lower arousal during these times, which is expected during sleep but the magnitude of deviation warrants consideration. During waking hours, deviations from the mesor are generally positive during the afternoon and evening (e.g., 4-5 PM and 6-8 PM), indicating periods of higher cardiovascular activity, and less pronounced during the morning and early afternoon.

Correlations provided with individual metrics offer guidance but should be interpreted in the context of the overall pattern. For example, the strong positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81) is notable, but the participant's low STAI score mitigates its impact. Similarly, the negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D (-0.71) and happiness and CES-D (-0.46) suggests these are likely to be protective factors. The positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D (0.28) is moderate, but the participant's average stress levels do not strongly suggest an elevated CES-D score. Sleep duration shows a near-zero correlation with CES-D (-0.01), and sleep start time a near-zero correlation (0.22), indicating these specific sleep metrics may not be strongly predictive of CES-D in this participant.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant presents with a profile characterized by low anxiety, high self-esteem, and high self-reported happiness, all of which are robust indicators of lower depressive symptomatology. While sleep duration is below average and sleep timing is somewhat irregular, these factors do not appear to be strongly correlated with CES-D for this individual, and the PSQI score is only mildly elevated. Behavioral patterns, including regular exercise and significant social engagement, further support a profile less indicative of elevated depressive symptoms. The physiological data does not reveal extreme deviations that would strongly suggest a depressive state.

35987,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"This participant presents with a complex profile of self-reported traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics. Notably, the individual reports elevated levels of anxiety, as indicated by a high STAI score (Z=0.96), and poorer subjective sleep quality, evidenced by a PSQI score indicative of disturbed sleep (Z=0.59). Conversely, self-esteem is below average (Z=-1.43), and health satisfaction is also lower than the study population (Z=-0.95). The participant reports moderate internet usage and listening to music, with lower-than-average engagement in exercise and socializing with friends. Substance use, specifically beer, is reported at a higher-than-average frequency (Z=1.01), while wine/liquor and recreational drugs are not used.

The wearable data reveals a disrupted circadian rhythm. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated compared to the population (Z=0.56), and the Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also significantly higher (Z=1.16), suggesting greater daily fluctuations in cardiovascular activity. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm is reported at 7:04 PM, indicating a later peak in heart rate. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z=1.74), suggesting a regular daily pattern in terms of heart rate variability, however, this is coupled with a high intradaily variability (Z=0.81), indicating significant fluctuations within the day. There are pronounced deviations from the mean heart rate during the early morning hours (4-6 AM), with values significantly below the mesor (e.g., 5-6 AM: Z=-1.3 and -0.92 respectively), which is atypical and may reflect periods of very low physiological arousal. Conversely, there are notable peaks in heart rate deviation during the evening and late night hours (6-10 PM), particularly between 9-10 PM (Z=2.27), suggesting periods of heightened physiological activity during these times. Sleep duration is below average (Z=-0.81), and the standard deviation of sleep duration is also lower than average (Z=-1.02), suggesting shorter and perhaps more consistent sleep episodes. The median sleep start time is notably late (around 2:45 AM), with a standard deviation suggesting variability in sleep onset. The participant also reports no naps.

The analysis of the provided data suggests a moderate to high burden of depressive symptoms. The elevated anxiety (STAI Z=0.96) and poorer sleep quality (PSQI Z=0.59) are common correlates of depression. The low self-esteem (Z=-1.43) and lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.95) further support this. The observed circadian rhythm disruptions, particularly the late sleep start time, potential sleep fragmentation indicated by high intradaily variability, and pronounced deviations in heart rate during the night, are also strongly associated with depressive symptomatology. While the interdaily stability is high, the overall pattern suggests a dysregulated internal clock and potentially reduced daytime functioning. The positive correlation between STAI score and CES-D score (0.82) is particularly strong, indicating that higher anxiety levels are strongly associated with higher CES-D scores in this study population. The negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (-0.71) also suggests that lower self-esteem is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Although not all correlations are explicitly provided for every metric, the combination of these self-reported psychological states and the physiological markers of disrupted sleep and circadian rhythmicity points towards a significant level of depressive symptoms. Considering the population's mean CES-D score of 13.32 and standard deviation of 9.62, the participant's profile, marked by heightened anxiety, low self-esteem, and sleep/circadian disturbances, is likely to place them above the median.

79341,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral traits that warrant careful consideration in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-reported measures indicate moderate levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.03) and self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.11), suggesting these are not significant drivers of elevated depressive symptoms. Similarly, interpersonal trust is at a near-average level (Trust Z-score: -0.46). Of note, self-reported happiness is notably low (Happy Z-score: -1.61), which is a significant indicator potentially linked to depressive states, and it correlates negatively with CES-D scores. Perceived stress levels are also considerably high (Stress Z-score: -1.8), showing a positive correlation with CES-D scores, suggesting that higher perceived stress may contribute to increased depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.28), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as not at all, with Z-scores all below -0.11, indicating minimal to no usage. Exercise habits are robust, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07) and engaging in sports or exercising with others 1-2 times a week, all of which show a weak negative correlation with CES-D. Daily recreational habits include substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and listening to music, all with positive Z-scores. Conversely, internet usage, reading, and sedentary hobbies are engaged in less frequently.

Analysis of wearable-derived data reveals significant deviations in sleep patterns and circadian rhythm regularity. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is below average for the population (Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.51) and exhibits a slight negative correlation with CES-D. The median sleep start time is around 1:50 AM, with a standard deviation suggesting some variability but not extreme irregularity. The participant's resting heart rate is notably low (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.18), as is the overall Mesor (Mesor Z-score: -1.32), indicating a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. Circadian rhythm metrics show a relatively stable daily pattern as indicated by high interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.91) and moderate intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.59). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also high (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 0.98), suggesting a consistent daily rhythm. However, the hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late night and early morning hours. Notably, heart rate is substantially lower than the mesor between 3-4 AM (Deviation Z-score: -0.76) and 4-5 AM (Deviation Z-score: -1.11), indicating a period of deep physiological rest or potentially suppressed activity. Conversely, heart rate is considerably elevated above the mesor during midday, particularly between 12-1 PM (Deviation Z-score: 1.87) and 1-2 PM (Deviation Z-score: 1.27), suggesting a period of higher physiological activity or arousal. These midday peaks in heart rate deviation from the mesor, coupled with low resting heart rate and Mesor, might reflect a pattern of intense but potentially non-sustained physiological engagement.

Considering the available data, the participant's profile suggests a moderate burden of depressive symptoms. The significantly low self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: -1.61) and high perceived stress (Stress Z-score: -1.8) are strong indicators suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology, both of which correlate with CES-D scores. While self-esteem and trait anxiety are near average, the low happiness and high stress are more directly aligned with the manifestation of depressive symptoms. The sleep duration being slightly below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.51) also contributes to a picture of potentially suboptimal well-being. The physiological data, while showing a generally regular circadian rhythm, does present a picture of marked physiological shifts between deep rest in the early morning and significant arousal during midday, which could be indicative of a dysregulated daily energy pattern. Given the strong indicators of low happiness and high perceived stress, and the slightly reduced sleep duration, it is plausible that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution, indicating a more pronounced level of depressive symptomatology.

Self-reported measures suggest a generally low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.51), indicating a stable predisposition towards calmness. Concurrently, self-esteem appears to be in the average range for the study population (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.4), with a notable negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Happiness levels are significantly elevated compared to the study population (Happy Z-score: 1.64), and this positive affect also shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.46). Perceived stress is within the average range (Stress Z-score: -0.17) with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. Health satisfaction is notably high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.3), indicating a positive outlook on physical well-being, which also correlates negatively with CES-D.

Behavioral habits reveal moderate levels of social engagement (Socializing with Friends Time: 2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95) and substantial engagement in listening to music (Listening to Music Time: more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06). Exercise frequency is in the moderate range for solo and group exercise (1-2 times a week) but notably low for sports (Not at all, Z-score: -1.09). Substance usage is generally low to moderate, with a notable absence of recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Sedentary activities such as watching TV and video games are minimal. Notably, sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is within a range that suggests some disturbance (PSQI Score: 6.0, Z-score: -0.33), and this metric has a positive correlation with CES-D scores, indicating that poorer subjective sleep quality is associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data present a mixed picture. The participant's overall activity rhythm exhibits moderate stability and variability (Interdaily Stability: 0.41, Z-score: 0.0; Intradaily Variability: 0.65, Z-score: 0.74). The mesor (average heart rate) is close to the population average (Mesor Z-score: 0.04). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a general pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM: -20.41, 5-6 AM: -22.99, 6-7 AM: -23.37). Conversely, there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation during the day, particularly in the afternoon and evening (e.g., 12-1 PM: 14.39, 7-8 PM: 14.46, 9-10 PM: 11.29). The resting heart rate is slightly below the population average (Resting Heart Rate: 56.4, Z-score: -0.21). Sleep duration is close to average (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 5 minutes, Z-score: -0.13), but the median sleep start time is notably late (02:25:00), with a standard deviation indicating some irregularity in sleep timing.

Considering the self-reported data, the participant demonstrates high levels of happiness and health satisfaction, coupled with low trait anxiety and average self-esteem, which are all factors associated with lower depressive symptomology. While perceived stress and subjective sleep quality are within average to slightly disturbed ranges, the overall trend from self-report leans towards positive psychological indicators. The strong negative correlations of happiness and self-esteem with CES-D further support a lower CES-D score. The wearable data, particularly regarding sleep timing and some periods of elevated heart rate, warrant attention, but do not present a clear indication of severe depressive symptoms on their own. The lack of significantly disturbed circadian rhythm metrics and relatively stable sleep duration suggests a degree of underlying physiological regularity. Given the predominantly positive self-reported psychological indicators and their significant negative correlations with CES-D, it is plausible that this participant falls within the lower half of the CES-D distribution.

Conversely, the participant reports slightly above average happiness (Happy Z-score = 1.64) and a slightly elevated perceived stress level (Stress Z-score = -0.17), though these are not strongly correlated with CES-D. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is noted as disturbed (PSQI Z-score = 0.13), with a moderate correlation to CES-D.

Exercise habits are notably active, with solo exercise occurring three times a week or more and sports participation 1-2 times a week, correlating negatively with CES-D. Daily recreation involves minimal sedentary activities such as watching TV, video games, or internet usage. Socializing with friends occurs for 15 minutes or less, with a significant negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting that limited social interaction may be associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived data reveal an average interdaily stability of physiological rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 0.58) and high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score = 1.58), suggesting less regularity in daily patterns. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly below average (Mesor Z-score = -0.78), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also slightly below average (Amplitude Z-score = -0.19). The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs in the late afternoon (4:08 PM). The resting heart rate is lower than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.54). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show significant dips during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM), suggesting periods of low physiological arousal.

The participant also engages in occasional napping (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = 0.61).

Considering the available data, the participant's profile exhibits several indicators that lean towards a lower depressive symptom burden. The robustly low anxiety and high self-esteem, coupled with frequent physical activity and sports engagement, are protective factors. The strong negative correlation between socializing with friends and CES-D is noteworthy, suggesting that even limited social interaction is associated with lower symptomatology, which might be interpreted as a preference for solitary activities that do not exacerbate depressive symptoms. While sleep quality is flagged as disturbed, the sleep duration itself is average. The elevated heart rate in the evening, particularly between 8-9 PM, could indicate physiological arousal that might be counterindicative of profound depressive lethargy. However, the participant's reported high happiness and low anxiety are strong indicators that would generally suggest a lower CES-D score.

Exercise frequency is low, with no reported engagement in sports or exercising with others, and infrequent solitary exercise (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.32, indicating slightly above average solitary exercise relative to the population but not overall exercise). Daily recreational habits are dominated by very low engagement in screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, as well as low engagement in socializing with friends (all Z-scores are significantly negative, indicating low time spent).

The Mesor, representing the average heart rate across the 24-hour cycle, is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.16). The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score: 1.13), suggesting a larger fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates. The Acrophase, or the time of peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (5:26 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.93). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-7 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.95 to -2.59), followed by a significant increase in heart rate deviation during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 11 AM to 6 PM, with Z-scores ranging from 0.42 to 1.3). Heart rate then decreases in the evening and night. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score: 0.77), which is longer than average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also slightly above average (Z-score: 0.25).

The participant reports no daily naps, which is average for the population.

Considering the psychological profile, the participant presents with elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, lower happiness, and significant interpersonal distrust, alongside moderate perceived stress. These factors, particularly the combination of low self-esteem and high anxiety, are often associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology. While objective physiological measures like heart rate variability show some regularity, the higher amplitude suggests potentially greater physiological reactivity. The very low engagement in social activities and moderate substance use might be compensatory behaviors or indicative of social withdrawal, which are common in depression. The late sleep start time, while not necessarily pathological on its own, contributes to a potentially disrupted daily routine. The strong positive correlation between STAI score and CES-D score (0.82) further emphasizes the potential impact of anxiety on depressive symptoms. Similarly, the strong negative correlation between Self-Esteem and CES-D score (-0.71) and between Happiness and CES-D score (-0.46) are significant indicators. The low trust score also correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.41).

Their reported happiness is below average (Z-score of -0.53), suggesting a potential for lower mood, which is a common indicator of depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is within the average range (Z-score of -0.17). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Z-score of 0.59), which is a significant correlate with depressive symptoms.

Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in solitary exercise three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07) and exercises with others and sports 1-2 times a week. This level of physical activity could be a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Daily recreational habits show a significant amount of time spent on video games (Z-score of 2.47) and internet usage (Z-score of 0.85), while time spent listening to music is below average. Socializing with friends is reported as 1-2 hours, indicating moderate social engagement.

The wearable data provides insights into the participant's physiological regulation and activity patterns. Their circadian rhythm exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.24), suggesting a regular daily routine. Conversely, intraday variability is notably low (Z-score of -2.08), indicating a less dynamic heart rate fluctuation throughout the day, which could be indicative of lower physiological arousal or engagement. The mesor (average heart rate around the rhythm) is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.34), and resting heart rate is also slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.39). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly elevated (Z-score of 1.05), suggesting a larger variation between peak and trough heart rate within the daily cycle.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals patterns of lower physiological activity during the early morning hours, with significant negative deviations from 2 AM to 8 AM, reaching a nadir between 5 AM and 8 AM. This is followed by an increase in positive deviations starting around midday and continuing into the evening, peaking between 10 PM and 11 PM. This pattern suggests a typical diurnal rhythm with lower activity during sleep and increased activity during waking hours. The acrophase (peak time of heart rate) is reported as 5:58 PM, aligning with the evening increase in positive deviations.

Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration of over 8 hours (Z-score of 1.28), which is generally associated with better mental health. However, the standard deviation for sleep duration is high (Z-score of 1.55), suggesting variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is very late, around 1:35 AM (Z-score for standard deviation of start time is 1.27), indicating a delayed sleep phase. The participant reports no daily naps.

Considering the available data, the participant presents a mixed profile. While reporting lower anxiety, moderate social engagement, and a healthy amount of exercise, there are indicators that suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptoms. The below-average happiness, disturbed subjective sleep quality, and late sleep start time are significant risk factors for depression. The low intraday variability in heart rate, despite an elevated amplitude, might suggest a less robust physiological response to daily demands. The correlation analyses provided are also informative. Lower self-esteem (correlation of -0.71 with CES-D) and lower perceived trust (correlation of -0.41 with CES-D) are linked to higher CES-D scores, while higher happiness (correlation of -0.46 with CES-D) is linked to lower CES-D scores. Although the correlations provided for specific metrics are not provided for direct CES-D score, the general trends for these related psychological constructs align with the expected relationships with depressive symptoms. Given the presence of disturbed sleep, below-average happiness, and the inverse correlations of self-esteem and trust with depressive symptomatology, it is likely that this participant would fall within the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

This pattern suggests a typical diurnal fluctuation where periods of lower cardiac activity in the early morning are followed by notable increases in the afternoon and evening. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.61) and a less variable sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.06), which generally aligns with good sleep hygiene. However, the median sleep start time is very late (1:31 AM), which, while not significantly deviating in variability, might suggest a delayed sleep phase. The mean number of daily naps is slightly elevated (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.94).

Considering the interplay of these factors, the participant exhibits several indicators associated with lower depressive symptomatology, notably high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, high health satisfaction, and a relatively stable sleep duration. The elevated heart rate during afternoon and evening hours, and potentially higher amplitude of the circadian rhythm, could be interpreted as a compensatory response or simply reflect normal daily activity patterns. While the subjective sleep quality is noted as disturbed, the objective sleep duration is long. The increased engagement in social exercise and sports, coupled with high self-esteem, suggests a degree of resilience. Despite some sedentary recreational habits and a very late sleep onset, the overall picture points towards a participant who, on average, experiences relatively lower levels of depressive symptoms.

50766,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile reveals a complex interplay of self-perceptions, lifestyle habits, and physiological rhythms, all assessed in the context of their CES-D score. Self-report measures indicate a generally low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.43) and a moderate level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.68), suggesting a stable disposition and a positive self-regard. However, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score above the threshold for clinical significance (PSQI Z-score: 0.13) and a higher than average score for perceived stress (Stress Z-score: -0.71). Notably, a strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (-0.71) suggests that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Conversely, a positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D score (0.28) indicates that increased stress is linked to higher depressive symptomatology. While happiness is reported at a slightly below-average level (Happy Z-score: -0.53) with a negative correlation to CES-D (-0.46), and trust is also lower than average (Trust Z-score: -0.46) with a negative correlation (-0.41), these do not appear to be as strongly associated with depressive symptoms as self-esteem or stress. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.97) with a negative correlation (-0.39).

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a mixed pattern of substance use and physical activity. They engage in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.19) and infrequent recreational or non-prescribed drug use (Recreational Drugs Z-score: 1.61, Non-prescribed Drugs Z-score: -0.11). Their exercise habits are somewhat contradictory, with low frequency of exercising alone (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.18) but high frequency of exercising with others (Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23) and moderate participation in sports (Sports Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational activities show a significant deviation from population norms, with very low engagement in socialising with friends (Socializing with Friends Z-score: -2.2), and minimal time spent on watching TV/videos/movies (Watching TV/Videos/Movies Z-score: 0.01), video games (Video Games Z-score: -0.56), internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score: -1.16), listening to music (Listening to Music Z-score: -0.72), reading (Reading Z-score: -0.67), and sedentary hobbies (Sedentary Hobby Z-score: -0.36). The low reported time spent socializing with friends has a near-zero correlation with CES-D (-0.01), while most other leisure activities show weak positive or negative correlations.

Physiological data from wearable devices indicate a relatively stable circadian rhythm, evidenced by high interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 1.57), suggesting a consistent daily cycle. However, intradaily variability is lower than average (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -1.16), which may reflect a less dynamic physiological response throughout the day. The participant's mesor (average heart rate level) is above average (Mesor Z-score: 0.66), and their amplitude (peak-to-trough variation) is also significantly higher than average (Amplitude Z-score: 1.63), with an acrophase (peak heart rate time) in the late afternoon (5:23 PM). This heightened amplitude and elevated mesor, coupled with a resting heart rate at the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.01), could suggest periods of heightened physiological arousal or stress. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals notable patterns of physiological activity throughout the day. Specifically, there are significant positive deviations during afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 3-4 PM Z-score: 2.58, 6-7 PM Z-score: 1.43, 7-8 PM Z-score: 1.35), indicating periods of higher cardiovascular activity than their average, and pronounced negative deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: -0.73, 4-5 AM Z-score: -0.75, 5-6 AM Z-score: -0.72), consistent with typical sleep-related heart rate deceleration. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration that is slightly above average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.37) with a standard deviation that is close to the population average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.03). The median sleep start time is very late (01:27:15), and its standard deviation is below average (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.63), indicating a consistent but delayed sleep schedule. The occurrence of naps is also slightly higher than average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.61). The correlation between median sleep duration and CES-D score is near zero (-0.0), suggesting it is not a strong predictor of depressive symptoms in this participant.

Considering the data, the participant's CES-D score likely falls within the bottom 50% of the study population. While they report disturbed sleep and higher than average stress, their high self-esteem and low trait anxiety are protective factors that typically correlate with lower depressive symptomology. The negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score is particularly strong (-0.71), suggesting that their elevated self-esteem is a significant contributor to lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant's stable circadian rhythm and average resting heart rate do not strongly indicate physiological dysregulation associated with elevated depression. Although their reported happiness is lower than average, the strong positive association with self-esteem and the negative correlation with CES-D suggest that their self-worth is a more dominant factor in their overall psychological state. The disturbed sleep, while a concern, is not as strongly correlated with CES-D as self-esteem, and their sleep duration is not notably short. The overall pattern of robust self-esteem and low trait anxiety, despite some reported stress and sleep disturbance, suggests a resilience that would likely place them in the lower half of the CES-D distribution.

Self-reported measures indicate elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.46), with a strong positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81). Conversely, the participant reports lower than average self-esteem (RSES Z-score: -1.57), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptomology. Perceived stress levels are moderately below the population average (PSS Z-score: -0.71), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (0.28). Self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score: -0.53), exhibiting a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score: -1.45), with a negative correlation to CES-D (-0.39). Interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.46) with a weak negative correlation to CES-D (-0.41).

Regarding sleep, while subjective sleep quality as measured by PSQI is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.33), this metric shows a weak positive correlation to CES-D. Objective sleep duration, as measured by the wearable, is notably longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.26), yet this metric demonstrates a near-zero correlation with CES-D, suggesting that while sleep duration is not a primary driver, other aspects of sleep or subjective experience may be more relevant. The stability of sleep duration and sleep start times are within the average range (Z-scores of -0.85 and -0.96 respectively), with moderate positive correlations to CES-D, implying that greater variability in sleep patterns might be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Napping behavior is absent, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.86).

Behavioral data reveal a pattern of reduced physical activity and increased sedentary leisure. The participant reports not engaging in any exercise alone, with others, or in sports (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.93; Exercised with Others Z-score: -1.58; Sports Z-score: -1.09). Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is reported at 1-2 times a month, which is slightly above average, but with negligible correlations to CES-D. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreation habits are characterized by significant time spent on internet usage (Z-score: 1.52) and listening to music (Z-score: 1.6), both with moderate positive correlations to CES-D. Watching TV/videos/movies and video games are also above average in duration, while reading and sedentary hobbies are also consumed at moderate levels. Socializing with friends is reported at 2-3 hours, which is above average, yet this metric shows a negligible correlation to CES-D.

Physiological data from the wearable reveal a higher than average resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.55) and a notably elevated Mesor (circadian rhythm average heart rate, Z-score: 1.77), both with weak positive correlations to CES-D. This indicates generally heightened physiological arousal. Interdaily stability of heart rate, reflecting the regularity of daily activity patterns, is above average (Z-score: 1.33) with a negligible correlation to CES-D, suggesting a relatively consistent daily routine in terms of heart rate variability. Conversely, intradaily variability, representing the fluctuations in heart rate within a day, is below average (Z-score: -0.81) with a negligible correlation to CES-D, indicating less pronounced within-day heart rate changes. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (Z-score: 1.23) with a weak positive correlation to CES-D, suggesting some regularity in daily heart rate patterns. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average (Z-score: 0.83) with a weak negative correlation to CES-D, implying that a greater range in heart rate may be associated with lower depressive symptoms. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:34 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor shows a distinct pattern of reduced heart rate in the early morning hours, particularly between 2-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -15.66 to -20.06, with generally weak to moderate positive correlations to CES-D. Heart rate increases in the late evening, with the 7-8 PM hour showing the largest positive deviation from the mesor (15.85), exhibiting a weak negative correlation to CES-D.

Overall, the participant exhibits a pattern of elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and below-average happiness and health satisfaction, all of which are known to be associated with higher CES-D scores. While perceived stress is not elevated, the high resting heart rate and Mesor suggest a generally heightened physiological arousal. The significant increase in time spent on internet usage and listening to music, coupled with very low exercise engagement, points to a lifestyle characterized by sedentary and potentially isolating activities. The notable increase in sleep duration, while seemingly positive, does not appear to mitigate the negative psychological indicators. The strong positive correlations between anxiety, internet usage, listening to music, and CES-D, contrasted with the negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, suggest that the participant's psychological state and behaviors are contributing to elevated depressive symptoms. Considering the combination of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and sedentary lifestyle indicators, it is likely that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

22688,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported psychological traits and objectively measured behaviors, which, when considered collectively, offer insights into their overall psychological state and potential for depressive symptoms. The self-report data reveals generally positive psychological attributes, including high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1), low anxiety (STAI score: 27.0, Z-score: -1.41), and notably high reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64). Health satisfaction is also high (Z-score: 1.22). However, the participant reports moderate perceived stress (Score: 23.0, Z-score: 0.38), which is a known correlate of depressive symptoms. Their PSQI score of 5.0, while classified as ""Good Sleep,"" is at the threshold for indicating potential sleep disturbance, suggesting a nuanced experience of sleep quality.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in regular social exercise (Frequency: ""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score: 1.23) and reports moderate alcohol consumption (""1-2 times a week""). Conversely, they report no recreational or non-prescribed drug use and a lack of solitary exercise. Their daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities, such as watching TV/videos/movies (""Do not do"") and limited video gaming (16-30 minutes), with less time dedicated to internet usage, listening to music, or socializing compared to sedentary alternatives. Notably, the participant reports no time spent on reading or other sedentary hobbies. The high GPA (average 3.92) suggests academic success despite these reported leisure patterns.

The wearable data provides objective physiological and circadian rhythm metrics. The participant demonstrates a relatively stable and regular circadian rhythm, indicated by high interdaily stability (Value: 0.27, Z-score: -1.15) and low intradaily variability (Value: 0.29, Z-score: -1.8) in heart rate, alongside a strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.11, Z-score: -1.79). Their mesor (average heart rate rhythmicity) is near population average (Z-score: -0.01), and their resting heart rate is slightly above average (Value: 60.4, Z-score: 0.27). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows generally lower-than-mesor deviations during the late night and early morning hours, with peak deviations occurring during the late morning and early afternoon. These patterns do not strongly suggest significant physiological dysregulation or overt deviations indicative of severe distress, but the lower variability might suggest a less dynamic physiological response. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration: 8 hours 2 minutes, Z-score: 1.05) with moderate variability in duration and start time.

Holistically, the participant presents with a dichotomy. Their self-reported psychological state is largely positive, characterized by high self-esteem, low anxiety, and high happiness. However, the presence of moderate perceived stress, a PSQI score at the threshold for sleep disturbance, and a tendency towards more passive recreational activities are potential indicators of underlying vulnerability. The wearable data suggests a well-regulated circadian rhythm and sleep duration, which are generally protective factors. The correlations provided suggest that higher self-esteem, higher trust, and higher happiness are negatively correlated with CES-D score, while higher perceived stress is positively correlated. Given the strong positive self-report measures and the indicators of physiological regularity, the evidence leans towards a CES-D score in the lower half of the distribution, despite the identified areas of moderate stress and less engaging recreational habits.

Regarding anxiety, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 43.0 falls within the range of chronic anxiety, with a positive correlation of 0.81 to CES-D, suggesting that higher trait anxiety is associated with greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), is within the average range (Score: 38.0, Z-Score: -0.03), exhibiting a notable negative correlation of -0.71 with CES-D, indicating that higher self-esteem is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is reported at a relatively low level (Score: 2.5, Z-Score: -1.42) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) to CES-D, suggesting that lower trust may be linked to increased depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is at a slightly elevated level (Score: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55) with a negative correlation of -0.46 to CES-D, implying that greater happiness is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is within the average range (Score: 22.0, Z-Score: 0.1), with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Health satisfaction is rated favorably (Score: 5.67, Z-Score: 1.05) with a negative correlation of -0.39 to CES-D.

Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug usage are reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-Scores: -0.31 and -0.11 respectively), with minimal correlations to CES-D. Exercise habits include exercising alone frequently (Frequency: ""Three times a week or more"", Z-Score: 1.07), but exercising with others is infrequent (Frequency: ""Less than 1-2 times a month"", Z-Score: -0.88), and sports participation is notably absent (Frequency: ""Not at all"", Z-Score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits indicate significant internet usage (Time: ""3-4 hours"", Z-Score: 1.52) and listening to music (Time: ""2-3 hours"", Z-Score: 1.13), both with moderate positive correlations to CES-D.

Wearable-derived metrics offer further insight into the participant's behavioral and physiological patterns. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals relatively low interdaily stability (Value: 0.31, Z-Score: -0.82), suggesting a less regular daily structure, with a negligible correlation to CES-D. Intradaily variability is within the average range (Value: 0.56, Z-Score: 0.1), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below average (Value: 0.26, Z-Score: -0.53), also with minimal correlation to CES-D. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is notably low (Value: 65.92, Z-Score: -1.1), with a modest positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Value: 12.58, Z-Score: 0.58) with a negative correlation (-0.1), indicating that a higher amplitude is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:55 PM. The resting heart rate is significantly low (Value: 47.5, Z-Score: -1.27) with a positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D, suggesting that lower resting heart rate might be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM showing significant negative deviations). Conversely, positive deviations, indicating higher than usual heart rate, are observed during the afternoon and early evening, particularly between 4-5 PM (Z-Score: 2.06) and 6-7 PM (Z-Score: 1.65). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 3 minutes (Z-Score: -0.16), which is close to average, with a negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting slightly better sleep duration is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is high (Value: '136 minutes', Z-Score: 0.8), indicating considerable variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:49:59), with average variability. The average daily naps are slightly above average (Value: 0.12, Z-Score: 0.61) with a positive correlation to CES-D, suggesting more naps are associated with more depressive symptoms.

Considering the available data, several indicators point towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The participant reports higher than average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17) which strongly correlates with CES-D. While self-esteem is in the average range, its strong negative correlation with CES-D suggests that any dip in self-esteem could significantly elevate depressive symptoms. Low interpersonal trust (Z-score: -1.42) and slightly elevated happiness (Z-score: 0.55) combined with moderate perceived stress (Z-score: 0.1) create a complex picture, but the negative correlation of happiness to CES-D is concerning. Significant internet usage and increased listening to music are behaviors that can be associated with withdrawal and rumination in depressive states. The high variability in sleep duration, along with a slight increase in napping frequency, are also common indicators of disrupted sleep patterns often seen in depression. Physiologically, the lower than average mesor and resting heart rate, despite a slightly higher heart rate amplitude and significant afternoon/evening heart rate elevations, could suggest a dampened overall physiological arousal that is disproportionately reactive during certain periods, potentially reflecting an impaired autonomic nervous system regulation, which can be linked to depressive symptomatology. The low interdaily stability in circadian rhythm further suggests a lack of consistent daily structure, often found in individuals experiencing depression. Given the strong positive correlation of anxiety and negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with CES-D, alongside behavioral patterns indicative of potential withdrawal and disrupted sleep, it is likely that this participant falls within the upper half of the study population for CES-D scores.

Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated (Z-score of 0.46), with a strong positive correlation (0.81) to CES-D scores, suggesting a potential comorbidity or shared underlying mechanism. Conversely, self-esteem is significantly lower than the study population (Z-score of -1.01), with a strong negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D scores, indicating that lower self-worth is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is significantly disturbed (Z-score of 1.98, indicating poorer sleep than 98% of the population), with a positive correlation (not explicitly provided but implied by the 'Disturbed Sleep' classification and expected relationship with CES-D) to depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is also lower than average (Z-score of -1.42), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) to CES-D, suggesting that reduced trust may be linked to higher symptom burden. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46), indicating that while happiness levels are not low, they do not mitigate the potential for depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is close to the population average (Z-score of -0.17), with a weak positive correlation (0.28).

Regarding daily behaviors and habits, the participant reports recreational drug usage occurring 1-2 times a week, with a high Z-score (5.44), and non-prescribed drug usage also at a high frequency, both exhibiting a positive correlation (0.16 and 0.17 respectively) with CES-D scores, albeit weaker than anxiety or self-esteem. Exercise habits are notably low, with exercising alone occurring only 1-2 times a month (Z-score of -0.43) and exercising with others occurring not at all (Z-score of -1.58). Sports participation is also absent (Z-score of -1.09). Leisure activities show a mixed pattern: significant time is spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.01), video games (Z-score of 2.47), and internet usage (Z-score of 0.18), with moderate positive correlations to CES-D for internet usage (0.25). Socializing with friends occurs for less than an hour (Z-score of -0.62) with a near-zero correlation.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal a less stable circadian rhythm compared to the population, indicated by low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.32) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.18), both with negligible correlations to CES-D. The mesor (average heart rate) is below average (Z-score of -0.74) with a moderate positive correlation (0.19), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also lower than average (Z-score of -1.0), with a weak negative correlation (-0.1). The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, occurs in the early evening (6:38 PM). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows pronounced deviations from the mesor during the early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), with the most significant negative deviations occurring between 4-5 AM (Z-score of 1.13) and 5-6 AM (Z-score of 0.23). Conversely, positive deviations are observed in the late afternoon and early evening. The resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.45) with a moderate positive correlation (0.19). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of just under 6 hours (Z-score of -1.5), suggesting chronic sleep deprivation, with a negligible correlation to CES-D (-0.0). The standard deviation for sleep duration is slightly higher than average (Z-score of -0.18). The median sleep start time is notably late (3:43 AM), with a very small standard deviation, suggesting a consistent, albeit extremely delayed, sleep schedule. The mean number of daily naps is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.7), with a moderate positive correlation (0.21).

Overall, the participant exhibits a pattern of elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, and lower interpersonal trust, all of which are significantly correlated with higher CES-D scores. Additionally, while recreational drug use is frequent, it has a weaker correlation compared to psychological factors. The observed sleep patterns, particularly the short duration and late start time, alongside reduced physical activity and increased sedentary leisure, are consistent with elevated depressive symptoms. The physiological data suggests a disrupted circadian rhythm which may contribute to or reflect these symptoms. The convergence of these factors, especially the strong negative correlation with self-esteem and positive correlation with anxiety, points towards a substantial burden of depressive symptoms.

Given the convergence of significant negative psychological indicators such as low self-esteem and high anxiety, coupled with objective and subjective measures of poor sleep quality and duration, and considering the correlations provided, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to place them in the upper half of the study population distribution. The profound impact of low self-esteem and high anxiety, which are strongly associated with higher CES-D scores, alongside indicators like disturbed sleep and potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms (e.g., recreational drug use), suggest a significant level of symptomatology.

Trust levels are also below the population mean (z = -1.42), and health satisfaction is slightly lower than average (z = -0.53). Perceived stress is somewhat elevated (z = 0.92). Notably, the participant reports engaging in prolonged periods of video gaming (z = 2.47) and moderate internet usage, while reporting very little engagement in social activities with friends and reading. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (z = 0.59), aligning with the significant duration of median sleep (z = 1.05) and a lower standard deviation in sleep duration (z = -1.04), suggesting potentially consistent but possibly excessive sleep. The standard deviation of sleep start time is also lower than average (z = -0.93), indicating a relatively consistent sleep schedule.

Wearable data reveals a highly regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability (z = 1.57) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (z = 1.82), suggesting a strong daily patterning of physiological activity. Intradaily Variability is below average (z = -1.24), which may reflect a less fluctuating, more stable daily physiological pattern. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is close to the population mean (z = 0.19), as is the Resting Heart Rate (z = 0.1). The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly elevated (z = 0.96), suggesting a wider fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pattern of suppressed heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-9 AM, z values between -0.03 to -1.81), followed by a notable surge in heart rate deviation during the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 1 PM to 4 PM, z values between 1.05 to 2.28). This afternoon/evening elevation is particularly pronounced between 2 PM and 4 PM.

The combination of high anxiety, low self-esteem and happiness, along with a disturbed sleep pattern and sedentary recreational habits, suggests a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology. While the correlation between some of these factors and CES-D score are not exceedingly strong, the pattern of psychological distress, coupled with sleep disturbances and reduced social engagement, aligns with characteristics often associated with higher depressive symptom burdens. The significant deviations in the diurnal heart rate pattern, with suppressed early morning heart rates and elevated afternoon/evening rates, could also be indicative of physiological dysregulation associated with mood states. Considering the overall profile, the participant's psychological and behavioral characteristics suggest they are likely to fall within the upper half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.01) and socializes with friends for a limited duration (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41). Notably, the participant reports minimal internet usage (15 minutes or less, Z-score -1.83), does not engage in video games, listening to music, reading, or other sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data indicates a generally regular circadian rhythm, with high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.5) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 0.64), suggesting a structured daily pattern. Intradaily Variability is higher than average (Z-score 0.88), which could reflect periods of increased physiological activity within the day. The participant's Mesor is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.3), and their Resting Heart Rate is also lower (Z-score -0.61). The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score 1.64), indicating a substantial variation between peak and trough heart rates. Analysis of Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor reveals pronounced elevations in heart rate during the evening and night hours, particularly between 6 PM and 12 AM (e.g., 8-9 PM with a Z-score of 2.91, and 11 PM-12 AM with a Z-score of 2.28), suggesting heightened physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, significant dips in heart rate deviation are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-7 AM), aligning with typical sleep patterns but with substantial negative deviations. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes (Z-score -0.39), slightly below the population average. Sleep start times are quite late, with a median start time of 1:58 AM, and exhibit moderate variability. The participant also engages in naps on average (Z-score 0.61).

Considering the correlation data, several factors align with higher CES-D scores. Notably, poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI, positive correlation with CES-D) is a significant indicator. While not directly measured by CES-D domains, lower self-esteem (negative correlation with CES-D) could also contribute to elevated depressive symptoms. The high amplitude of the heart rate rhythm, which can sometimes be associated with stress or dysregulation, and the significant evening/nighttime heart rate elevations, while not directly correlated, may reflect underlying physiological strain. Conversely, low anxiety, high self-esteem, and lack of substance use generally correlate with lower CES-D scores. The impact of mixed exercise habits and limited social interaction also needs consideration. The data suggests a participant experiencing significant sleep disturbances despite generally positive self-appraisals in other areas. Given the strong negative correlation between PSQI score and CES-D, and the PSQI score falling into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, this points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

95374,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures reveal a moderate level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.56) and a substantially lower than average level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.96). The participant reports feeling unhappy, with a Z-score of -1.61 for happiness, indicating a significantly lower subjective experience of positive affect compared to the study population. Conversely, perceived stress is within the average range (Stress Z-score: -0.71). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is notably poor, with a Z-score of 1.05, suggesting significant sleep disturbance. Social trust is also within the average range (Trust Z-score: 0.18), and health satisfaction is slightly above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.47).

Regarding behavioral patterns, this participant engages in very limited physical activity, with no reported frequency of exercising alone, exercising with others, or participating in sports (all Z-scores are substantially negative). This inactivity is coupled with a notable preference for sedentary leisure activities, including significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score: 2.47). Listening to music for 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.67) and socializing with friends for 3-4 hours (Z-score: 1.74) are also reported, though the Z-score for socializing is high, suggesting this is a more prominent activity for this individual. Substance usage across all categories (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with corresponding low Z-scores.

Wearable data provides further insight into physiological and circadian rhythm regularity. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is within the average range (Z-score: 0.42), suggesting a moderate level of day-to-day consistency in cardiovascular patterns. Intradaily variability is also within the average range (Z-score: 0.17). The MESOR, representing the average heart rate over the circadian cycle, is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.32), with a resting heart rate also lower than average (Z-score: -0.8). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Z-score: 2.06), indicating a greater than average difference between peak and trough heart rates within a 24-hour period. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is observed in the evening (7:41 PM), aligning with expected patterns.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced pattern of heightened cardiovascular activity in the evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (Z-score: 3.42) and extending through the late evening (e.g., 10-11 PM, Z-score: 1.91). Conversely, the hours closer to waking (e.g., 5-9 AM) exhibit significant deviations below the mesor (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z-score: -1.9), suggesting reduced physiological arousal during this period. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 15 minutes, which is close to the population average, though the standard deviation of sleep duration is high (Z-score: 2.68), implying considerable variability in nightly sleep. The median sleep start time is very late (03:11:48 AM), with a substantial standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score: 1.43), pointing to irregular sleep timing. The participant also takes a notable number of naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 1.75).

Considering the elevated anxiety, significantly low self-esteem, and low happiness scores, coupled with poor sleep quality and significant variability in sleep duration and timing, there is evidence suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The correlation coefficients, while not definitive on their own, generally support this interpretation: lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and poorer sleep quality are all negatively correlated with CES-D scores, meaning lower scores in these areas (higher self-esteem, higher happiness, better sleep) are associated with lower CES-D scores, and vice versa. The high amplitude of the heart rate rhythm and the pronounced evening/nighttime arousal, along with significant sleep fragmentation indicated by high variability in sleep duration and start times, could also be indicative of physiological dysregulation associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. While the participant reports no substance use and engages in minimal exercise, the combination of psychological distress, poor sleep, and sedentary lifestyle points towards an increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms.

71985,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"This participant presents with a mixed profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with some indicators potentially aligning with elevated depressive symptomatology. Self-reported data indicates relatively lower self-esteem (Z-score: -0.59) and lower health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.2), alongside moderate levels of perceived stress (Z-score: 0.38) and anxiety proneness (Z-score: -0.03). While happiness scores are slightly above average (Z-score: 0.55), the combination of lower self-esteem and health satisfaction warrants attention. Notably, substance usage is reported as not at all for all categories, and exercise frequency is varied, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07), but exercising with others and participation in sports occurring less frequently. Daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score: 2.47), and less time dedicated to reading or active socializing.

Wearable data reveals several notable physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average mesor (Z-score: -1.04) and resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.97), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates high interdaily stability (Z-score: 2.07), suggesting a regular daily pattern in heart rate, and a moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.03). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:37 PM), which is within a typical range. However, the mean aggregate deviation from mesor data shows a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: Z-score -1.2, 4-5 AM: Z-score -0.98) and a notable elevation in the evening and nighttime (e.g., 7-8 PM: Z-score 1.5, 9-10 PM: Z-score 1.21), which deviates from expected patterns. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score: 0.14), which is within the healthy range, and a median sleep start time of around midnight. However, the standard deviation for sleep duration (Z-score: 0.17) and sleep start time (Z-score: 0.35) are slightly elevated, suggesting some variability in sleep patterns. The absence of daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) is also noted.

The correlation analyses provided offer additional context, though they should be interpreted cautiously within the broader multimodal assessment. A positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D score (0.28) is observed, suggesting that higher reported stress may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, negative correlations between self-esteem, health satisfaction, trust, and happiness with CES-D scores are also noted, indicating that higher levels of these positive attributes are associated with lower depressive symptoms. The moderate negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D (r = -0.71) is particularly noteworthy. While some behavioral aspects, such as high video game usage (Z-score: 2.47) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28), could be indicative of withdrawal or avoidance behaviors sometimes associated with depression, the participant also engages in regular solitary exercise. The physiological data, particularly the unusual patterns in hourly heart rate deviation from mesor during late-night and early morning hours, warrants further investigation in the context of depressive symptomatology.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the available multimodal data, several indicators suggest a potentially elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports lower self-esteem and health satisfaction, coupled with moderate perceived stress. While happiness levels are slightly positive, these other self-reported measures, particularly the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score, lean towards a higher symptom profile. Furthermore, the significant time spent on passive leisure activities like video games and watching TV/videos/movies, alongside the observed atypical patterns in heart rate during nighttime hours, could signify maladaptive coping mechanisms or physiological dysregulation often associated with depression. Although sleep duration is adequate, variability in sleep start times and the negative correlations of certain positive psychological attributes with CES-D suggest an underlying vulnerability. Considering these converging lines of evidence, particularly the self-report measures and behavioral patterns, it is likely that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

43125,37.0,0.9715025906735751,"This participant exhibits several notable self-reported psychological and lifestyle patterns that warrant careful consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. A significantly elevated STAI-Trait score (Z=1.16) suggests a disposition towards chronic anxiety, which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). This indicates that higher trait anxiety is closely associated with greater depressive symptoms within this study population. Concurrently, the participant reports lower than average self-esteem (Z=-0.73) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D ( -0.71), suggesting that lower self-worth may also contribute to heightened depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is also a concern, as indicated by a high PSQI score (Z=1.52), classifying their sleep as disturbed. While the PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (data not provided), clinically significant sleep disturbance is often co-morbid with depression. The participant also reports lower than average happiness (Z=-0.53) and health satisfaction (Z=-0.70), both of which show a negative correlation with CES-D scores, implying that decreased happiness and health satisfaction are associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in higher than average substance usage, particularly beer (Z=1.72) and recreational drugs (Z=5.44), although correlations with CES-D scores for these specific activities are weak. Conversely, the participant reports minimal engagement in physical activity, with no reported instances of exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports (Z-scores of -1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). These findings suggest a sedentary lifestyle with a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (e.g., -0.22 for exercised with others), indicating that reduced physical activity may be linked to higher depressive symptoms. Daily recreational habits show a significant reliance on passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z=1.28) and playing video games (Z=1.71), which have a slight positive correlation with CES-D scores, suggesting these activities may be more prevalent with increased depressive symptomatology. Notably, activities like reading and sedentary hobbies are not engaged in, and social interaction with friends is reported at a lower than average frequency (Z=-0.62), with a negligible correlation to CES-D.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals certain patterns related to heart rate variability and circadian rhythm. The participant's mesor (average heart rate) is above average (Z=0.62), and their heart rate amplitude is significantly elevated (Z=1.36), suggesting a higher overall physiological arousal or variability. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (6:29 PM). The resting heart rate is below average (Z=-0.4), which is typical for individuals with higher fitness levels but may also indicate physiological adaptation. The hourly mean deviation from mesor reveals distinct patterns: significant deviations during late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM) suggest potential disruptions in cardiovascular regulation during these periods, particularly with large negative deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM). These periods of marked decrease in heart rate deviation from the mesor could indicate a suppression of physiological activity during sleep or rest. Conversely, the evening hours (7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM) show elevated heart rate deviations, suggesting increased physiological arousal leading up to bedtime. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Z=0.25) and intradaily variability (Z=-0.39), which are within a range suggesting some regularity in daily patterns, but not exceptionally so. Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration (Z=0.35) and a relatively stable sleep start time (Z=-0.82), though the duration and start time standard deviations are not provided for clear interpretation. The prevalence of naps is slightly above average (Z=0.82).

Considering the constellation of findings, particularly the elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, low happiness, sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity, and the strong positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D scores, there is substantial evidence pointing towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant's self-reported psychological distress (anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness) and behavioral patterns (sedentary lifestyle, passive entertainment) align with common indicators of depression. While some physiological metrics, such as resting heart rate, are within a healthy range, the specific deviations from the mesor during nighttime and early morning, along with the disturbed sleep quality, could be indicative of underlying physiological dysregulation associated with depressive states. The moderate correlations observed for some of these factors suggest they are indeed contributing to the CES-D score. Given the strength and direction of these indicators, particularly the anxiety and self-esteem measures, it is likely that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

98117,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with notable deviations in psychological and behavioral metrics. Self-report data reveal elevated levels of anxiety, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 53.0 (Z-score: 1.16). Concurrently, self-esteem is reported as relatively low, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 32.0 (Z-Score: -0.87), which is below the midpoint of the scale and suggests a poorer self-concept. Interpersonal trust is also significantly low, with a score of 2.17 (Z-Score: -2.07), indicating a marked lack of trust in others. Self-reported happiness is similarly low at 2.0 (Z-Score: -1.61). While perceived stress is within the population average (Z-Score: 0.1), the combination of low self-esteem, low happiness, and low trust suggests potential underlying psychological distress. Sleep quality, as measured by PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Score: 8.0, Z-Score: 0.59), exceeding the commonly accepted threshold for significant sleep disturbance.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage and minimal engagement in exercise, including exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports. Instead, daily recreation habits are heavily skewed towards sedentary activities. Notably, internet usage is high (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.19), as is time spent watching TV/videos/movies (2-3 hours, Z-Score: 1.91) and playing video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: 1.71). Socializing with friends is very low, with reported time of 15 minutes or less (Z-Score: -2.2). This pattern suggests a withdrawal from social engagement and a reliance on passive, solitary leisure activities.

Wearable data indicates a relatively higher mesor heart rate (Value: 80.99, Z-Score: 0.96) and resting heart rate (Value: 66.4, Z-Score: 0.98), both slightly above population averages. The participant's circadian rhythm displays some irregularity. While the acrophase is recorded at 6:27 PM, indicating a typical evening peak in heart rate activity, measures of rhythm regularity are mixed. Intradaily variability is notably low (Value: 0.3, Z-Score: -1.73), suggesting a relatively stable heart rate pattern within a 24-hour period, though interdaily stability is close to the population average (Value: 0.4, Z-Score: -0.08). The mean aggregate deviation from mesor data shows a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-Score: 1.5; 4-5 AM, Z-Score: 1.0; 5-6 AM, Z-Score: 0.59), which might reflect a disrupted sleep pattern or physiological adaptation to an atypical sleep schedule. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes (Z-Score: -0.71), which is below the typical recommendation, and a significant variability in both sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 234 minutes, Z-Score: 3.02) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 280 minutes, Z-Score: 4.33). These highly variable sleep patterns, coupled with a very late median sleep start time (04:03:17), are indicative of significant sleep dysregulation, which aligns with the self-reported disturbed sleep quality.

Considering the psychological measures, particularly the high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and low trust, along with significant sleep disturbances and a preference for solitary, passive activities, the evidence points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The low correlation values between most individual metrics and CES-D scores suggest that no single measure strongly predicts CES-D, necessitating a holistic interpretation. However, the constellation of anxiety, low positive affect, and poor self-regard, combined with sleep issues and social withdrawal, are consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology.

24883,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"The participant exhibits a profile characterized by elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, and a high degree of perceived stress. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 42.0 places this participant at the 0.07 Z-score, indicating a tendency towards chronic anxiety. This is further underscored by a low self-esteem score of 49.0, which has a z-score of 1.52 (note: the interpretation states higher scores indicate greater self-esteem, but the provided z-score for self-esteem is positive, suggesting the raw score is high relative to the population, and thus self-esteem is high, contradicting the notion of low self-esteem. Assuming the interpretation is correct about higher scores meaning greater self-esteem, then the participant has high self-esteem, with a z-score of 1.52. However, the provided correlation of -0.71 with CES-D suggests that higher self-esteem is associated with lower CES-D. If we assume the z-score of 1.52 means higher than average self-esteem, this would imply a lower CES-D score. Let's re-examine. The self-esteem score is 49.0, and the interpretation says scores range from 10-40, with higher values indicating greater self-esteem. This is a clear discrepancy. Given the negative correlation with CES-D, let's assume a high self-esteem score here. The perceived stress score is 23.0 (Z-score 0.38), indicating a moderate level of perceived stress, which correlates positively with depressive symptoms. The participant reports moderate substance use (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Socializing with friends is infrequent (16-30 minutes daily), and they engage in exercise rarely, particularly with others. Daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with limited engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. Health satisfaction is moderately low (Z-score -0.7), and their BMI falls within the underweight category.

Analysis of the wearable data reveals notable patterns in sleep and physiological regulation. The participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours and 53 minutes (Z-score -0.38), suggesting slightly shorter than average sleep, and the sleep start time is notably late, around 3:00 AM, with considerable variability (Z-score -0.3 for standard deviation). The cosinor analysis reveals a relatively low mesor (mean heart rate level) of 69.03 bpm (Z-score -0.67) and a low amplitude of 7.35 (Z-score -1.11), indicating less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed around 7:01 PM. The resting heart rate is also on the lower end at 52.2 bpm (Z-score -0.71). A key observation from the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations is a pronounced elevation in heart rate relative to the mesor during the early morning hours (1 AM to 3 AM, with Z-scores up to 2.82), followed by significant drops below the mesor during waking hours (e.g., 6 AM to 9 AM, with Z-scores down to -0.95). This pattern suggests a disrupted circadian rhythm with potential overactivity during early sleep hours and reduced physiological arousal during typical daytime periods. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (Value 0.29, Z-score -0.99), and intradaily variability is also low (Value 0.36, Z-score -1.31), further indicating a lack of regularity and pronounced daily fluctuations in physiological activity.

The confluence of high anxiety, low self-esteem (assuming the interpretation of the RSES is accurate and the score reflects high self-esteem, which would correlate with lower CES-D), high perceived stress, and a disrupted circadian rhythm with reduced physiological arousal during the day points towards a potential burden of depressive symptoms. The relatively low self-esteem, coupled with high stress and anxiety, are significant indicators associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. While the sleep duration is only slightly reduced, the late sleep onset and significant variability in sleep patterns can contribute to mood disturbances. The low amplitude and mesor of the heart rate, alongside the unusual diurnal pattern of elevated early-morning heart rate and suppressed daytime heart rate, suggest a dysregulated physiological system that often accompanies depression. The low interdaily and intradaily stability of the heart rate rhythm further supports a picture of reduced behavioral and physiological regularity, which is characteristic of depression. Given the strong correlations of key psychological distress measures (anxiety, stress, and potentially low self-esteem if the score were lower) with CES-D, and the physiological indicators of dysregulation, it is likely that this participant presents with a CES-D score that falls within the higher half of the study population.

66815,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The participant presents with a complex interplay of self-reported traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics. In terms of psychological self-assessment, trait anxiety (STAI) is at a near-average level for the population (Z-score -0.03), with a strong positive correlation (0.81) to depressive symptoms, suggesting that higher anxiety proneness is associated with increased CES-D scores. Conversely, self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 0.54), with a strong negative correlation (-0.71), indicating that greater self-worth is linked to lower CES-D scores. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score 0.10) with a moderate positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Interpersonal trust is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.47), showing a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) with depressive symptoms, suggesting that higher trust is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is also significantly higher than average (Z-score 1.64) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46), aligning with the notion that greater happiness is linked to lower CES-D scores. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.2), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is good, with a low Z-score (-0.8) and a score below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance, though a weak positive correlation (not provided) to CES-D would be expected for poorer sleep.

Behaviorally, this participant exhibits a preference for sedentary leisure activities, reporting ""Do not do"" for watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, and reading. Internet usage is limited to 16-30 minutes daily. Socializing with friends is also infrequent (16-30 minutes). In contrast, exercise frequency is low for individual activities (""Less than 1-2 times a month"" for Exercised Alone and Sports), but exercise with others occurs frequently (""Three times a week or more""), correlating negatively with CES-D. Substance usage (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, with low Z-scores, indicating significantly less usage than the population average.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a relatively low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.47), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is also low (Z-score -1.32). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates generally good interdaily stability (Z-score 0.83) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score 0.39), suggesting a reasonably structured daily rhythm. However, the autocorrelation at 24 hours is lower than average (Z-score -0.78), indicating a less pronounced daily periodicity in heart rate. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score 1.64), suggesting a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor. Notably, there are substantial negative deviations during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am, 4-5 am, 5-6 am, 6-7 am, 7-8 am, 8-9 am), indicating lower than average heart rate during these periods. Conversely, pronounced positive deviations are observed during the evening hours, particularly between 5-6 pm and 9-10 pm. These evening elevations in heart rate are particularly striking, with the 5-6 pm deviation being exceptionally high (Z-score 4.07), and the 9-10 pm deviation also being very high (Z-score 3.01). This pattern suggests a potential delay or shift in the typical cardiovascular activity cycle. Sleep duration is close to the population average (Z-score -0.11), with low variability (Z-score -1.38), indicating consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late (01:49:00), and the variability in sleep start time is moderate (Z-score -0.6). There are no reported daily naps.

Considering the confluence of these data points, the participant exhibits high self-esteem, high happiness, and high interpersonal trust, all of which are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores, indicating a protective effect against depressive symptoms. Their good sleep quality and low perceived stress further contribute to a profile suggesting lower depressive symptomatology. While anxiety is present, its impact may be mitigated by other positive self-reported factors. The behavioral data shows a preference for sedentary activities, but also regular exercise with others. The physiological data highlights a lower resting heart rate and consistent sleep duration, but the distinct pattern of heart rate deviations, with pronounced evening elevations, warrants consideration in relation to daily rhythms and potential disruptions. The strong negative correlations between key positive psychological indicators (self-esteem, happiness, trust) and CES-D scores are the most salient predictors of a lower CES-D score.

Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicate a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (approximately -17.42 at 4-5 AM), followed by a gradual increase throughout the morning and early afternoon, with a notable peak in deviation occurring between 10-11 PM. Resting heart rate is also below the population average (Z-score = -0.51). Sleep duration is slightly above average (Z-Score = 0.32) and shows less variability than the population (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score = -0.94). The median sleep start time is late (1:56 AM) with moderate variability. There are no reported naps.

Considering the self-reported high happiness and self-esteem, coupled with good subjective sleep quality, these factors suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. While there is high engagement in social activities and music listening, the moderate intake of alcohol and recreational drugs, alongside relatively low exercise frequency, are behaviors that could potentially be associated with higher CES-D scores, though their correlation coefficients are mostly low. The physiological data, including a below-average Mesor and Amplitude and a late sleep start time, do not strongly indicate elevated depressive symptoms, especially when weighed against the positive self-report measures. The moderate Intradaily Variability in heart rate suggests a somewhat disrupted daily rhythm, but not to an extent that definitively points to severe depressive symptomatology.

14847,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"This participant exhibits a pattern of elevated anxiety, evidenced by a Z-score of 0.86 on the STAI-Trait scale, indicating a proneness to chronic anxiety. This finding is notably correlated with CES-D scores (r = 0.81), suggesting that higher trait anxiety may be associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, the participant reports relatively lower self-esteem, with a Z-score of -0.45, and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score = -3.03), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r = -0.71 and r = -0.41, respectively), suggesting that improvements in these areas might be linked to reduced depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is reported at an average level (Z-score = 0.55) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.46). Perceived stress is elevated (Z-score = 0.65) and shows a slight positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.28). The participant's health satisfaction is also somewhat reduced (Z-score = 0.97) with a negative correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.40).

Regarding sleep, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score = 1.52), which is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score = -0.69), suggesting shorter than average sleep duration, which is negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r = -0.0). There is also a higher than average variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 0.46), indicating less consistent sleep schedules. The presence of a mean of 0.24 daily naps, with a high Z-score of 1.9, suggests a compensatory behavior, potentially related to daytime fatigue or poor nighttime sleep quality, and this metric shows a positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.2).

Physiological data from the wearable reveal a generally regular circadian rhythm, with a mesor heart rate of 74.67 bpm (Z-score = 0.1) and an amplitude of 9.52 (Z-score = -0.41). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:43 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is 58.4 bpm (Z-score = 0.03), which is within the average range. However, there is notable intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score = 2.01), suggesting more erratic physiological fluctuations throughout the day compared to the study population. Conversely, interdaily stability is below average (Z-score = -0.49), indicating less consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show some patterns, with the most pronounced negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate for that hour relative to the mesor) occurring in the early morning hours (e.g., 5-6 AM: -22.49, Z-score = -0.6; 6-7 AM: -21.81, Z-score = -0.62). Conversely, the late evening hours show positive deviations, with the highest observed during the 7-8 PM period (14.3, Z-score = 0.49), suggesting a potential shift in the typical diurnal heart rate pattern.

Behavioral habits indicate a high frequency of exercising alone (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07), with a negative correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.09). However, exercise with others and participation in sports are absent (Z-score = -1.58 and -1.09, respectively), suggesting a potential lack of social engagement in physical activities, which is negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r = -0.23 for exercising with others). The participant spends a considerable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.28) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13), both of which have weak positive correlations with CES-D scores (r = 0.12 and r = 0.25, respectively). Socializing with friends occurs for 2-3 hours weekly (Z-score = 0.95) and shows a weak negative correlation with CES-D scores (r = -0.02). Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.18) with a moderate positive correlation to CES-D scores (r = 0.25). Substance usage, including beer, wine, liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported as infrequent, with non-prescribed drugs not used at all.

Based on the analysis, the participant exhibits several indicators associated with higher depressive symptomatology. The elevated anxiety (STAI), disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), and lower self-esteem and trust are significant contributors to this assessment. The positive correlations between trait anxiety, perceived stress, and CES-D scores, along with the negative correlations of self-esteem and trust with CES-D, suggest a profile consistent with elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the short sleep duration, high variability in sleep start times, and the presence of daily naps point towards significant sleep disturbances, which are strongly linked to depression. The high intradaily variability and low interdaily stability in heart rate, alongside specific diurnal patterns of heart rate deviation, may also reflect physiological dysregulation that can accompany depressive states. While the participant engages in solitary exercise, the lack of social exercise and limited sports participation may indicate a reduced level of social engagement or motivation in certain activities. The overall pattern suggests a constellation of factors leaning towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms within the study population.

43382,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral traits that warrant detailed examination in relation to their depressive symptomology. Self-report measures indicate elevated anxiety proneness, as evidenced by a STAI score of 46.0 (Z-score: 0.46) with a strong positive correlation (0.82) to CES-D scores. Conversely, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Score: 32.0, Z-Score: -0.87), and this metric shows a moderate negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores, suggesting that higher self-esteem may be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is also at a relatively lower level for this participant (Score: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.46), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) to CES-D. Happiness levels are notably high (Current: 5.0, Z-Score: 1.64), and this trait demonstrates a moderate negative correlation (-0.47) with CES-D scores, aligning with expectations. Perceived stress is lower than average (Score: 18.0, Z-Score: -0.98), exhibiting a modest positive correlation (0.29) with CES-D. Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Score: 5.89, Z-score: 1.22), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.4) to CES-D.

Behavioral patterns reveal a significant lack of engagement in various physical activities. Substance usage is minimal across all reported categories, with notably low Z-scores for Beer ('Not at all', Z-Score: -1.12) and Wine or Liquor ('Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-Score: -0.55), both showing very weak correlations with CES-D. Similarly, recreational drug and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all"" with relatively low Z-scores and weak correlations. More importantly, the participant reports no engagement in exercise, neither alone nor with others, and no participation in sports. These frequencies have substantial negative Z-scores (Exercised Alone: -1.93, Exercised with Others: -1.58, Sports: -1.09) and are generally weakly correlated with CES-D, though exercising with others shows a modest negative correlation (-0.23). Daily recreation habits are varied, with moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes), listening to music (16-30 minutes), and socializing with friends (16-30 minutes). Internet usage is minimal ('15 minutes or less', Z-Score: -1.83), and reading is also infrequent ('15 minutes or less', Z-Score: 0.32). Notably, ""Sedentary Hobby"" and ""Video Games"" are reported as ""Do not do"" or very low engagement, with low Z-scores.

Wearable-derived physiological data presents a picture of a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Value: 63.4, Z-Score: 0.62), with a weak positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a higher than average Mesor (Value: 83.24, Z-Score: 1.27), also with a weak positive correlation (0.19). The amplitude is near average (Value: 10.64, Z-Score: -0.05). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is recorded at 4:54 PM, suggesting a later chronotype. Non-parametric measures of circadian rhythmicity show reasonable interdaily stability (Value: 0.45, Z-Score: 0.33) and lower than average intradaily variability (Value: 0.44, Z-Score: -0.74), implying a somewhat regular daily pattern but with less fluctuation throughout the day compared to the population. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (Value: 0.41, Z-Score: 0.73). Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower heart rate during late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, with significant negative deviations (e.g., -19.26 at 3-4 AM). Heart rate then increases progressively throughout the morning and early afternoon, with positive deviations observed from 12 PM onwards, peaking between 9 PM and 11 PM. These hourly patterns do not exhibit strong correlations with CES-D scores.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-Score: -1.27) and shows a weak positive correlation (0.01) with CES-D. The variability in sleep duration is slightly above average (Value: '120 minutes', Z-Score: 0.44) with a moderate positive correlation (0.2). The median sleep start time is approximately 1:28 AM, which is late, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is also relatively high (Value: '101 minutes', Z-Score: 0.39), suggesting irregular sleep timing. Mean daily naps are minimal (Value: 0.07, Z-Score: -0.08).

Considering the overall pattern of data, several indicators point towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The elevated anxiety proneness (STAI score and correlation) and the significantly lower than average sleep duration are notable. While self-esteem and happiness are reported positively, their moderate negative correlations suggest they might be protective factors rather than indicators of low depression in this specific context. The lack of physical activity, particularly no engagement in exercise or sports, aligns with common manifestations of depressive symptoms, although the correlations are weak. The physiological data, including a slightly elevated resting heart rate and Mesor, along with the late and variable sleep timing, may also contribute to a picture of suboptimal well-being. The combined influence of these factors suggests a tendency towards elevated depressive symptomology, placing the participant in the upper half of the distribution.

75438,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of self-reported traits and objectively measured behaviors and physiological patterns. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.52) and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.73), which is counterintuitive given a tendency towards lower happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53) and a moderate level of perceived stress (Stress Z-score: -0.98). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (Z-score: -0.33), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 2 minutes, which is significantly lower than the population average (Z-score: -1.43). This objective short sleep duration, coupled with the self-reported disturbed sleep, suggests a potential area of concern.

Wearable data reveals several notable patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm, as inferred from heart rate data, shows relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.66) and high intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.09), indicating a less regular daily pattern of physiological activity. The mesor (mean heart rate level) is slightly below population average (Z-score: -0.61), and the resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score: -0.61). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, with the most significant deviations observed between 3-4 AM (Z-score: -0.73) and 4-5 AM (Z-score: -0.51). In contrast, the participant exhibits elevated heart rates relative to their mesor during the afternoon, peaking between 2-3 PM (Z-score: 2.07) and 12-1 PM/1-2 PM (Z-scores: 1.55), suggesting a significant diurnal variation in physiological arousal. Sleep start times are consistently late, with a median start time of 1:43 AM, aligning with the observed early morning physiological lows and contributing to the overall short sleep duration.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94) and exercises alone with a frequency of three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07). However, sedentary behaviors like watching TV/videos/movies and reading are not engaged in (Z-scores: -1.25 and -0.67 respectively), while internet usage is moderate (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.49) and listening to music is higher than average (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.67). Socializing with friends occurs for 2-3 hours a day (Z-score: 0.95). Notably, the low correlation of many of these behaviors with the CES-D score suggests they may not be primary drivers of depressive symptomology in this individual, with the exception of potentially negative correlations for self-esteem and trust. The negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (-0.71) and trust and CES-D score (-0.41) suggests that lower self-esteem and trust are associated with higher depressive symptoms.

The participant's self-reported depression symptom burden, while not directly measured by CES-D in the provided data, can be inferred from related measures. The notably low median sleep duration (6 hours 2 minutes, Z-score: -1.43) and the PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (Z-score: -0.33) are strong indicators that could contribute to elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the negative correlations between self-esteem (r = -0.71) and trust (r = -0.41) with CES-D are substantial, suggesting that lower levels in these domains are associated with higher depressive symptomatology. While the participant reports low anxiety, their moderate perceived stress (Z-score: -0.98) and lower happiness (Z-score: -0.53) point towards a mixed emotional state. The significant physiological diurnal variation, characterized by early morning lows and afternoon peaks in heart rate, coupled with late sleep onset and short sleep duration, may also reflect disrupted internal regulation often seen in individuals with depressive symptoms. Considering the significant negative correlations with self-esteem and trust, coupled with the objective sleep deprivation and disturbance, it is probable that this participant's depressive symptom burden would place them in the upper half of the study population.

Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Z-score of -1.26). Interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Trust Z-score of 0.18), and health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 0.55). In terms of behavioral habits, substance usage is notably absent, and engagement in exercise, particularly with others, is infrequent. Daily recreational activities are skewed towards passive consumption, with limited time spent on watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and no reported engagement in listening to music or prolonged internet usage. Socializing with friends is also reported as infrequent.

From a wearable perspective, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest a relatively stable daily pattern, as indicated by an interdaily stability Z-score of -0.16 and an intradaily variability Z-score of 1.09. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly above population average (Mesor Z-score of 0.13), and resting heart rate is also elevated compared to the population mean (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 0.53). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Amplitude Z-score of -0.43). Examination of the hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with higher positive deviations observed during midday and early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM-1 PM, 12 PM-1 PM, 1 PM-2 PM, 2 PM-3 PM, 4 PM-5 PM) and negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours, consistent with physiological rest. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 43 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -0.58). The variability in sleep duration and sleep start time are within typical ranges (Z-scores of -0.33 and -0.39, respectively). Napping frequency is slightly above average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score of 0.21).

The analysis of the provided data suggests a CES-D score likely in the **bottom_50** percentile. While the participant reports some less than optimal lifestyle behaviors, such as infrequent social interaction and exercise, and a slightly below average sleep duration, these are not strongly correlated with elevated depressive symptoms according to the provided correlation data. The presence of low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and good subjective sleep quality are all indicators that typically align with lower depressive symptomology. The wearable data, while showing some deviations from population norms such as higher resting heart rate, does not present significant disruptions in circadian rhythm regularity or sleep patterns that are commonly associated with high CES-D scores.

27407,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. Self-reported measures indicate higher than average trait anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86) and a moderate level of perceived stress (PSS score of 23.0, Z-score 0.38). Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range, with a Z-score of -0.31, and reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55). Interpersonal trust is also reported at a slightly below average level (Z-score -0.46). Subjective sleep quality is notably poor, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0, placing the participant in the 'Disturbed Sleep' classification and with a Z-score of 1.52, suggesting a significant deviation from the population norm. This subjective experience of poor sleep is partially corroborated by wearable data, which shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score -1.17), indicating shorter than average sleep. The median sleep start time is notably late, at 02:02:30, with a standard deviation of 51 minutes suggesting some variability.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal a lower than average resting heart rate (46.3 bpm, Z-score -1.41) and a lower than average Mesor (65.18, Z-score -1.2). The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is within the average range (Z-score 0.47). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates a pronounced blunting of cardiovascular activity during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, Z-scores ranging from -1.55 to -1.67), which is a period typically associated with rising activity levels. Conversely, there are significant elevations in heart rate deviation during the evening and late night hours (e.g., 7-11 PM, Z-scores ranging from 0.91 to 2.25), with the most prominent deviation occurring between 8-9 PM (Z-score 2.25). The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is reported as 5:46 PM, which is within a typical range. Circadian rhythm stability metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.08) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.25), suggest a moderately stable circadian rhythm in terms of its overall daily pattern, with slight deviations from population averages.

Behavioral habits present a mixed picture. The participant reports moderate engagement in social activities with friends (Z-score -0.62 for time spent). Exercise frequency is reported as 1-2 times a week for exercising alone, with others, and in sports, with Z-scores ranging from 0.32 to 0.91, indicating a relatively higher engagement in sports compared to exercising alone or with others. Substance usage is generally low, with no reported use of wine/liquor or recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Beer consumption is reported as 1-2 times a month, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.3). Time spent on passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games is minimal (15 minutes or less). Internet usage is reported as 1-2 hours, which is slightly above average (Z-score 0.18). Notably, listening to music is not a reported activity.

Considering the provided data, the participant's CES-D score likely falls within the top 50% of the study population. This assessment is guided by several indicators of elevated depressive symptomatology. The significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score 1.52) and shorter than average sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score -1.17) are strong correlates of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the observed pattern of suppressed cardiovascular activity during the early morning, followed by elevated heart rate during the evening and late night hours, alongside a higher than average perceived stress level and trait anxiety, suggests a physiological and psychological profile consistent with increased depressive burden. While self-esteem and happiness are not markedly low, the combination of poor sleep, elevated stress and anxiety, and specific physiological patterns point towards a more significant level of depressive symptomatology.

Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of trait anxiety (STAI score of 55.0, Z-score 1.35) and perceived stress (PSS score of 26.0, Z-score 1.19). Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range for the study population (RSES score of 32.0, Z-score -0.87), and happiness levels are slightly below average (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Interpersonal trust is also somewhat lower than the population mean (Trust score of 2.83, Z-score -0.78). Health satisfaction is notably low (Score of 2.33, Z-score -1.45), while sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (Score of 8.0, Z-score 0.59), aligning with a classification of 'Disturbed Sleep'.

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94), no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and infrequent beer consumption. Exercise patterns are mixed, with infrequent solo exercise (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.43) but more regular exercise with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53). Daily recreational activities show a strong tendency towards sedentary behaviors, with significantly prolonged listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and minimal engagement in activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, socializing with friends, and reading. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable-derived metrics provide further insight into physiological and circadian rhythm regulation. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated relative to the population (Value of 70.8, Z-score 1.5). Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a notably low interdaily stability of heart rate (Value of 0.2, Z-score -1.73), indicating a lack of consistent daily rhythmicity, and a lower than average amplitude of heart rate variation (Value of 5.34, Z-score -1.76). The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 5:00 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pattern of reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am deviation of -7.8, Z-score 1.35) and higher heart rates during the evening and early night (e.g., 6-7 pm deviation of 9.03, Z-score -0.59). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours, which is close to the population average (Duration of 6 hours 59 minutes, Z-score -0.24), but with a higher than average variability in sleep duration (Value of 156 minutes, Z-score 1.25) and a relatively late median sleep start time (01:02:54).

Considering the available data, the participant exhibits a profile suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. High trait anxiety and perceived stress, combined with lower self-esteem and happiness, are core indicators. The disturbed sleep quality and significant irregularities in daily heart rate patterns (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude) are also consistent with depression. While some behaviors, such as regular exercise with others, are positive, the strong reliance on prolonged passive activities like listening to music and the overall lack of engagement in more active or cognitively stimulating pastimes (reading, sedentary hobbies) further support this interpretation. The elevated resting heart rate and increased variability in sleep duration are also potential correlates of distress. Given these factors, particularly the combined indicators of anxiety, stress, low mood, and disrupted physiological rhythm, it is plausible that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

51437,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of self-reported traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics. Self-reported anxiety levels are notably low (STAI Z-score of -0.62), suggesting a general disposition towards feeling calm. This is complemented by a relatively high self-esteem score (Z-Score of 0.96), which typically correlates with lower depressive symptomatology. However, the positive correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (r = -0.71) indicates that higher self-esteem in this participant is associated with lower depressive symptoms, a common finding. Perceived stress levels are slightly below average (Stress Z-score of -0.44), and this is weakly positively correlated with CES-D score (r = 0.28), suggesting that while stress is not a major concern, any increase in perceived stress might be associated with a slight rise in depressive symptoms. Happiness levels are also slightly below average (Happy Z-Score of -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.46), implying that lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is above average (Z-Score of 0.5), but shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.41), meaning higher trust is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Z-score of 0.3), with a negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.39), suggesting better health satisfaction is associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score of -0.33, indicating a score just above the threshold for clinically significant disturbance), which is contrary to their generally lower-than-average anxiety and higher-than-average self-esteem. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score of -1.16), which is substantially less than the average and indicates a tendency towards shorter sleep. The standard deviation of sleep duration is close to average, suggesting consistent (though short) sleep duration. The median sleep start time is very late, around 2:14 AM (Z-score of -1.12 for standard deviation, indicating a highly consistent but late sleep schedule), which is typical for individuals with circadian rhythm disturbances. Naps are not a significant behavior for this participant.

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a high average heart rate (Mesor Z-score of 1.29) and a low amplitude of heart rate variation (Amplitude Z-score of -1.59). This combination suggests a relatively high baseline cardiovascular arousal that is not fluctuating much throughout the day. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is late in the evening (7:39 PM). The hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor show significant elevations in the early morning hours (12-1 AM: Z-score 3.91; 1-2 AM: Z-score 2.04) and also a substantial deviation in the late evening (11 PM - 12 AM: Z-score 1.52). This pattern of elevated heart rate during periods typically associated with rest and sleep may be indicative of physiological dysregulation. Circadian rhythm metrics highlight a low interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.82), suggesting a lack of regularity in daily cycles, and a high intradaily variability (Z-score of 1.51), indicating frequent fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, despite the low amplitude. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below average, further supporting a less consistent daily rhythm.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent solitary exercise (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score of 1.07) and sports (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score of 1.58), which are generally associated with positive mental health outcomes. However, they engage less frequently in exercising with others (Frequency: 1-2 times a month, Z-score of -0.17). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with little to no engagement in video games, listening to music, or reading. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, which is close to the average. Substance use, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, is infrequent. The correlations between these behavioral and physiological metrics and CES-D scores are generally weak and mostly in the expected direction (e.g., higher exercise frequency correlating negatively with CES-D, lower happiness correlating positively with CES-D). However, the notable exceptions are the positive correlations of Mesor and Resting Heart Rate with CES-D, and the negative correlation of Amplitude with CES-D, suggesting that higher resting heart rate and greater cardiovascular arousal are associated with higher depressive symptoms in this participant.

The participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom 50% of the study population. While there are some indicators that might suggest elevated depressive symptoms, such as disturbed sleep quality, short sleep duration, late sleep onset, and physiological markers of circadian dysregulation (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, elevated heart rate during rest periods), these are counterbalanced by several protective factors. The participant reports low anxiety, high self-esteem, and above-average trust and health satisfaction. Furthermore, they engage in frequent solitary exercise and sports, and their substance use is minimal. The correlations between CES-D and most self-report and behavioral metrics are in the expected direction, indicating that deviations from optimal functioning in these areas are associated with higher CES-D scores. However, the overall pattern of protective self-reported traits and active engagement in physical activities suggests a resilience that may mitigate potential depressive symptomatology. The average CES-D score in the population is 13.33, with a median of 11.5. Given the constellation of positive psychological traits and proactive behaviors, it is more probable that the participant's CES-D score falls below the median.

21932,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"The participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological metrics. Self-reported data indicate low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -2.34), which are favorable indicators for mental well-being. Conversely, a significantly elevated self-esteem score (RSES Z-Score: 1.66) might suggest a compensatory mechanism, or a genuine high sense of self-worth, which needs to be considered in conjunction with other metrics. Subjective health satisfaction is moderately high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.55), while interpersonal trust is somewhat lower than the population average (Trust Z-score: -0.46). Happiness levels are also slightly below average (Happy Z-Score: -0.53). Regarding lifestyle, the participant reports minimal substance use, with only wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a month and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits include 1-2 times a week of exercising alone and with others, and sports participation 1-2 times a month, which aligns with moderate physical activity. Daily recreational habits are notably sparse, with the participant reporting ""Do not do"" for watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, with internet usage reported as 1-2 hours. Socializing with friends is reported as ""31 minutes an hour,"" which is ambiguous.

The wearable data reveals a sleep pattern characterized by a relatively long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score: 1.31), suggesting potentially restorative sleep. However, the sleep duration standard deviation of 50 minutes (Z-score: -1.15) indicates a consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is approximately 12:38 AM, with a standard deviation of 55 minutes (Z-score: -0.61), indicating some variability in sleep onset. The PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59) suggests disturbed sleep, which, when considered with the objective sleep duration, implies a potential mismatch between quantity and quality. Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate of 54.1 bpm (Z-score: -0.48) is below the population mean, indicative of a generally lower cardiovascular arousal level. The mesor of 69.72 bpm (Z-score: -0.58) also falls below average. Circadian rhythm analysis shows moderate interdaily stability (Value: 0.49, Z-Score: 0.67) and higher intradaily variability (Value: 0.68, Z-Score: 0.95), suggesting that while there is some consistency in daily patterns, there are also considerable fluctuations within the day. The amplitude of 12.13 (Z-score: 0.44) is slightly above average. The acrophase is recorded at 5:20 PM, indicating the peak heart rate typically occurs in the late afternoon.

Analysis of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of cardiovascular activity throughout the day. Notably, there are significant positive deviations during the late morning to early afternoon (12-1 PM: 24.18, Z-score: 2.59; 1-2 PM: 20.23, Z-score: 2.11) and late evening (10-11 PM: 26.39, Z-score: 3.14). Conversely, there are substantial negative deviations during the early morning hours (3-4 AM: -20.41, Z-score: -0.65; 4-5 AM: -23.51, Z-score: -0.89; 6-7 AM: -23.13, Z-score: -0.81), suggesting periods of significantly lower physiological arousal during what would typically be waking or early morning hours. The correlation coefficients between various metrics and CES-D score, while provided, are generally weak to moderate and do not suggest strong, consistent linear relationships that would override a holistic interpretation of the presented data. For example, the moderate negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score (r = -0.71) is noteworthy, suggesting that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, the moderate negative correlation for happiness (r = -0.46) and the positive correlation for perceived stress (r = 0.28) are also relevant.

Considering the available data, several indicators point towards a potentially elevated CES-D score. The moderately high PSQI score (Z-score: 0.59) suggesting disturbed sleep, coupled with a slightly lower than average happiness score (Z-score: -0.53) and a tendency towards lower interpersonal trust (Z-score: -0.46), are consistent with increased depressive symptomatology. Although perceived stress is low (Z-score: -2.34) and anxiety is also low (Z-score: -1.31), these are individual psychological traits and may not fully capture the nuances of mood states. The participant’s limited engagement in a variety of daily recreational activities, particularly those involving social interaction or engaging hobbies, could be indicative of anhedonia or low motivation, which are core components of depression. The substantial negative deviations in heart rate during early morning hours suggest a potential disruption in diurnal physiological rhythms, which can be associated with depression. While the objective sleep duration is ample, the subjective experience of disturbed sleep and the presence of significant physiological dysregulation during typical waking and sleep periods are concerning. The strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, and negative for happiness, further suggests that lower levels of these traits are associated with higher CES-D scores. Given these factors, particularly the disturbed sleep, limited engagement in rewarding activities, and physiological rhythm disturbances, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden likely places them in the higher range of the study population.

The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant detailed examination in relation to depressive symptomology. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is elevated (Z-score: 0.76), with a strong positive correlation (0.81) to CES-D scores, suggesting that higher trait anxiety is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively low (Z-score: -1.01), demonstrating a significant negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores, indicating that lower self-worth is linked to greater depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress levels are moderate (Z-score: 0.1), with a slight positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score: -0.33), with a weak negative correlation (-0.09) to CES-D, suggesting that while sleep is perceived as poor, it may not be strongly associated with depressive symptoms in this individual. Reported happiness is above average (Z-score: 0.55), with a negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, implying that higher happiness is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is also higher than average (Z-score: 0.83), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.42) to CES-D, suggesting that greater trust is linked to lower depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score: -0.7), with a negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D.

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed pattern. Alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, is frequent (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94), but shows a negligible correlation with CES-D. Substance use of beer is less frequent (1-2 times a month, Z-score: 0.3), with a near-zero correlation. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage are reported as non-existent. Exercise frequency is moderate, with a higher tendency towards exercising alone (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.32) rather than with others, and participation in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.91). Both exercise habits show weak negative correlations with CES-D. Daily recreational activities are dominated by screen time, with substantial durations spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64) and internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.49), both showing weak positive correlations with CES-D. Listening to music is a significant leisure activity (2-3 hours, Z-score: 1.13), with a moderate positive correlation (0.25) to CES-D. Socializing with friends is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16) with a near-zero correlation. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data provides insights into physiological regulation and circadian rhythmicity. The participant exhibits relatively stable daily activity patterns, indicated by moderate Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.44, Z-Score: 0.25) and Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.56, Z-Score: 0.1), with weak correlations to CES-D. The mesor of heart rate is slightly elevated (Value: 76.96, Z-Score: 0.41), with a moderate positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is average (Value: 10.79, Z-Score: 0.0), with a weak negative correlation (-0.1) to CES-D. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:23 PM). Resting heart rate is elevated (Value: 64.05, Z-Score: 0.7), with a moderate positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), with deviations ranging from -11.74 to -15.36, and moderate positive correlations to CES-D in some of these periods. Conversely, heart rate is elevated above the mesor during the evening hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (16.91) and 9-10 PM (12.74), with weak negative correlations to CES-D. Sleep statistics indicate a significantly longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 47 minutes, Z-Score: 2.0) and a highly variable sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 140 minutes, Z-Score: 1.26), both with weak correlations to CES-D. The low incidence of daily naps (Value: 0.08, Z-Score: 0.04) and a positive correlation to CES-D.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant exhibits several indicators potentially associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.76) and low self-esteem (Z-score: -1.01) are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores, as are moderate levels of perceived stress and higher frequencies of alcohol consumption. While happiness is reported as above average, its negative correlation suggests that fluctuations in happiness might be inversely related to depressive symptoms. The disturbed sleep quality reported by the PSQI, despite a weaker correlation, could also contribute to an elevated CES-D score. The substantial engagement in passive screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, coupled with lower engagement in reading and sedentary hobbies, could be indicative of reduced motivation or pleasure. Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate and certain patterns of heart rate deviation, particularly the prolonged periods of lower than average heart rate during sleep, might be indirectly linked to depressive states. The significant variability in sleep start times, despite a longer than average sleep duration, also suggests potential disruptions in sleep regulation. Considering the combined weight of these factors, particularly the strong associations of anxiety and low self-esteem with CES-D, it is plausible that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top 50% of the study population.

54030,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits several notable psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant detailed analysis in the context of depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures indicate a low level of chronic anxiety, as evidenced by a significantly below-average STAI score (Z-score of -1.41). Conversely, self-esteem is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.52, suggesting a strong sense of self-worth. However, this high self-esteem is contrasted by lower-than-average levels of interpersonal trust (Z-score of 1.47) and self-reported happiness (Z-score of 1.64). Perceived stress levels are slightly above average (Z-score of 0.65), and health satisfaction is also somewhat elevated (Z-score of 0.72). Regarding lifestyle behaviors, this participant reports no substance usage across beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, which is well below the study population norms (Z-scores ranging from -0.31 to -1.30). Exercise frequency is mixed; the participant does not exercise alone (Z-score of -1.93), but engages in exercise with others and sports 1-2 times a week, which is slightly above average. Daily recreational habits include moderate television/video viewing (1-2 hours) and internet usage (1-2 hours), with listening to music and socializing with friends also occupying significant portions of the day (31 minutes to 2-3 hours respectively). Reading and other sedentary hobbies are minimal.

Analysis of wearable-derived data reveals a disrupted sleep pattern. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 18 minutes, which is notably below the population average (Z-score of -1.09), and the standard deviation in sleep duration is higher than average (Z-score of 0.96), indicating inconsistency. The median sleep start time is exceptionally late, at approximately 3 AM, with a standard deviation of 88 minutes, suggesting significant variability in sleep onset. The participant also engages in a moderate amount of napping (0.22 naps per day), which is significantly above the population average (Z-score of 1.75). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced regularity, with a low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.07) and high intradaily variability (Z-score of 2.36) in heart rate, suggesting a less structured daily physiological cycle. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.73), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also reduced (Z-score of -1.29), with an acrophase occurring in the late afternoon (5:40 PM). The resting heart rate is within the average range for the population (Z-score of 0.03). Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly elevated heart rates during late-night and early morning hours (2 AM to 8 AM), with peak deviations occurring between 3 AM and 5 AM, reaching up to -12.77 beats per minute below the mesor, and again between 10 PM and 11 PM (14.19 beats per minute above the mesor). Conversely, during the midday and afternoon (12 PM to 4 PM), heart rate deviations are generally positive and closer to the mesor.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant presents with a complex profile. The low anxiety and high self-esteem scores are protective factors often associated with lower depressive symptomology. However, several indicators lean towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The significantly reduced median sleep duration, the late and variable sleep start times, and the increased frequency of napping are all consistent with disruptions commonly observed in individuals experiencing depression. The high intradaily variability and low interdaily stability in heart rate suggest a lack of consistent daily routine and physiological regulation, which can be exacerbated by depressive states. While the correlations provided are helpful, a holistic assessment is necessary. The positive correlations between higher perceived stress and higher CES-D scores, and negative correlations between higher self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction with CES-D scores, suggest that the current profile of elevated stress, lower happiness, and slightly lower health satisfaction, coupled with sleep disturbances and disrupted circadian rhythms, likely contributes to a higher overall CES-D score. The participant’s observed data indicates a constellation of factors that are typically associated with increased depressive symptomatology.

34062,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits several indicators of elevated psychological distress and maladaptive behavioral patterns that may be associated with depressive symptomatology. Self-reported measures reveal significantly lower than average self-esteem (Z-Score: 1.38, negatively correlated with CES-D) and higher than average perceived stress (Z-Score: 1.19, positively correlated with CES-D). Furthermore, the participant reports notably low levels of happiness (Z-Score: 1.64, negatively correlated with CES-D) and lower than average trust (Z-Score: -0.46, negatively correlated with CES-D). These psychological markers, particularly low self-esteem and happiness alongside high stress, are consistent with a profile that might present with heightened depressive symptoms.

Sleep patterns are also indicative of potential disruption. The participant reports a subjectively disturbed sleep quality, as evidenced by a high PSQI score (Score: 10.0, Z-Score: 1.52, Classification: 'Disturbed Sleep'). While the median sleep duration is within a typical range (7 hours 6 minutes, Z-Score: -0.11), the standard deviation of sleep duration is notably lower than average (80 minutes, Z-Score: -0.47), suggesting a more consistent, albeit potentially insufficient or fragmented, sleep schedule. The median sleep start time is late (23:24:31), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is slightly above average (95 minutes, Z-Score: 0.26), hinting at some variability in sleep timing.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest a less robust daily rhythm compared to the population average. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is low (Value: 0.36, Z-Score: -0.41), indicating less regularity in daily activity patterns. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also considerably low (Value: 0.22, Z-Score: -0.87), suggesting a diminished adherence to a 24-hour cycle. The participant's Mesor (average heart rate around the central tendency) is significantly lower than the population average (Value: 58.67, Z-Score: -2.08), and their Resting Heart Rate is also lower than average (Value: 45.7, Z-Score: -1.48), which may reflect lower overall physiological arousal. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals significant deviations during typical waking hours. Specifically, elevated heart rate deviations are observed in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 24.38, 6-7 PM: 22.33, 7-8 PM: 18.16), and during typical morning hours (e.g., 7-8 AM: 9.59, 8-9 AM: 15.03). Conversely, significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate for the time of day, are observed during late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: -11.79, 3-4 AM: -20.12, 4-5 AM: -21.97), suggesting a pattern of reduced physiological activity during the typical sleep period and increased activity during waking hours that may be characterized by heightened stress response or difficulty winding down.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) but abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is notably high, with the participant exercising alone and with others three times a week or more, although they do not participate in sports. Daily recreational habits include limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes) and video games (not at all). Internet usage is at a moderate level (31 minutes an hour), and listening to music is for a shorter duration (15 minutes or less). Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours daily. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies. The strong correlation between lower self-esteem and happiness with potentially higher CES-D scores, coupled with disturbed sleep and physiological indicators of altered circadian rhythm, suggests a potential predisposition to elevated depressive symptoms.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The available data suggests that this participant likely has a CES-D score in the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively elevated depressive symptomatology. Several self-report measures point towards this conclusion. The participant reports significantly low self-esteem (Z-Score: 1.38) and low happiness (Z-Score: 1.64), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Conversely, perceived stress is notably high (Z-Score: 1.19) and is positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting that higher stress levels are associated with higher depressive symptom scores. The subjective sleep quality is also reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-Score: 1.52), which is a common correlate of depression. Furthermore, physiological data indicates a less stable and less regular circadian rhythm, characterized by low interdaily stability (Z-Score: -0.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-Score: -0.87). The Mesor is also significantly lower than average (Z-Score: -2.08), and resting heart rate is also below population norms (Z-Score: -1.48). While these physiological measures are not directly correlated with CES-D in the provided data, they can often be indicative of underlying physiological dysregulation that accompanies depression. The presence of elevated stress, low self-esteem and happiness, and disturbed sleep collectively create a pattern strongly suggestive of a higher burden of depressive symptoms, placing the participant in the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

Self-reported data reveal elevated anxiety proneness, as indicated by a STAI score of 48.0 (Z-score: 0.66), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is at a slightly below-average level, with a score of 36.0 (Z-score: -0.31), and a moderate negative correlation with CES-D ( -0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is significantly elevated, with a score of 28.0 (Z-score: 1.74), and a positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D, aligning with the understanding that higher stress levels often accompany increased depressive symptoms. While the participant reports generally good health satisfaction (Score: 3.56, Z-score: -0.53), their subjective sleep quality appears to be disturbed, as indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59), which is above the common threshold for clinical significance and shows a positive correlation with CES-D. Happiness levels are reported as low (Current: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), with a negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, consistent with the expectation that lower happiness is linked to greater depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral patterns suggest a lifestyle with moderate substance use (Beer and Wine/Liquor used 1-2 times a week) and regular exercise (Exercised Alone and Exercised with Others 1-2 times a week), though participation in sports is notably absent. Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug use are reported as non-existent. Daily recreation habits indicate a significant amount of time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (31 minutes an hour) and moderate internet usage (2-3 hours), with limited time spent listening to music and socializing with friends. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in video games, reading, or sedentary hobbies. These patterns, particularly the higher engagement in passive entertainment like watching TV and extensive internet usage, alongside lower engagement in more active or creative pursuits, could be indicative of reduced motivation or anhedonia often associated with depressive states.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate data reveals a resting heart rate of 58.2 (Z-score: 0.01), which is within the normative range. However, the circadian rhythm metrics suggest some disruption. Interdaily stability is low (Value: 0.24, Z-score: -1.4), indicating a lack of regularity in daily activity patterns, which is negatively correlated with CES-D. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Value: 0.58, Z-score: 0.24), suggesting some fluctuation in activity throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Value: 71.11, Z-score: -0.39), and the amplitude, reflecting the extent of daily variation in heart rate, is notably low (Value: 6.21, Z-score: -1.48), suggesting a blunted diurnal rhythm, which has a slight negative correlation with CES-D. The acrophase, representing the peak time of heart rate, is reported at 5:40 PM. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM), which is expected for sleep, but then shows a pronounced elevation in heart rate during the evening hours (e.g., 7-10 PM), particularly between 8-9 PM (Value: 20.14, Z-score: 1.85) and 9-10 PM (Value: 14.97, Z-score: 1.21). This late-evening peak in physiological arousal, particularly when other indicators suggest low mood and potential sleep disturbance, could be a significant factor contributing to depressive symptoms. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 16 minutes, which is close to average, but the median sleep start time is late (01:19:30), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is relatively high (69 minutes), suggesting inconsistent sleep schedules. The mean daily naps are notably high (Value: 0.27, Z-score: 2.27), with a positive correlation to CES-D, which is a common indicator of depressive states.

The participant presents with a confluence of factors suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. Elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, high perceived stress, and disturbed subjective sleep quality all correlate positively with higher CES-D scores. Furthermore, low self-reported happiness and a high frequency of napping are consistent with depressive states. The physiological data reveals a blunted circadian amplitude, indicating reduced daily variability in heart rate, and a notable late-evening surge in heart rate, which, combined with sleep irregularity, may reflect a dysregulated circadian system. The strong positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D score (0.81), coupled with the negative correlation of self-esteem (-0.71) and happiness (-0.46), strongly points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

Considering the population statistics, the CES-D mean is 13.27 and the 50th percentile is 11.0. The participant's elevated anxiety (Z=0.66), high perceived stress (Z=1.74), disturbed sleep quality (Z=0.59), and low happiness (Z=-1.61) are all significant indicators that, in aggregate, suggest their overall depressive symptom burden is likely to be in the upper half of the distribution. The high level of perceived stress, in particular, is a strong predictor of higher CES-D scores. The positive correlation of anxiety with CES-D further reinforces this interpretation.

Exercise frequency is relatively low for exercising alone (Z-score = -0.43) and with others (Z-score = -0.17), though sports participation is more frequent (Z-score = 0.91). Daily recreational habits show a significant amount of time spent on socializing with friends (Z-score = 0.95), while other activities like watching TV, video games, internet usage, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies are within or slightly below average ranges.

Wearable data reveals several notable patterns. The participant demonstrates high interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.33) and low intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.52) in their heart rate, suggesting a highly regular circadian rhythm, with a strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 1.23). The Mesor (mean heart rate) is elevated (Z-score = 0.78), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also significantly higher than average (Z-score = 1.28), indicating pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is around 4:49 PM. Notably, the hourly deviations from the Mesor indicate a more pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM with Z-scores ranging from -0.79 to -1.34), followed by a sharp increase in the late morning and afternoon. Resting heart rate is very close to the population average (Z-score = 0.05). Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score = 1.5) but with a moderate standard deviation, suggesting some variability. The median sleep start time is very late (around 1:07 AM) with a relatively low standard deviation in start times, implying some consistency in late sleep onset. The absence of daily naps is also noted.

Several factors suggest a higher CES-D burden. The significantly lower self-reported happiness, coupled with elevated anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep quality, are strong indicators. The negative correlation between interpersonal trust and CES-D is also relevant, as is the lower self-esteem. While many behavioral and physiological metrics are not strongly correlated with CES-D, the overall pattern of lower happiness, higher anxiety, and disturbed sleep warrants consideration. The higher amplitude and Mesor of heart rate, along with the late sleep onset, could reflect underlying physiological stress or dysregulation.

Considering the available data, particularly the self-reported low happiness, high anxiety, and disturbed sleep, along with the moderate negative correlation of trust, it is plausible that this participant's CES-D score falls within the top 50th percentile, indicating a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

Exercise frequency is moderate (1-2 times a week across various categories). Daily recreational habits show a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64) and listening to music (Z-score: 0.67), while internet usage and social interaction with friends are closer to the population average. Notably, time spent on video games and reading is low.

Wearable data paints a picture of circadian dysregulation and altered physiological activity. The participant exhibits significantly reduced interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.98) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.79), indicating a lack of consistent daily rhythmicity. While intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.46), suggesting more fluctuation within the day, the overall circadian amplitude is reduced (Z-score: -1.58), indicating a dampened daily cycle. The acrophase, the peak of heart rate activity, occurs late in the afternoon (5:40 PM). The mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.4), and the resting heart rate is also higher than average (Z-score: 0.78). Examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM showing Z-scores between 0.95 and 1.56 for deviations from the mesor, and also earlier in the evening from 5-6pm with a Z-score of 0.52), with lower activity during midday and early afternoon. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes, which is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.32), with a relatively consistent sleep start time. The absence of daily naps is also noted.

Considering the CES-D population data, the participant's score of 11.5 falls at the median (50th percentile), suggesting that their overall depressive symptom burden is at the average level for this study population. The provided data does not explicitly indicate a CES-D score for this participant. However, interpreting the available indicators holistically: the lower self-reported happiness, disturbed sleep, and moderate substance use could contribute to elevated depressive symptoms. Conversely, high self-esteem, low anxiety, and stable academic performance might mitigate these. The most striking findings are the pronounced circadian dysregulation, characterized by poor interdaily stability and reduced amplitude, coupled with a relatively lower median sleep duration and a tendency towards higher heart rate during the night and early morning. These physiological and behavioral patterns, particularly the disrupted circadian rhythm, are frequently associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Given that the CES-D median is 11.5, and many indicators point towards challenges in sleep, rhythmicity, and mood, it is plausible that this participant's CES-D score would fall around the median, potentially leaning towards the higher end of the bottom 50% or entering the top 50% if these indicators are strongly correlated with CES-D. Without a direct CES-D score, a definitive placement is challenging, but the evidence points towards a CES-D score that is not in the lowest range. Therefore, considering the disturbed sleep, reduced circadian stability, and slightly negative mood indicators, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

84502,18.0,0.7461139896373057,"This participant presents a multifaceted profile, integrating self-reported psychological states, behavioral habits, and objective wearable-derived physiological data. Their self-reported psychological profile indicates relatively low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.33) and above-average self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: 0.4). Similarly, their reported happiness is slightly below the population mean (Happy Z-score: -0.53), while perceived stress is marginally above average (Stress Z-score: 0.38). Trust in others is also elevated (Trust Z-score: 0.83), and health satisfaction is notably high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.72).

Regarding behavioral patterns, this participant reports no substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs), with these metrics exhibiting significantly negative Z-scores, indicating infrequent or absent usage relative to the population. Exercise habits are mixed; they exercise alone less frequently than average (Exercised Alone Z-score: 0.32, though this is a positive Z-score suggesting higher than average frequency, contradicting the descriptive text '1-2 times a week' which is likely average to slightly above average. Re-interpreting based on typical distributions, '1-2 times a week' would fall near the median. The text 'Exercised with Others' indicates a frequency of 'Three times a week or more', which has a high positive Z-score (1.23), suggesting a significantly higher frequency of exercising with others compared to the population. Sports participation is less frequent than average (Sports Z-score: -0.42). Daily recreational habits show a pronounced tendency towards less passive activities; they do not engage in watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games, with very low Z-scores for these activities. Internet usage falls slightly above the mean (Internet Usage Z-score: 0.18), while listening to music and reading are performed for shorter durations than average (Listening to Music Z-score: -0.26, Reading Z-score: 0.32), which represents a below average duration given the positive Z-score here. Socializing with friends is also less frequent than average (Socializing with Friends Z-score: -0.62).

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a largely stable circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 1.16) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 0.81) are both notably high, suggesting consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Intradaily Variability (Z-score: 0.03) is close to the population mean, indicating a typical level of variation within a 24-hour period. The Mesor (average heart rate over the cycle) is below the population mean (Z-score: -0.94), suggesting a lower average heart rate. The Amplitude (peak-trough difference) is above the mean (Z-score: 0.53), indicating a wider fluctuation between high and low heart rate periods. The Acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is at 4:08 PM. The participant's Resting Heart Rate is also below the population mean (Z-score: -0.66). Analysis of Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor reveals distinct hourly patterns: significantly negative deviations (lower than average heart rate) occur during nighttime and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1am: -1.76, 1-2am: -1.57, 3-4am: -0.78), followed by a sharp increase in positive deviations (higher than average heart rate) in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5pm: 2.54, 5-6pm: 2.07, 6-7pm: 1.61). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 31 minutes (Z-score: 0.41), which is slightly above average, and a relatively stable sleep start time with a standard deviation of 65 minutes (Z-score: -0.39). Notably, this participant reports no naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52) indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, a finding that contrasts with the generally positive sleep duration metrics and stable start times, suggesting subjective sleep quality is a notable concern.

The participant's psychological and behavioral profile is characterized by low anxiety, high self-esteem, and moderate perceived stress, with no substance use. While recreational habits lean towards less passive activities, there is a tendency towards shorter durations of some activities like reading and listening to music, and less frequent socializing. Physiologically, they exhibit a stable circadian rhythm with a lower average heart rate and resting heart rate, but a wider diurnal fluctuation. The presence of significant sleep disturbance as indicated by the PSQI score (Z-score: 1.52) is a key outlier from otherwise generally positive or average metrics.

Considering the provided data, the participant's CES-D score is likely to fall in the **bottom 50%** of the study population. While the PSQI score suggests disturbed sleep, which can be associated with depression, other indicators such as high self-esteem, low anxiety, and consistent daily routines (as suggested by high Interdaily Stability) do not strongly suggest elevated depressive symptoms. The correlations provided, while weak, generally point towards a negative association between positive psychological states (high self-esteem, high trust, high health satisfaction, high happiness) and CES-D. The high PSQI score is a significant indicator of potential distress, however, in the absence of other strong indicators of depression within the CES-D domains (e.g., somatic symptoms, anhedonia, negative affect as measured by other survey items not fully detailed), the overall pattern leans towards a lower burden of depressive symptoms. The positive correlations of perceived stress and sleep disturbance with CES-D are noted, but the strong positive indicators of well-being and stability likely offset these.

78783,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics. Self-reported data indicate a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI, Z-score: 0.17) and perceived stress (Stress, Z-score: -0.17), though these are not markedly elevated relative to the study population. Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range (SelfEsteem, Z-score: 0.11), and trust in others is slightly lower than average (Trust, Z-score: 0.83). Notably, self-reported happiness is significantly below average (Happy, Z-score: -1.61), suggesting a potential discrepancy between objective stressors and subjective well-being. Sleep quality is assessed as disturbed (PSQI, Z-score: 0.59), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes, which is below the population average (Median Sleep Duration, Z-score: -0.39). The wearable data reveal significant variability in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation, Z-score: 1.99), indicating a highly irregular sleep schedule. Furthermore, there is a notable tendency for daily naps (Mean Daily Naps, Z-score: 2.23), suggesting attempts to compensate for insufficient or disrupted nighttime sleep.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Resting Heart Rate, Z-score: -0.64), with a mesor (average heart rate) also being below average (Mesor, Z-score: -0.58). The circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively stable intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability, Z-score: 0.24), but a lower-than-average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability, Z-score: -0.41), suggesting some disruption in the daily rhythm regularity. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals pronounced deviations from the mesor, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours. Specifically, large negative deviations are observed between 3-4 AM (Z-score: 0.61) and 4-5 AM (Z-score: 0.55), suggesting periods of unusually low physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, there are notable positive deviations during late evening and early morning waking hours, such as 7-8 PM (Z-score: 1.01) and 10-11 PM (Z-score: 1.58), which may reflect periods of increased arousal or fragmented sleep transitions. Behavioral data indicate a pattern of frequent engagement in sedentary activities, including watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64) and playing video games (Z-score: 1.71) for extended periods. Exercise frequency is moderate, with solo exercise occurring three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07), and exercise with others and sports participation occurring less frequently. Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is reported at a low frequency.

The participant's CES-D score is likely in the **bottom_50** of the study population distribution. While there are indicators of potential concern, such as significantly low self-reported happiness, disturbed sleep quality, and highly irregular sleep patterns, these are not consistently associated with high CES-D scores in the provided correlations. The negative correlation between happiness and CES-D (Score Correlation: -0.46) suggests that lower happiness is associated with higher CES-D, which aligns with this participant's low happiness score. However, other measures that typically correlate with depression, such as self-esteem (Score Correlation: -0.71) and trust (Score Correlation: -0.41), are not particularly low for this participant, with self-esteem being in the average range and trust being only slightly below average. The PSQI score (Z-score: 0.59) indicates disturbed sleep, but the correlation with CES-D is not provided. The significant irregularity in sleep start times (Z-score: 1.99) and frequent napping (Z-score: 2.23) are notable but lack direct correlation data with CES-D. The physiological data, including resting heart rate and mesor being below average, along with specific patterns of heart rate deviation during the night, do not have strong or consistently negative correlations with CES-D that would strongly suggest elevated depressive symptoms. In summary, while aspects of this participant's well-being and sleep are suboptimal, the available data, particularly the moderate self-esteem and trust scores, and the lack of strong negative correlations with key indicators, do not strongly point towards a high CES-D burden.

Self-report data indicate elevated levels of anxiety, as reflected by a high STAI score (Z-score = 0.86), and lower self-esteem (Score = 44.0, Z-Score = 0.82) when considering that higher scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale represent greater self-esteem. There is also a notable tendency towards perceived stress (Score = 25.0, Z-score = 0.92), with a moderate correlation with CES-D scores. While general happiness is reported at a level slightly below average (Z-Score = -0.53), indicating a potential deficit in positive affect, the correlation with CES-D is moderate. Interpersonal trust is reported at a slightly below average level (Z-Score = -0.14), with a negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting that lower trust might be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Notably, health satisfaction is exceptionally high (Z-score = 1.63), which, while positive, does not align with the other indicators of potential distress. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported at a frequency of 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively) and shows a weak negative correlation with CES-D scores, suggesting it may not be strongly indicative of current depressive symptoms. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage are reported as ""Not at all.""

The participant's behavioral patterns, as indicated by self-report and wearable data, present a mixed profile. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, falls within the average range (Z-scores of 0.32 and 0.53 respectively) with weak negative correlations to CES-D, suggesting it is not a significant compensatory behavior or a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. Sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games are engaged in minimally or for short durations, with a notable lack of engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score = -1.25). Internet usage and listening to music are within average to below-average time allocations, with moderate positive correlations for internet usage and listening to music with CES-D. Socializing with friends is reported as occurring for 31 minutes an hour, which is a below-average time allocation (Z-score = -0.62) and shows a negligible correlation with CES-D. Sleep metrics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score = -0.77), and a relatively stable sleep schedule (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score = -0.58). The PSQI score of 7.0 suggests a degree of disturbed sleep, which aligns with common indicators of depressive symptomatology, although this score is only marginally above average (Z-Score = 0.13).

Physiological data derived from the wearable device provides insights into the participant's circadian rhythm and cardiovascular activity. The participant's resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-Score = -0.68). The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is also below average (Z-Score = -0.85). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average (Z-Score = 0.64), indicating a larger variation between peak and trough heart rates, and the acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon. The interdaily stability of heart rate is close to average (Z-Score = 0.09), suggesting a reasonable consistency in daily heart rate patterns. However, intradaily variability is below average (Z-Score = -0.53), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate within a given day. The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals periods of significantly elevated heart rate during the mid-afternoon (e.g., 3-4 PM, Z-score = 5.3) and late afternoon (e.g., 4-5 PM, Z-score = 1.48), which are considerably higher than the population average. Conversely, heart rate remains notably below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2-5 AM. These pronounced dips and peaks in heart rate deviation, especially the significant elevation in the afternoon, warrant further attention in relation to potential stress responses or other physiological states. The negative correlations of most hourly mean deviations with CES-D suggest that higher deviations, particularly during periods of elevated heart rate, might be associated with lower CES-D scores, a finding that is counterintuitive and requires careful consideration.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant exhibits several indicators that may be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The co-occurrence of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and increased perceived stress are strong psychological markers. The somewhat disturbed sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, along with below-average social interaction time, further contribute to this profile. While some physiological metrics like resting heart rate and mesor are below average, the significant peaks in hourly heart rate deviation during the afternoon could be interpreted in various ways, but in the context of other stressors, could indicate a physiological response to stress. The moderate positive correlations of perceived stress and happiness with CES-D are in the expected direction, and the negative correlations for self-esteem and trust, while generally indicative of lower scores, suggest these traits are indeed associated with the outcome measure. Given the convergence of multiple psychological distress indicators, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

23270,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The participant exhibits several self-reported characteristics that warrant attention in the context of depressive symptomatology. Notably, their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score is elevated (Z-score = 0.56), suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety, which often co-occurs with depressive symptoms. This finding is further supported by a moderate positive correlation between STAI score and CES-D, indicating that higher anxiety is associated with higher depressive symptom scores. Conversely, their self-esteem score is within the average range (Z-score = -0.17), with a notable negative correlation to CES-D, implying that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also moderately elevated (Z-score = -0.71), with a positive correlation to CES-D, suggesting that increased appraisals of stress are linked to greater depressive symptom severity. While subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as good (Z-score = -1.26), indicating no significant sleep disturbance, the median sleep duration is notably long (8 hours 49 minutes, Z-score = 2.03). This, however, does not correlate significantly with CES-D scores. The participant reports high academic achievement, with GPAs consistently at or near 4.0, which is generally a positive indicator. Interpersonal trust is reported at an average level (Z-score = -0.46), with a mild negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting a slight association between higher trust and lower depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (Z-score = 0.55), with a negative correlation to CES-D, implying that lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Substance usage is reported as non-existent across all categories, and a pattern of regular exercise is observed, particularly in solitary activities and sports, which are generally considered protective factors against depression. Daily recreation habits are characterized by a notable absence of passive activities like watching TV, video games, and listening to music, and limited time spent on internet usage and sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is reported as infrequent (16-30 minutes), with a negligible correlation to CES-D.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological and behavioral data reveals a generally regular and stable circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is within the average range (Z-score = -0.24), and intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.39), suggesting a moderately active daily pattern. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is close to the population mean (Z-score = -0.03), indicating good consistency in daily heart rate patterns. The mesor of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.61), and the amplitude is near the population average (Z-score = -0.02), suggesting a moderate range of heart rate variation. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, is recorded at 2:42 PM, which falls within the typical diurnal variation. The resting heart rate is below average (Z-score = -0.39), which is a positive physiological indicator. Examining the hourly deviation of mean heart rate from the mesor reveals periods of significantly lower heart rate during the late-night and early-morning hours, particularly between 12-1 AM (Z-score = -1.9) and 1-2 AM (Z-score = -1.23). Conversely, there are pronounced elevations in heart rate deviation during mid-morning to early afternoon, with notable peaks between 9-10 AM (Z-score = 2.06) and 10-11 AM (Z-score = 1.92), and again in the early afternoon between 12-1 PM (Z-score = 1.49). These patterns suggest a typical diurnal arousal cycle, with subdued activity during sleep and increased activity during waking hours. The correlations between these hourly heart rate deviations and CES-D scores are generally small and inconsistent, with a few weak negative correlations during waking hours. Sleep statistics indicate a notably long median sleep duration (Z-score = 2.03), but this does not correlate significantly with CES-D. The standard deviations for sleep duration and sleep start time are within average ranges, indicating consistent sleep timing. The absence of daily naps (Z-score = -0.86) is also noted.

Self-report data reveal elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.86, correlation with CES-D: 0.81) and significant perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 2.01, correlation with CES-D: 0.28), suggesting a predisposition towards heightened negative affect and a feeling of being overwhelmed. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range for the population (RSES Z-score: 0.11, correlation with CES-D: -0.71), indicating that their sense of self-worth is not a primary contributor to elevated depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is notably low (Z-score: -1.74, correlation with CES-D: -0.41), which could reflect or exacerbate feelings of isolation and negative social perception, common in depressive states. Subjective happiness is also reported to be lower than average (Z-score: 0.55, correlation with CES-D: -0.46), aligning with general mood deficits. Health satisfaction is marginally below the population mean (Z-score: -0.95, correlation with CES-D: -0.39), potentially reflecting the impact of psychological distress on overall well-being.

Behavioral patterns indicate a mixed profile. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is above average for the population (Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), though correlations with CES-D are negligible. Exercise frequency is also higher than average, particularly exercising alone (Z-score: 1.07), suggesting an attempt to engage in health-promoting behaviors, yet the correlation with CES-D is weak. Daily recreational habits show a tendency towards passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music for limited durations, and a lack of engagement in reading or video games. Notably, internet usage is higher than average (Z-score: 0.85), which could be a means of social connection or escapism, but the correlation with CES-D is moderately positive. Socializing with friends is reported for a moderate duration, with a near-zero correlation to CES-D.

Physiological data from the wearable device suggest a potentially dysregulated circadian rhythm and sleep patterns that may contribute to depressive symptoms. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate are lower than average (Z-scores: -0.57 and -0.25 respectively), indicating less regularity in daily activity and physiological patterns. The Mesor and Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm are also below population averages (Z-scores: -0.41 and -0.52 respectively), suggesting a dampened diurnal variation in heart rate, which has been linked to depressive states. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon, which is within a typical range. Resting heart rate is lower than average (Z-score: -0.61), which could be indicative of reduced physiological arousal. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal periods of significantly lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-5 AM), potentially reflecting deep sleep or reduced metabolic activity during these times. Conversely, evenings show higher deviations, particularly between 7-8 PM and 9-10 PM, which might indicate periods of heightened alertness or stress reactivity. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration that is slightly below average (6 hours 57 minutes), with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: 1.32), suggesting variability and potential disruption. The median sleep start time is late (01:44:30), with moderate variability. The presence of naps is minimal. The observed patterns of reduced circadian amplitude, lower interdaily stability, and potentially disrupted sleep architecture, alongside high trait anxiety and perceived stress, are all commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology.

Based on the totality of the evidence, the participant's profile suggests a greater likelihood of experiencing elevated depressive symptoms, placing them in the top 50% of the CES-D distribution. The combination of high trait anxiety, high perceived stress, low interpersonal trust, and lower-than-average self-reported happiness, when considered alongside physiological markers such as reduced circadian rhythm amplitude and stability, and sleep disturbances (variable sleep duration, late sleep onset), collectively point towards a higher burden of depressive symptomatology. While self-esteem is within the average range, it does not outweigh the significant indicators of distress. The moderate to strong correlations of key psychological variables (STAI, Self-Esteem, Trust, Happy) with CES-D further support this conclusion, with anxiousness and lower happiness showing positive associations, and self-esteem and trust showing negative associations, as expected for a measure of depression.

Behavioral patterns include moderate substance usage (1-2 times a week for wine or liquor) and consistent engagement in sedentary activities, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28), playing video games (1-2 hours, Z=2.47), and using the internet (2-3 hours, Z=0.85). Socializing with friends also occupies a substantial amount of time (more than 4 hours, Z=2.53). While exercise frequency is around once or twice a week, it is primarily done alone. Wearable data indicates a stable, yet somewhat rigid, circadian rhythm, with high interdaily stability (Value=0.52, Z=0.91) and moderate autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value=0.47, Z=1.23), but also a high intraday variability in heart rate (Value=0.5, Z=-0.32). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a consistent pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, with deviations from the mesor becoming progressively more negative until approximately 6 AM. Heart rate then increases through the morning and afternoon, with peaks in deviation observed in the late evening (9-10 PM and 10-11 PM). Sleep duration is slightly above average (Median 7 hours 16 minutes, Z=0.1), but the sleep start time shows considerable variability (Standard Deviation 110 minutes, Z=0.59).

The participant's elevated anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with low self-esteem and happiness, and disturbed sleep, are all indicators that align with the higher end of the depressive symptom spectrum. The moderate correlation between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81), and between perceived stress and CES-D (0.27), further support this. While self-esteem and trust have negative correlations with CES-D, their lower scores suggest a potential contribution to increased depressive symptoms. The observed physiological patterns, such as elevated resting heart rate and Mesor, could reflect a state of chronic arousal often associated with higher stress and anxiety, which can be comorbid with depressive symptoms. The sedentary lifestyle and significant engagement in passive entertainment may also be indicative of reduced motivation and anhedonia, common in depression. Considering these multifaceted indicators, the participant's data collectively points towards a higher burden of depressive symptomatology.

Physiological data from the wearable device indicate a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as suggested by a high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.0) and a typical intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.04). The mesor of heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.16), and the resting heart rate is also below average (Z-score of -0.87), indicating a generally lower cardiovascular load. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Z-score of 1.29), suggesting a substantial variation in heart rate throughout the day. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly reduced heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z-score of -0.89; 3-4 AM, Z-score of -0.95; 5-6 AM, Z-score of -1.42), and increased heart rate during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 2-3 PM, Z-score of 2.23; 8-9 PM, Z-score of 2.1; 9-10 PM, Z-score of 2.14). Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes, which is close to the population average, with a lower than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of -0.86), suggesting consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around 1:44 AM, with a moderate standard deviation. Napping frequency is slightly above average.

The observed correlations between various metrics and CES-D scores provide further context. A strong positive correlation exists between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81), suggesting that higher trait anxiety is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, a strong negative correlation exists between self-esteem and CES-D (-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Higher interpersonal trust also shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41), implying that greater trust is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Similarly, higher reported happiness is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Perceived stress, while below average, shows a positive correlation with CES-D (0.28), suggesting a tendency for increased stress to be associated with higher depressive symptoms. The correlation between PSQI score and CES-D is near zero, indicating that subjective sleep quality alone does not strongly predict CES-D scores in this participant. Wearable data shows weak correlations with CES-D; however, higher amplitude of heart rate circadian rhythm is negatively correlated (-0.1) and mesor is positively correlated (0.19), suggesting potential links between physiological rhythmicity and depressive symptoms, albeit weakly.

Based on the holistic analysis of the provided data, the participant's profile suggests a moderate burden of depressive symptoms. While self-esteem is high and anxiety is low, there are indicators that lean towards elevated CES-D scores. The strong positive correlation between STAI (anxiety) and CES-D, coupled with the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, suggests that if the participant experiences increased anxiety or decreased self-esteem, their depressive symptomology would likely increase significantly. The slightly below average self-reported happiness and the presence of disturbed sleep, while not extremely pronounced, are also indicators that align with higher CES-D scores. The participant's relatively regular circadian rhythm and average sleep duration, while positive factors, do not strongly counteract these other indicators. Considering the interplay of these factors, particularly the significant correlations with anxiety and self-esteem, and the presence of disturbed sleep, it is likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

67177,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"The participant presents a complex profile with notable variances across multiple psychological and behavioral domains. Self-reported measures indicate a significant level of chronic anxiety, as evidenced by a high STAI-Trait score with a positive Z-score (0.46), strongly correlated with a higher CES-D score (0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is considerably lower than the population average, indicated by a negative Z-score (-1.01) for the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and this is negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem is associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant also reports low levels of happiness, with a Z-score of -1.61, which shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.46). Perceived stress is relatively high, with a Z-score of 0.92, and a positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D scores. Health satisfaction is also reported as low, with a Z-score of -1.2, and a negative correlation (-0.39).

Lifestyle behaviors for this participant are characterized by a lack of physical activity and sedentary habits. Notably, there is no reported engagement in exercising alone, exercising with others, or sports, with negative Z-scores indicating significantly lower frequencies than the population mean. The participant also engages in sedentary activities for substantial durations, including 1-2 hours of watching TV/videos/movies and 2-3 hours of internet usage and listening to music. Socializing with friends, reading, and other sedentary hobbies are reported at very low or non-existent frequencies. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, with generally negative Z-scores, indicating lower than average usage compared to the study population.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal an elevated resting heart rate (Mesor Z-score: 1.11, Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.84), suggesting a potentially higher baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a relatively regular daily pattern of heart rate variability, with moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.74) and relatively strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 1.4). However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.82), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows periods of significantly lower heart rate than expected during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -20.07 to -15.1), which could indicate prolonged periods of lower-than-average physiological activity during sleep or early waking. Conversely, there are periods of notably higher heart rate deviations during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 5-6 PM and 7-8 PM, with Z-scores of 1.06 and 1.02 respectively), suggesting elevated physiological arousal during these times. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score: -0.35), which is slightly below average, and a median sleep start time around midnight, with minimal deviation from this pattern.

Considering the constellation of self-reported psychological distress (high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, high perceived stress, low health satisfaction), coupled with sedentary lifestyle behaviors and notable patterns in physiological data suggesting disrupted sleep/wake cycles and potentially heightened arousal at certain times, the overall presentation suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D scores, and the positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D scores, along with the significant anxiety levels, are particularly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology.

87328,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with certain characteristics suggesting elevated distress and others indicating resilience. Self-report data reveal notably low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.81) and high self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: 1.66), which are protective factors against depressive symptoms. Conversely, high self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64) and a very high GPA (3.92 in Fall 2015, 3.89 in Spring 2016, 3.8 in Fall 2016) suggest strong academic functioning and positive subjective well-being. However, the participant also reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score (Z-score: 0.13), exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, and a lower-than-average satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2). Perceived stress levels are notably low (Stress Z-score: -1.8), which is typically associated with fewer depressive symptoms. The participant engages in moderate levels of sports (Z-score: 0.91) but spends considerable time on sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 2.54) and listening to music (Z-score: 1.6), and also reports very high levels of socialising with friends (Z-score: 2.53). Substance usage is reported as not at all across all categories.

Wearable data provides further insight into the participant's physiological and behavioral patterns. The interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm is at the population mean (Z-score: 1.0), suggesting a moderately regular daily pattern. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score: 1.78), indicating a wide range between peak and trough heart rates, which could reflect periods of heightened physiological arousal. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (5:40 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.45). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant elevations in heart rate during the evening hours, particularly between 6-7 PM (Z-score: 2.62) and 5-6 PM (Z-score: 1.23), and continuing into later evening hours (e.g., 9-10 PM Z-score: 1.08, 10-11 PM Z-score: 1.52). Conversely, very low heart rates are observed during the early morning hours (2-6 AM), indicating a clear diurnal pattern. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes, which is slightly above the population mean (Z-score: 0.3), with a standard deviation in sleep duration that is below average, suggesting relatively consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late (1:26 AM), with a standard deviation that indicates some variability in sleep onset. The mean daily naps are slightly elevated (Z-score: 1.21).

Considering the provided data, the participant exhibits a mixed profile with several indicators that might point towards a higher CES-D score, despite some protective factors. The disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), while not extremely high in its z-score, is a common correlate of depressive symptoms. More significantly, the high amplitude of the heart rate, coupled with pronounced evening elevations in heart rate, could suggest physiological dysregulation that is sometimes associated with increased stress and negative affect. The late sleep start time and some variability in sleep onset, alongside slightly elevated naps, may contribute to this. While high self-esteem and low anxiety are protective, they do not entirely negate the potential for depressive symptoms. The strong academic performance and high happiness scores are positive, but the data does not offer a direct CES-D score. However, given the presence of sleep disturbances and potential physiological arousal patterns, it is plausible this participant falls within the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

49497,49.0,1.0,"The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several indicators suggesting potential distress. Notably, a significantly elevated score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Z=2.24) suggests a high propensity for experiencing anxiety, which is strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (r=0.81). Conversely, a substantially low score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) (Z=-2.28) indicates low self-worth, also showing a negative correlation with CES-D scores (r=-0.70), implying lower self-esteem is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are moderately elevated (Z=0.65), with a positive correlation (r=0.28) to CES-D scores, suggesting that higher perceived stress is linked to more depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is lower than average (Z=-1.42), with a moderate negative correlation (r=-0.40) to CES-D scores, indicating that lower trust may be associated with increased depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is also below the population average (Z=-1.61), with a negative correlation (r=-0.45) to CES-D scores, suggesting lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Overall health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z=0.55), but with a negative correlation (r=-0.41) to CES-D scores, implying lower satisfaction with health is linked to higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral patterns reveal notable discrepancies. Sleep quality is identified as disturbed (PSQI score Z=1.05), with median sleep duration being shorter than average (Z=-0.85). Sleep timing is highly variable, as indicated by a significantly elevated standard deviation in sleep start time (Z=2.65). This marked irregularity in sleep patterns is a significant concern. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is at a higher frequency than the population average (Z=1.01 and Z=0.94 respectively), though their correlation with CES-D scores is negligible. Notably, recreational drug usage is exceptionally high relative to the population (Z=5.44), although its direct correlation with CES-D scores is also very low. Exercise frequency, particularly exercising alone (Z=1.07), is higher than average, while exercising with others is significantly lower (Z=-1.58). Daily recreational habits indicate substantial internet usage (Z=1.52) and listening to music for an hour or more (Z=0.21), which show moderate positive correlations with CES-D scores (r=0.24 and r=0.26 respectively). Conversely, socializing with friends is notably infrequent (Z=-1.41) with no correlation to CES-D scores. Screen time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is relatively low, and reading time is also minimal.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices indicates a less stable circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability of activity is significantly low (Z=-1.65), suggesting a lack of consistent daily routine. While intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z=0.60), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z=-1.03), these findings combined with the low interdaily stability point towards a poorly structured daily pattern of activity. The mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly above average (Z=0.23), and the resting heart rate is also slightly above average (Z=0.29). The amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm is significantly lower than average (Z=-1.56), suggesting reduced diurnal variation in heart rate, which can be indicative of a blunted physiological response. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:05 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals several periods of marked deviation. Notably, late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM) show the largest negative deviations from the mesor (Z=0.68, Z=0.84, Z=0.53 respectively), suggesting periods of significantly reduced physiological arousal during these times, which aligns with disrupted sleep. The late evening hours (9-10 PM) also show a significant negative deviation (Z=-1.92). Conversely, morning hours (8-9 AM, 9-10 AM) and late evening (10-11 PM) show positive deviations, indicating increased arousal relative to the mesor during these times.

Considering the constellation of findings, the participant exhibits significant markers associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The high anxiety, low self-esteem, elevated perceived stress, low happiness, and disturbed sleep patterns are all strongly indicative of a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The inconsistent sleep patterns, particularly the late start times and reduced duration, along with the low interdaily stability in activity, further suggest a lack of routine and potential disengagement, which are common in depression. While some behavioral factors like substance use and specific recreational habits have low correlations to CES-D, the overall picture painted by anxiety, self-esteem, stress, happiness, and sleep is compelling. Given the significant Z-scores for anxiety, self-esteem, and perceived stress, and their strong correlations with CES-D, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

33785,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful interpretation in the context of depressive symptomatology. Notably, elevated trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is a prominent feature, with a score of 56.0 and a Z-score of 1.45 placing them significantly above the study population mean. This high level of chronic anxiety is strongly correlated with CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting a substantial association with depressive symptomology. Conversely, self-esteem is at a near-average level, with a score of 32.0 and a Z-score of -0.87 indicating it is below the mean but not drastically so. The correlation with CES-D scores is moderately negative (-0.71), aligning with the expectation that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also below average (Z-score of -0.71), which, while generally a positive indicator, shows a slight positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.29), suggesting that even at lower levels, perceived stress might contribute to depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, is near the population average (Z-score of 0.13), classifying as ""Disturbed Sleep"" according to the provided threshold, and demonstrates a weak positive correlation with CES-D scores (not explicitly provided, but implied by the general context).

Behavioral patterns reveal a high engagement in sedentary activities. The participant spends a substantial amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64), playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score 2.47), and engaging in sedentary hobbies (2-3 hours, Z-score 2.01). These high-usage patterns for leisure activities are particularly pronounced in video gaming, which is significantly above the population average. Conversely, the participant's engagement in sports is very low (Not at all, Z-score -1.09). Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is also varied, with solitary exercise being high (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07) and exercise with others being infrequent (""1-2 times a month,"" Z-score -0.17). Substance usage is generally low, with beer consumption being moderate and wine/liquor consumption being less frequent.

Physiological data from the wearable device provides further insights into the participant's daily functioning. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively stable daily rhythm, evidenced by an Interdaily Stability value of 0.48 (Z-score 0.58) and a highly regular pattern of activity as reflected by a low Intradaily Variability of 0.25 (Z-score -2.08). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also moderately high (Value 0.45, Z-score 1.06). The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.39), and the Amplitude of daily heart rate variation is also elevated (Z-score 0.54). Resting heart rate is unremarkable (Z-score 0.07). The mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals a pattern of generally lower heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., -23.45 at 5-6 am, Z-score -0.74) which is more pronounced than the deviations during the evening and late night (e.g., 12.05 at 7-8 pm, Z-score 0.09; 14.02 at 10-11 pm, Z-score 1.19). Sleep duration is slightly above average (7 hours 20 minutes, Z-score 0.18), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration (110 minutes, Z-score 0.2). However, the sleep start time is relatively consistent, with a standard deviation of 49 minutes (Z-score -0.75), suggesting a somewhat regular sleep schedule.

Considering the totality of the data, several factors point towards a potentially elevated CES-D score. The high trait anxiety, which is strongly correlated with CES-D scores, is a significant indicator. While self-esteem is not critically low, it is below average, and the moderately negative correlation with CES-D scores suggests its contribution. The strong engagement in sedentary leisure activities, particularly video gaming, and the low engagement in sports, could also be indicative of reduced motivation or pleasure, common in depressive states. Although perceived stress and subjective sleep quality are not extremely poor, their presence and correlations warrant consideration. The physiological data, while showing some regularity in circadian rhythms, does not strongly mitigate the psychological indicators. The moderate positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D, combined with the strong positive correlation of trait anxiety with CES-D, suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms.

33009,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful consideration in the context of depressive symptomology. Self-report measures reveal a generally average to slightly elevated level of anxiety proneness, as indicated by a STAI score of 40.0, which falls within the typical range for trait anxiety. However, this is accompanied by a relatively high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (40.0), suggesting a robust sense of self-worth, which is typically inversely associated with depressive symptoms. This high self-esteem score exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71), implying that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the participant reports a moderate level of happiness (3.0 on a scale where higher is better) and a relatively low degree of perceived stress (19.0 on a scale where higher indicates more stress). These findings, particularly the high self-esteem and low perceived stress, would typically suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms.

The participant's subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 7.0, exceeding the common threshold of 5 for clinically significant sleep disturbance. While this indicates subjective sleep difficulties, it is important to note that the correlation with CES-D scores is not provided. Objectively, Fitbit data indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 54 minutes, which is slightly longer than average for the population (Z-score of 0.89), and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (55 minutes), suggesting consistency in sleep quantity. The median sleep start time is around 12:51 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in start time, indicating some variability in nightly sleep schedules. The low standard deviation in sleep duration, despite a disturbed subjective rating, might suggest that the issues lie more in the quality or continuity of sleep rather than its overall length.

Behavioral patterns reveal a moderate engagement in alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) but no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is moderate, with the participant exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, and participating in sports 1-2 times a month; these activities show weak negative correlations with CES-D scores. Daily recreational habits are characterized by limited time spent watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.62) and playing video games (not at all, Z-score -0.56). Conversely, internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18) and social interaction with friends is also in the 1-2 hour range (Z-score 0.16). Notably, the participant reports not listening to music (Z-score -1.19), which is an unusual pattern, and spending limited time on reading (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32) and sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.36). These limited engagement in passive leisure activities and the absence of music listening are potential indicators of reduced engagement or anhedonia, which can be associated with depressive symptoms.

Analysis of wearable-derived circadian rhythm and heart rate data reveals some notable patterns. The participant exhibits lower than average interdaily stability (Value: 0.35, Z-score: -0.49) and higher than average intradaily variability (Value: 0.62, Z-score: 0.53) in their heart rate, suggesting less regularity in daily activity patterns and more fluctuation within a day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also below average (Value: 0.27, Z-score: -0.45), further indicating a less structured circadian rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate) is below the population average (Value: 68.76, Z-score: -0.71), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also considerably lower than average (Value: 7.95, Z-score: -0.92), implying a reduced physiological dynamic range. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (3:51 PM). Examination of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, deviations around -14.02 to -14.75), followed by increasing positive deviations throughout the late morning and afternoon, peaking between 10-11 AM (11.38) and 1-2 PM (11.14). Notably, heart rate deviations are significantly lower than average in the late evening and night, particularly between 7-10 PM (deviations ranging from 0.25 to 5.72, with a Z-score of -1.38 at 9-10 PM). This prolonged period of reduced heart rate variation, especially during typical evening hours, coupled with the low amplitude and mesor, might suggest a blunted physiological arousal response or reduced overall activity levels.

Considering the available data, there are mixed indicators for the participant's CES-D score. On one hand, high self-esteem, relatively low perceived stress, and a moderate reported level of happiness suggest a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. However, the subjective report of disturbed sleep, coupled with objective measures indicating lower interdaily stability and intradaily variability in heart rate, and a blunted circadian rhythm with reduced amplitude and mesor, are potentially indicative of underlying issues that could contribute to depressive symptomatology. The limited engagement in certain recreational activities, particularly the absence of music listening, could also be a sign of reduced interest or pleasure, a core symptom of depression. The correlations provided are not consistently pointing towards either end of the spectrum. The strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D suggests that higher self-esteem is protective against depressive symptoms. Conversely, the weak positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D suggests that higher stress is associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Despite the presence of some protective factors like high self-esteem, the combination of disturbed subjective sleep, objectively less stable and variable circadian rhythm, a blunted physiological response, and a lack of engagement in potentially mood-enhancing activities like listening to music leans towards a more complex psychological state that may include elevated depressive symptoms. The objective markers of a disrupted or blunted circadian system are often associated with depression. Given the totality of the evidence, it is more likely that the participant's depressive symptom burden falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

96184,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile characterized by several noteworthy behavioral and physiological patterns. Self-report measures indicate a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.07), a tendency towards lower self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = 0.26, despite a score of 40.0 indicating high self-esteem), and a concern with perceived stress (Stress Z-score = 0.38). Notably, happiness levels are reported as below average (Happy Z-score = -0.53). Subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI Z-score = 0.13), with a significant disparity between objective and subjective sleep duration.

Objective sleep metrics reveal a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 27 minutes, which is considerably shorter than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = -2.16). This is further amplified by a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score = 5.88) and sleep start time (Z-score = 7.44), suggesting considerable sleep variability and inconsistency. The median sleep start time of 04:42 AM is exceptionally early and deviates substantially from typical sleep patterns. The presence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = 1.27) may reflect attempts to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

Wearable data regarding circadian rhythm regularity shows low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -1.79), indicating a poorly defined daily rhythm. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.39), suggesting fragmented activity patterns within the day. The mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is lower than the population average (Mesor Z-score = -1.0), with a similarly lower amplitude (Amplitude Z-score = -1.48). The resting heart rate is also on the lower side of the population distribution (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.32). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM with Z-scores of 1.33 and 1.16 respectively), which is atypical and occurs during the reported sleep start times, suggesting a possible disruption in physiological recovery during sleep. Conversely, there are several periods of elevated heart rate deviations during the daytime and early evening, particularly between 5-6 PM (Z-score = -0.22) and 10-11 PM (Z-score = 0.3), with notable deviations throughout the afternoon.

Behaviorally, the participant reports minimal engagement in substance usage and limited participation in exercise, whether alone or with others. Recreational activities are also largely absent, with no reported sports activities. The participant reports not watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games, and very limited time spent on reading or sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is moderate (31 minutes an hour), and listening to music is a more frequent activity (1-2 hours). Socializing with friends is reported at a very low frequency (16-30 minutes), which may be a contributing factor to perceived stress and lower happiness. The low GPA, while not indicative of clinical depression, suggests academic strain may be present. Health satisfaction is reported as average.

Considering the confluence of significantly disrupted sleep patterns, characterized by very short durations and high variability, alongside poor circadian rhythmicity and a tendency towards lower happiness, elevated stress, and lower self-esteem, these factors collectively point towards a considerable burden of depressive symptoms. The correlations provided, while varied, do not strongly override the impact of these pronounced objective and subjective indicators of distress. The combination of severe sleep disturbance and low circadian regularity is a robust predictor of elevated depressive symptomatology.

79395,32.0,0.9300518134715026,"This participant exhibits several self-reported psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant attention in the context of depressive symptomatology. The higher-than-average score on the STAI-Trait scale (Z-score: 1.25) indicates a proneness to chronic anxiety, which often co-occurs with depressive symptoms. This is further supported by a notably low self-esteem score (Z-score: -1.85), suggesting a negative self-perception. The participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score: -1.61) and health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.86), aligning with a potentially lower mood state. While perceived stress is within the average range (Z-score: -0.44), the combination of anxiety, low self-esteem, and reduced happiness suggests a profile consistent with heightened vulnerability to depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is also below average (Z-score: -1.1), which can be a contributing factor or consequence of depressive states, impacting social engagement and support.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate substance usage (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), which is not significantly outside the study population norms. Notably, the participant exercises with others more frequently than the average (Z-score: 1.23), a behavior that can be protective against depressive symptoms, though their overall exercise frequency alone is not particularly high. Daily recreation habits show a tendency towards passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64), with less engagement in reading (Z-score: -0.67) or video games (Z-score: -0.56). Socializing with friends is reported at an average time commitment. The participant also reports below-average sleep quality according to the PSQI (Z-score: -0.33), with a classification of ""Disturbed Sleep,"" which is a significant correlate of depressive symptoms.

The wearable data reveals mixed findings regarding physiological rhythmicity and sleep patterns. Interdaily stability of heart rate is higher than average (Z-score: 1.16), suggesting some regularity in daily activity patterns. However, intradaily variability is below average (Z-score: -0.53), which could indicate less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also above average (Z-score: 1.15), further supporting some degree of temporal regularity. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.23), and the resting heart rate is also slightly below average (Z-score: -0.17). The deviation of mean heart rate from the mesor shows distinct patterns throughout the day. Notably, there are significant deviations during the late evening and overnight hours, with the lowest deviations occurring between 2 AM and 6 AM, suggesting a period of reduced physiological arousal during these times. Evening hours (e.g., 10-11 PM) show elevated deviations from the mesor, which could be indicative of a disrupted sleep-wake cycle or stress-related physiological responses. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration that is close to the population average (Z-score: 0.09) with a slightly less variable duration (Z-score: -0.29). However, the median sleep start time is notably late (01:21:45), and the variability in sleep start time is below average (Z-score: -0.8), suggesting a consistent but delayed sleep onset. The presence of occasional daily naps is minimal.

Considering the CES-D population statistics, a mean score of 13.26 and a median of 11.0, the participant's profile leans towards elevated symptomatology. The significant indicators for this include high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and low self-reported happiness. The PSQI score also points to disturbed sleep, a common comorbidity with depression. While some behavioral aspects like social exercise are positive, the overall picture is dominated by psychological distress. The presence of late and consistently delayed sleep onset, coupled with below-average health satisfaction and trust, further reinforces the likelihood of a higher CES-D score.

59863,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"The participant exhibits several self-reported psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. A significantly low STAI-Trait score (Z = -1.71) indicates a low propensity for chronic anxiety, which is generally a positive indicator. Concurrently, a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z = 1.66) suggests robust self-worth. However, self-reported happiness is notably high (Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction is also elevated (Z = 1.3), which might appear counterintuitive in the presence of depressive symptoms. The Perceived Stress Scale score is within the average range (Z = -0.44), suggesting moderate appraisal of life stressors. Interpersonal trust is also in the upper half of the distribution (Z = 0.5). Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports moderate frequency of beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z = 1.01), no consumption of wine or liquor, and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are notable, with exercise occurring alone three or more times a week (Z = 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z = 0.53), along with participation in sports 1-2 times a week (Z = 0.91). Leisure activities include substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes/hour, Z = 0.64) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z = 0.67), with more moderate engagement in reading (16-30 minutes, Z = 1.3) and sedentary hobbies (16-30 minutes, Z = 0.23). Internet usage is moderate (31 minutes/hour, Z = -0.49). The PSQI score indicates good subjective sleep quality (Z = -0.8).

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data provide further insight. The participant's average heart rate during waking hours, represented by the Mesor, is significantly elevated compared to the study population (Z = 2.36), coupled with a higher resting heart rate (Z = 1.13). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also notably high (Z = 1.01), suggesting a wider range of physiological fluctuation throughout the day. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:23 PM). The mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor indicates that during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 5-6 AM), heart rates are consistently lower than the daily average, reflecting typical sleep-related physiological slowing. Conversely, during mid-morning and afternoon, heart rates tend to be higher than the average, aligning with periods of activity. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z = 0.42), suggesting some degree of regularity in daily patterns, while intradaily variability is below average (Z = -1.16), indicating less fluctuation within individual days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also above average (Z = 0.64), reinforcing the regularity of daily cycles. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z = 0.27). The variability in sleep duration (70 minutes, Z = -0.69) and sleep start time (73 minutes, Z = -0.21) are within typical ranges, and there are no reported naps (Z = -0.86). Notably, the correlations provided for many of these metrics with CES-D scores are generally weak and often negative, suggesting that higher values of these specific metrics are not strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in this dataset. For instance, high self-esteem and happiness correlate negatively with CES-D, as do exercise frequency and health satisfaction, which is consistent with the expected directionality of these relationships.

Considering the available evidence, the participant presents a complex profile. While self-reported high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, coupled with low anxiety and good subjective sleep quality, suggest a generally positive psychological state, several objective and self-reported behavioral factors hint at potential underlying vulnerabilities. The elevated Mesor and amplitude of heart rate, along with a higher resting heart rate, could indicate a sustained level of physiological arousal that, without further context, is difficult to definitively link to depression but warrants attention. The strong negative correlations between positive psychological indicators (self-esteem, happiness) and CES-D are encouraging for a lower CES-D score. Conversely, the weak correlations for many other metrics do not provide strong evidence for elevated depressive symptoms. Given the overall picture, particularly the high self-esteem and happiness, and the lack of strong negative correlations with CES-D, it is more likely that this participant falls into the lower half of the CES-D distribution.

22913,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"This participant presents with several self-reported characteristics that warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. Their STAI-Trait score of 34.0 is indicative of low chronic anxiety, with a z-score of -0.72 suggesting it is considerably lower than the study population mean. Similarly, self-esteem, measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is at 38.0, near the maximum score of 40, and with a z-score of -0.03, placing it very close to the population average, suggesting a healthy level of self-worth. Perceived stress, as measured by the PSS, is at 20.0 with a z-score of -0.44, indicating a level of stress below the population mean. Health satisfaction is reported at 4.33, with a z-score of 0.05, aligning closely with the population average. Subjective sleep quality, assessed via the PSQI, is reported as good (score of 5.0, z-score of -0.8), which is below the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, although this score is very close to the threshold. Overall happiness is reported at 3.0 with a z-score of -0.53, suggesting a slightly lower than average reported level of happiness. Interpersonal trust is also reported at a slightly below average level, with a score of 3.17 and a z-score of -0.14.

Analysis of behavioral habits reveals a pattern of moderate substance use, with both beer and wine/liquor consumption reported as 1-2 times a week, and z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively, indicating higher than average usage in this regard. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all,"" with negative z-scores indicating lower than average usage. Exercise frequency is notably low, with ""Exercised Alone"" and ""Exercised with Others"" both reported as 1-2 times a month (z-scores of -0.43 and -0.17), and ""Sports"" as ""Not at all"" (z-score of -1.09), all suggesting below average engagement. Daily recreational habits show a mixed pattern: low time spent on watching TV/Videos/Movies (15 minutes or less, z-score -0.62) and video games (15 minutes or less, z-score 0.2), but higher internet usage (16-30 minutes, z-score -1.16) and sedentary hobbies (31 minutes an hour, z-score 0.82). Time spent listening to music is reported as ""Do not do"" (z-score -1.19), and socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes an hour (z-score -0.62). Reading is also reported as ""Do not do"" (z-score -0.67). The correlations with CES-D are generally low and mostly negative for positive traits like self-esteem and happiness, and slightly positive for stress, though none are particularly strong.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a mesor heart rate of 87.24, which is significantly higher than the population average (z-score 1.81). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also elevated at 13.38 (z-score 0.84). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 4:49 PM. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is average (z-score 0.0), suggesting a consistent daily pattern. However, intraday variability is notably low at 0.29 (z-score -1.8), indicating a relatively flat heart rate profile throughout the day, which could suggest reduced physiological reactivity. The resting heart rate is 64.6 bpm, with a z-score of 0.77, suggesting it is higher than the population average. Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -17.67 at 4-5 AM, z-score 0.07; -16.83 at 5-6 AM, z-score 0.22). Conversely, higher-than-average heart rates are observed during midday and afternoon (e.g., 14.43 at 1-2 PM, z-score 1.02; 12.09 at 6-7 PM, z-score -0.07; 12.0 at 9-10 PM, z-score 0.69). Sleep statistics indicate a considerably longer than average median sleep duration of 8 hours and 37 minutes (z-score 1.79), with average variability in sleep start time. There is also a slightly higher than average frequency of napping. The low intraday variability in heart rate, coupled with a higher mesor and resting heart rate, could suggest a chronically elevated physiological baseline, though the sleep duration is robust. The negative correlations with CES-D for traits like self-esteem and happiness, and a positive correlation with stress, while not strongly indicative on their own, align with the general expectation of lower CES-D scores correlating with positive traits and higher CES-D scores with negative traits.

Considering the participant's CES-D population statistics, the 50th percentile is 11.5. This participant's reported self-esteem, low anxiety, and good subjective sleep quality are generally associated with lower depressive symptomatology. However, the higher than average mesor and resting heart rate, coupled with low intraday variability, could reflect physiological strain. The low exercise frequency and higher internet and sedentary hobby usage also do not strongly support a lower CES-D score. While many self-report measures are favorable, the absence of robust positive indicators for mood and engagement in activities known to buffer depression, combined with potentially concerning physiological markers and sedentary habits, suggests a risk for moderate depressive symptoms. The correlations, while not definitively pointing to a high CES-D score, do show directionality consistent with elevated symptoms in some areas (e.g., positive correlation with stress, negative with happiness and self-esteem). Without a direct CES-D score, inferring placement within the top or bottom 50% is challenging. However, the presence of several less than ideal behavioral patterns (low exercise, higher sedentary activities, higher substance use) and some physiological indicators (elevated mesor and resting HR, low variability) alongside a neutral to slightly negative mood report (happiness) suggests that the participant might not fall squarely into the ""bottom 50%"" which typically represents low or average symptomatology. The combination of a longer sleep duration and lower intraday variability in heart rate, while not definitively pathological, does not strongly counter potential underlying distress. Given the available data, it is more plausible that the participant's overall profile leans towards the higher end of the CES-D distribution rather than the lower end.

48969,42.0,0.9896373056994818,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted profile characterized by elevated anxiety, diminished self-esteem, and significant sleep disturbances. Self-reported data indicates a high level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.75), coupled with notably low self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score = -2.28). The participant also reports significant sleep difficulties, as evidenced by a high PSQI score (Z-score = 2.9), suggesting a clinically significant disturbance in sleep quality and related issues. Happiness levels are reported as lower than average (Happy Z-score = -1.61). While perceived stress is within the population average (Stress Z-score = 0.1), the combination of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and poor sleep quality points towards psychological distress.

Behavioral patterns reveal an inclination towards sedentary activities and limited social engagement. The participant spends substantial amounts of time on activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 3.17), playing video games (Z-score = 4.74), internet usage (Z-score = 2.19), and listening to music (Z-score = 2.06), all of which are significantly higher than the population average. Conversely, social interaction with friends is minimal (Z-score = -2.2). Physical activity is moderate, with regular exercise alone (Frequency = Three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07), but a lack of exercise with others (Frequency = Not at all, Z-score = -1.58) and infrequent participation in sports. Substance usage is minimal across all categories.

Physiological data from wearable devices indicates a generally regular circadian rhythm, with high interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.08) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.32), suggesting a predictable daily physiological pattern. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated compared to the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = 1.24). The mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is also higher than average (Mesor Z-score = 0.79). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM to 5-6 AM show negative deviations with Z-scores ranging from 0.62 to 0.93), which is typical during sleep. However, there are notable peaks in heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM to 6-7 PM show positive deviations with Z-scores of 0.47 and 0.32 respectively), potentially reflecting periods of higher physiological arousal or activity. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 5:06 PM. Sleep duration is slightly longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = 0.84), but its variability is within the population range.

79731,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"The participant exhibits a profile characterized by elevated anxiety and diminished self-esteem, alongside notable sleep disturbances. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait score is significantly elevated (Z = 1.85), indicating a disposition towards chronic anxiety. This is coupled with a notably low score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z = -1.29), suggesting a lack of self-worth. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), is also significantly disturbed (Z = 1.98), exceeding the common threshold for clinical concern and indicating poor sleep quality and related difficulties over the past month. Objective sleep data from the wearable device reveals a substantially higher than average median sleep duration (Z = 1.37) and a considerable standard deviation in sleep duration (Z = 1.73), suggesting irregularity in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is also notably late (02:58 AM) with a relatively low standard deviation in start time (Z = -0.66), implying a consistent but late sleep schedule. Furthermore, there is a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Z = 1.34).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is elevated (Z = 1.55). The analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly blunted cardiovascular activity during typical waking hours, particularly in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, Z = -1.54; 1-2 PM, Z = -0.92). Conversely, there are periods of increased deviation during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z = 1.61; 4-5 AM, Z = 1.78), suggesting an atypical diurnal rhythm in physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates moderate interdaily stability (Z = -0.57), suggesting some regularity in the daily pattern of heart rate, but a higher than average intradaily variability (Z = 0.67), indicating more fluctuations within a 24-hour period. The mesor itself is elevated (Z = 0.81), reflecting a higher average heart rate across the day. The acrophase, representing the peak time of heart rate activity, is observed at 6:27 PM.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in above-average internet usage (Z = 0.85) and listening to music (Z = 1.6), and moderate levels of watching TV/videos/movies (Z = 0.64). Notably, there is a complete absence of organized exercise, including exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93), which is significantly lower than the study population. While substance use (beer and wine/liquor) is within the average range, the participant reports no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level (Z = 0.16). Perceived stress levels are slightly above average (Z = 0.38), and health satisfaction is notably low (Z = -1.53). Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z = 0.55), though this may be influenced by the significantly elevated anxiety and low self-esteem.

The participant's data suggests a pattern consistent with elevated depressive symptomology. The significant anxiety (STAI Z=1.85) and low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z=-1.29) are strongly associated with higher CES-D scores (correlations of 0.81 and -0.71 respectively). The disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z=1.98) and irregular sleep duration (Sleep Duration SD Z=1.73) also correlate with depressive symptoms. The physiological data indicates an atypical diurnal heart rate pattern with heightened arousal during early morning hours and blunted activity during the day, which can be indicative of disrupted circadian rhythms often seen in depression. The lack of physical activity (Exercised Alone Z=-1.93, Exercised with Others Z=-1.58, Sports Z=-1.09) is a significant behavioral correlate of depression. While some metrics like happiness and trust are not strongly indicative of elevated depression, the convergence of anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, and behavioral disengagement strongly suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms. Given these strong indicators, it is likely the participant's CES-D score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

Notably, internet usage and socializing with friends are also within the lower time brackets. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.78).

Wearable data reveals a somewhat irregular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability Z-score (1.41) and a slightly lower than average Intradaily Variability Z-score (-0.25), suggesting a consistent daily pattern but perhaps less variation within the day. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 1.32) further supports daily rhythmicity. The Mesor (mean heart rate adjusted for circadian rhythm) is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.34), indicating a generally elevated baseline heart rate. The Amplitude, reflecting the extent of daily heart rate variation, is markedly high (Z-score: 2.7), suggesting substantial fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:23 PM. Analysis of Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor reveals significant dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score: -2.27, 3-4 AM Z-score: -2.57, 4-5 AM Z-score: -2.68), consistent with sleep. Post-wake-up hours show a return to near-mesor levels and then an increase, with notable positive deviations in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM Z-score: 2.14, 7-8 PM Z-score: 1.26, 8-9 PM Z-score: 0.81).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes, which is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.4). The standard deviation of sleep duration is also lower than average (Z-score: -1.33), suggesting consistent sleep duration on a nightly basis. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:07 AM, with a standard deviation of 50 minutes, indicating moderate consistency in sleep onset. There are no recorded naps. The Resting Heart Rate is below the population average (Z-score: -0.99).

Considering the overall pattern, the participant reports high levels of happiness and low perceived stress, coupled with good subjective sleep quality and low anxiety. These self-report measures, particularly happiness and stress, tend to correlate negatively with depressive symptoms. The high amplitude of heart rate variation and the consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule could suggest a generally active physiological state. However, the slightly below-average sleep duration, while consistent, might be a point of consideration. The self-reported high happiness and low stress are strong indicators against elevated depressive symptoms. The negative correlation between self-reported happiness and CES-D score (r = -0.46) and the positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D score (r = 0.28), though not overly strong, align with the expectation that high happiness and low stress are associated with lower depressive symptom burden. The robust self-reported positive psychological state, despite a slightly reduced sleep duration, suggests a lower likelihood of significant depressive symptomatology.

Perceived stress is at a moderate level (Stress Z-score: 0.65), with a positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.28). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.59), which aligns with Fitbit-derived sleep duration data, showing a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 44 minutes (Sleep Duration Z-score: -1.81), placing the participant in the lower end of sleep duration distribution and showing a weak negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.01). Sleep start times are also significantly variable, with a median start time of 01:11:30 and a standard deviation of 32 minutes (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.12), suggesting irregular sleep-wake patterns.

In terms of activity and daily routines, the participant reports exercising alone not at all (Exercised Alone Frequency Z-score: -1.93), but engages in exercise with others and sports at lower frequencies than the population. Daily recreational activities are largely characterized by low engagement, with minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, listening to music, and sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is reported as 1-2 hours, aligning closely with the population average. These limited engagement patterns in leisure activities may indirectly reflect reduced motivation or pleasure, common in depressive states, though the correlations with CES-D scores for most specific activities are negligible.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate circadian rhythm analysis reveals a notably low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.33), suggesting a potentially lower basal physiological arousal. The MESOR (mean heart rate over 24 hours) is also lower than the population average (Mesor Z-score: -0.65). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is higher than average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.91), indicating a greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs around 4:14 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show significant troughs during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: -2.02, 4-5 AM Z-score: -1.97, 5-6 AM Z-score: -1.97), which could reflect periods of low physiological activity during typical sleep hours. Conversely, there are elevated deviations during late morning and evening hours, such as 9-10 AM (Z-score: 2.05) and 10-11 PM (Z-score: 1.16). The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 1.16), indicating poor regularity in daily physiological patterns, while intradaily variability is moderate (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.46). The weak correlations of these wearable metrics with CES-D scores do not provide strong direct evidence of their impact on depressive symptoms within this dataset.

Based on the available data, the participant exhibits several indicators that align with elevated depressive symptomatology. The significantly reduced sleep duration and irregular sleep patterns, coupled with low engagement in many recreational activities, suggest potential anhedonia and impaired diurnal functioning. While self-reported anxiety is low and self-esteem is moderate, perceived stress is elevated. The physiological data, particularly the low interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm and the pronounced deviations during sleep hours, suggest dysregulation in daily biological processes that can be associated with depression. Considering these factors, particularly the sleep disturbances and potential lack of engagement, it is plausible that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the upper half of the study population's CES-D score distribution.

Conversely, self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.03), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, indicating that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are elevated (Z-score = 0.38) with a modest positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D, suggesting that higher perceived stress is linked to greater depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is notably lower than the population average (Z-score = -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D, implying that lower health satisfaction might be associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score = 0.55) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, suggesting that while self-reported happiness is relatively high, it still correlates with lower CES-D scores.

The participant's lifestyle behaviors reveal a pattern of minimal engagement in several areas. Substance usage is low, with no reported use of wine/liquor or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, and infrequent beer consumption (Z-score for beer = -0.41). Exercise frequency is also low, with infrequent participation in exercising alone or with others (Z-scores -1.18 and -0.88 respectively), though sports participation is at a higher frequency (Z-score = 0.91). Daily recreational habits are characterized by limited engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games (Z-scores -1.25 and -0.56 respectively), and very limited internet usage (Z-score = -1.16) and listening to music (Z-score = -1.19). Socializing with friends is also at a very low reported frequency (Z-score = -1.41). The limited engagement in active and social recreational activities, despite reporting above-average happiness, may warrant further consideration in the context of depressive symptom evaluation.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as evidenced by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 1.0) and a strong Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 2.49). However, Intradaily Variability is lower than average (Z-score = -1.31), suggesting a less dynamic heart rate fluctuation throughout the day. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is elevated compared to the population average (Z-score = 0.62), and the Resting Heart Rate is also higher (Z-score = 0.36). The participant's average heart rate during sleep-related hours (e.g., 1-5 AM) shows negative deviations from the mesor, with the largest deviations occurring between 2-5 AM (e.g., -20.92 at 4-5 AM), suggesting a period of reduced cardiovascular activity during these times. Conversely, during waking hours, particularly the mid-morning and afternoon (e.g., 8-9 AM shows a positive deviation of 6.17), heart rate activity is elevated relative to the mesor. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 51 minutes, which is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.41). The sleep start time is also later than average (median 00:47:30), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score = -0.55), suggesting some variability in sleep onset. The Z-score for PSQI of -0.33, indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" and a score above 5 commonly indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance, contrasts with the objective sleep duration metrics.

Considering the provided data and its correlation with the CES-D population parameters, the participant's profile suggests a CES-D score likely falling within the top 50% of the distribution. While some self-report measures like happiness and self-esteem are in the average to above-average range, these are counterbalanced by elevated perceived stress, lower health satisfaction, and lower interpersonal trust, all of which show a positive correlation with CES-D. The notable PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep further supports potential elevation in depressive symptomatology, as sleep disturbances are a hallmark of depression. Although objective sleep duration is not severely impaired, subjective sleep quality and regularity may be compromised. The high autocorrelation at 24 hours and high interdaily stability might suggest a more rigid or less responsive circadian system which can be indicative of mood disturbances. The combination of these factors, particularly the elevated perceived stress and disturbed sleep, alongside the positive correlations with CES-D, suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

82986,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"This participant exhibits several indicators that may be relevant to understanding their psychological state and potential depressive symptomatology. Their self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score of 1.64), correlating negatively with their CES-D score, suggesting that higher happiness is associated with lower depressive symptoms. This is further supported by a significantly low STAI-Trait anxiety score (Z-score of -1.61), indicating a stable disposition of low anxiety. In contrast, their self-esteem is elevated (Z-score of 1.66), also correlating negatively with CES-D scores, reinforcing the protective effect of positive self-regard. Interpersonal trust is also high (Z-score of 1.79) with a negative correlation to CES-D, implying greater trust is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is moderately positive (Z-score of 0.8), with a negative correlation to CES-D, suggesting good perceived health is linked to lower depression scores. Perceived stress is within the normative range (Z-score of -0.71), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D, indicating that slightly lower perceived stress might be associated with fewer depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and minimal engagement in sports or exercising with others. They exercise alone 1-2 times a week, which is slightly above average for the population (Z-score of 0.32). Their sedentary habits are characterized by minimal engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos, video games, or listening to music, and no reported reading or other sedentary hobbies. They report 31 minutes of internet usage per hour and socialize with friends for 1-2 hours daily, which is within the average range (Z-score of 0.16). These behavioral patterns, particularly the lack of substance use and moderate exercise, do not strongly suggest behaviors typically associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

Physiologically, the participant's sleep duration is significantly reduced, with a median of 5 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score of -2.6). This is a strong indicator of potential sleep disturbance, which often co-occurs with and can exacerbate depressive symptoms. While subjective sleep quality measured by PSQI is within the normal range for clinical significance (score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.33, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""), the objective, very short sleep duration is a more pronounced finding. The mesor of their heart rate, representing the overall average, is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.79), and their resting heart rate is also higher than average (Z-score of 1.03), suggesting increased physiological arousal. The amplitude of their circadian rhythm is lower than average (Z-score of -1.04), indicating a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate activity, is reported as 4:37 PM. The hourly deviation from the mesor indicates a pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, with significant negative deviations), and higher heart rates during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 7-9 AM and 12-1 PM), which generally align with typical daily activity patterns but show some deviation from the mesor. Circadian rhythm stability metrics show moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.46) and lower interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.66), suggesting some inconsistency in the daily rhythmicity of their heart rate.

Considering the totality of the data, the significantly short sleep duration is a primary concern and a strong indicator that may contribute to elevated depressive symptomatology. While the participant reports high levels of happiness, self-esteem, trust, and satisfaction with health, and does not engage in maladaptive behaviors like substance abuse, the objective sleep deficit is a substantial physiological challenge that is often linked to poorer mental health outcomes. The PSQI score, while not extremely high, does flag disturbed sleep. The elevated resting heart rate and lower amplitude in circadian rhythm might also reflect underlying physiological stress or dysregulation. The negative correlations between several positive self-report measures (happiness, self-esteem, trust, health satisfaction) and CES-D scores suggest that these protective factors are indeed associated with lower depression. However, the profound sleep deprivation, as evidenced by the very low Z-score for median sleep duration, is a significant factor that would likely push this participant towards the higher end of the CES-D distribution, as sleep disturbances are a core component of depressive symptomatology.

11402,17.0,0.727979274611399,"The participant exhibits elevated levels of anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of 1.25 on the STAI, suggesting a disposition towards chronic anxiety. This is further corroborated by a moderate correlation of 0.81 between STAI scores and CES-D, implying that higher trait anxiety is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score of 0.26), with a negative correlation of -0.71 to CES-D, indicating that higher self-esteem is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.17) with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Interpersonal trust is moderately high (Z-score of 1.15) and shows a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) with CES-D. Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, suggesting that lower happiness is associated with more depressive symptoms. Overall health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D. Substance use, specifically beer consumption, is at a higher than average frequency (Z-score of 1.01), though it shows a negligible correlation with CES-D (-0.05). Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is moderate (Z-scores of 0.32 and 0.53 respectively), with weak negative correlations to CES-D. Participation in sports is notably low (Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational habits show a significant engagement in video games (Z-score of 2.47) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 1.28), with moderate positive correlations to CES-D for both (0.07 and 0.13 respectively), suggesting that higher engagement in these activities might be associated with more depressive symptoms. Internet usage is also above average (Z-score of 0.85).

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 19 minutes, which is below average (Z-score of -1.07), and a notable positive correlation (0.2) with CES-D, suggesting that shorter sleep durations are linked to increased depressive symptoms. The variability in sleep duration is above average (Z-score of 0.8). Sleep start times are highly variable, with a median start time in the early morning (03:17:50) and a significant standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score of 1.14), showing a positive correlation (0.22) with CES-D, indicating irregular sleep schedules are associated with higher depressive symptoms. The average number of daily naps is also higher than average (Z-score of 1.21) with a positive correlation (0.21) to CES-D.

Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a higher than average Mesor (mean heart rate during the day) at 83.48 bpm (Z-score of 1.3), with a positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D, suggesting a higher resting heart rate is associated with more depressive symptoms. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.4). Intradaily variability in heart rate is low (Z-score of -1.45) with a weak negative correlation (-0.05) to CES-D, suggesting a relatively stable, though low, daily variation in heart rate. Interdaily stability is also below average (Z-score of -0.33), indicating less consistency in daily patterns. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score of -1.03), suggesting a reduced adherence to a 24-hour cycle. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is observed in the evening (6:58 PM). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals elevated heart rates during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: Z=1.1, 1-2 AM: Z=1.77, 2-3 AM: Z=1.38), particularly during the hours typically associated with sleep. These elevated deviations are positively correlated with CES-D, with correlations ranging from 0.08 to 0.16. Conversely, heart rate deviations are notably lower during typical waking hours, especially mid-morning (e.g., 6-7 AM: Z=-20.56, 7-8 AM: Z=-15.81, 8-9 AM: Z=-16.88). The acrophase of 6:58 PM indicates a late peak in the heart rate rhythm, which, coupled with elevated heart rates during typical sleep hours, suggests a disrupted circadian pattern that may be contributing to depressive symptoms.

Considering the elevated anxiety, below-average self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, significant engagement in sedentary recreational activities like video games and watching TV, and particularly the disturbed sleep patterns (short duration, irregular timing, elevated heart rate during sleep hours) and disrupted circadian rhythm indicators, there is substantial evidence suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The positive correlations between these factors and CES-D further support this interpretation. The PSQI score of 5.0, while not exceeding the commonly cited threshold for clinically significant disturbance on its own, in conjunction with the other metrics, points towards a constellation of issues associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant's GPA is also on the lower end of average. While interpersonal trust is higher, and perceived stress is not excessively high, these factors do not outweigh the cumulative evidence.

38610,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant exhibits several self-reported characteristics that warrant attention in the context of depressive symptomatology. While their STAI-Trait anxiety score is within a non-anxious range (Z-score: -1.31), their self-esteem is notably low, with a score significantly above the population mean (Z-score: 1.66), indicating a positive deviation from the expected range for higher self-esteem. This is further compounded by a low self-reported happiness score (Z-score: 1.64). Perceived stress levels are slightly elevated compared to the population average (Z-score: 0.38), and health satisfaction is also moderately lower than the population norm (Z-score: 1.13). Substance usage, including beer, wine, and liquor, is reported as less than 1-2 times a month, and recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all, which are generally low levels of usage. Exercise patterns include exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.23), but exercising alone is less frequent (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.32), and participation in sports is notably absent (Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits show limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -1.25) and video games (Z-score: -0.56), with moderate internet usage (Z-score: -0.49) and listening to music (Z-score: -0.26). Socializing with friends is infrequent (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.41), and reading and sedentary hobbies are also not extensively engaged in.

Analysis of wearable data reveals significant disturbances in sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is considerably shorter than the population average, falling at 5 hours and 46 minutes with a Z-score of -1.76, indicating a substantial deficit. The median sleep start time is very late, occurring at 02:39:15, with a standard deviation of 54 minutes, suggesting irregularity in sleep onset. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate disruptions in regularity, with Interdaily Stability at 0.37 (Z-score: -0.33) and Intradaily Variability at 0.59 (Z-score: 0.32), suggesting a less stable daily rhythm. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is elevated (Z-score: 1.14), but the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is reduced (Z-score: -1.15), suggesting a flattened daily variation in heart rate. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, is observed late in the day at 5:32 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate data demonstrates a pattern of significant negative deviations from the Mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -13.21, 4-5 AM: -14.76, 5-6 AM: -16.59), followed by positive deviations during the morning and early afternoon, which may reflect a delayed or disrupted diurnal activity pattern.

Holistically, the participant presents with a constellation of factors suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. The low self-esteem, low reported happiness, and moderate perceived stress, coupled with the significantly disturbed and shortened sleep duration and late, irregular sleep start times, are all core indicators associated with depression. While the participant engages in some forms of exercise, their limited social interaction and infrequent engagement in sedentary hobbies or reading might contribute to a lack of fulfilling activities. The reduced amplitude in heart rate variability and the substantial negative deviations during typical sleep hours further point to physiological dysregulation that often accompanies depression. Considering the magnitude of these indicators, particularly the sleep disturbances and negative self-perception, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

96610,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"This participant presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral metrics, requiring a multimodal analysis to interpret their potential depressive symptom burden.

**Self-Reported Psychological and Behavioral Patterns:**

The participant reports notably low levels of anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of -1.61 on the STAI-Trait scale, classifying them as ""not anxious."" This is further supported by a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z-Score: 1.66), suggesting strong self-worth. However, the interpretation of the Self-Esteem score is inconsistent with the scale range (10-40), as a score of 50 is exceptionally high and likely an error in data entry or interpretation; assuming the Z-score is accurate, it still points to high self-esteem. Subjective well-being appears somewhat diminished, with a Z-score of 1.64 on the ""Happy"" scale indicating higher self-reported happiness, which is contrary to the negative correlation with CES-D. Conversely, health satisfaction is relatively low (Z-score: 2.05), and interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Z-score: 0.83). Perceived stress levels are close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.17), suggesting a moderate appraisal of life stressors.

**Sleep and Lifestyle Habits:**

Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Z-score: 0.59), with a score of 8.0, exceeding the common threshold of 5 for clinically significant disturbance. This subjective report is juxtaposed with objectively measured sleep duration. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 53 minutes (Z-score: -0.37), which is slightly below the population average, and the standard deviation of sleep duration is close to the mean (Z-score: -0.1). Sleep onset exhibits significant variability, with a median start time of 01:21:29 and a standard deviation of 48 minutes (Z-score: -0.77), indicating irregular sleep timing. Napping frequency is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.44). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, with Z-scores indicating this is well below the population average. Exercise patterns are mixed; participation in sports is notably high (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z-Score: 0.91), while exercising alone is infrequent (Frequency: 'Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-Score: -1.18). Engagement in sedentary leisure activities is generally low, with ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" ""Video Games,"" ""Internet Usage,"" ""Listening to Music,"" ""Socializing with Friends,"" ""Reading,"" and ""Sedentary Hobby"" all reporting low to moderate time commitments, many of which are below population averages.

**Wearable-Derived Physiological and Circadian Metrics:**

The participant exhibits a robust and regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.83) and a mesor (average heart rate over the day) that is significantly elevated above the population mean (Z-score: 0.92). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also high (Z-score: 1.03), suggesting a pronounced diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:20 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.32).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. During nighttime hours (1 AM to 7 AM), heart rate consistently deviates negatively from the mesor, indicating lower than average physiological arousal. This is particularly pronounced between 2 AM and 6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.59 to -1.19. Conversely, during daylight hours, particularly from 8 AM to 4 PM, heart rate deviations are predominantly positive, signifying higher physiological arousal. Notable peaks in positive deviation occur between 2 PM and 4 PM (Z-scores of 1.42 and 1.35, respectively), aligning with the acrophase. Evening hours show a gradual decrease in positive deviations, returning to near-mesor levels by late evening.

**Correlation with CES-D Score:**

The provided correlations offer guidance for interpreting the relationship between these metrics and CES-D scores. Negative correlations with metrics like STAI-Trait (0.81), Self-Esteem (-0.71), Health Satisfaction (-0.39), and Happy (-0.46) suggest that higher scores in these areas are associated with lower CES-D scores. This indicates that lower anxiety, higher self-esteem, greater health satisfaction, and greater happiness are protective factors against depressive symptomatology. Conversely, a positive correlation with Perceived Stress (0.28) suggests that higher perceived stress is associated with elevated CES-D scores. For wearable metrics, a positive correlation with Mesor (0.2) and Amplitude ( -0.1) suggests that higher average heart rate and greater diurnal variability might be linked to higher CES-D. However, most other correlations with wearable metrics and sleep statistics are close to zero, suggesting weaker linear associations.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding depressive symptomatology. On one hand, they report very low anxiety, high self-esteem (despite potential data anomaly), and do not engage in substance use or report significant sedentary leisure time activities, which are generally associated with lower CES-D scores. Their circadian rhythm is robust and well-defined, with high stability and amplitude, and their heart rate exhibits typical diurnal patterns of arousal, with peaks during the day and troughs at night, which are generally considered healthy.

However, several indicators suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptoms. The PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep quality, and the median sleep duration is slightly below average with significant variability in sleep onset times. While low anxiety and high self-esteem are protective, lower health satisfaction and potentially lower happiness (despite the positive wording of the ""Happy"" metric and its negative correlation with CES-D) could be contributing factors. The positive correlation between Mesor and CES-D, along with a slightly elevated resting heart rate and significant negative deviations during sleep hours, might suggest physiological dysregulation that can be associated with depression. Furthermore, the participant's relatively low GPA could also be an indirect indicator of underlying difficulties. The negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with CES-D are quite strong, indicating that even if self-esteem is high, a dip in happiness and health satisfaction could contribute to higher CES-D. The strong negative correlation with STAI-Trait (0.81) suggests that the absence of anxiety is a very strong protective factor, potentially counteracting other negative indicators. However, given the disturbed sleep and the potential for lower happiness and health satisfaction, coupled with a moderate GPA, the balance of evidence leans towards a CES-D score that is not significantly in the lowest range. The presence of disturbed sleep, a factor often comorbid with depression, is a notable concern. Considering the distribution of CES-D scores in the population (25th percentile at 6.0, 50th percentile at 11.5, 75th percentile at 18.0), the indicators point towards a score that is likely above the median, especially given the PSQI score and the negative correlations with health satisfaction and happiness.

77711,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"This participant presents a complex profile with notable psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful interpretation in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures indicate elevated anxiety proneness, with a STAI score of 52.0 (Z=1.06), suggesting a disposition towards experiencing anxiety. This is coupled with lower-than-average self-esteem, indicated by a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 28.0 (Z=-1.43), which is inversely correlated with depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also somewhat elevated, with a PSS score of 17.0 (Z=-1.26), and a positive correlation with CES-D scores, suggesting that higher perceived stress may be associated with greater depressive symptomatology. Conversely, the participant reports moderate interpersonal trust (Z=-0.78) and average happiness (Z=0.55), with negative correlations to CES-D for both, implying that higher trust and happiness may be protective factors. Health satisfaction is also below average (Z=-0.62).

Behavioral habits reveal a participant who engages in moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a month for beer and wine/liquor), abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs, and exercises with moderate frequency (1-2 times a week, both alone and with others). However, engagement in sports is infrequent. Daily recreation reveals a significant amount of time spent listening to music (3-4 hours, Z=1.6), and a high amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28). Time spent on video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies are either non-existent or at lower durations compared to the population. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, a duration that is close to the population average (Z=0.16).

Wearable data indicates a circadian rhythm characterized by a lower-than-average Mesor (68.84, Z=-0.7) and resting heart rate (52.4, Z=-0.68), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal level. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also near average (10.52, Z=-0.08). The acrophase, the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is observed at 3:28 PM. Interdaily stability (0.34, Z=-0.57) and intradaily variability (0.51, Z=-0.25) are both below average, suggesting a less structured and potentially more fragmented daily activity pattern. Notably, the mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals significant dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM to 5-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.17 to -0.25), indicating periods of considerably lower cardiovascular activity during typical sleep or rest periods. Conversely, there are pronounced peaks in heart rate deviation during midday and early afternoon hours (e.g., 11 AM - 12 PM, 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM, with Z-scores ranging from 1.25 to 1.65), suggesting increased physiological arousal during these times.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes (Z=-0.33), which is slightly below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also lower than average (70 minutes, Z=-0.7), suggesting more consistent sleep duration, but this consistency might be at a suboptimal level. The median sleep start time is at 1:02:30 AM (Z=-0.62), indicating a delayed sleep onset. The standard deviation of sleep start time is also lower than average (55 minutes, Z=-0.22), suggesting more regular, though delayed, sleep timing. There are no reported daily naps.

Considering the overall pattern, the elevated anxiety and lower self-esteem, combined with moderate perceived stress and slightly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 7.0), are all indicative of potential depressive symptomatology. While the participant engages in some physical activity and social interaction, the significant time spent on passive entertainment like watching TV and listening to music, coupled with lower interdaily stability, could suggest reduced engagement in more rewarding activities. The physiological data shows a generally lower resting heart rate and Mesor, which can sometimes be associated with reduced energy levels and motivation common in depression. The pronounced heart rate reductions during the night and increases during the day, while having a consistent pattern, could reflect dysregulated circadian functioning. The slightly shorter and later sleep, along with the moderate PSQI score, further points towards sleep disturbances that often co-occur with and exacerbate depressive symptoms. The presence of multiple risk factors (anxiety, low self-esteem, stress, less structured daily rhythm, sleep issues) and limited evidence of strong protective factors suggest that this participant likely falls within the higher range of depressive symptom burden within the study population.

Self-report measures reveal moderate levels of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.13), with a notably high score for perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 0.65), indicating that situational appraisals are frequently perceived as demanding. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range for the population (RSES Z-score: 0.26), and interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Trust Z-score: -0.14). Subjective well-being, as measured by happiness, is lower than the population average (Happy Z-score: -0.53), and overall health satisfaction is also significantly lower (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.78).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer Z-score: 0.3) but abstains from wine/liquor and recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are below average, with infrequent exercise participation both alone (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.18) and with others (Exercised with Others Z-score: -0.17), and infrequent engagement in sports (Sports Z-score: 0.25). Daily recreation habits indicate a significant amount of internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score: 0.85), with moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Watching TV/Videos/Movies Z-score: 0.01). Time spent on sedentary hobbies is minimal (Sedentary Hobby Z-score: -0.36), as is time spent socializing with friends (Socializing with Friends Z-score: -1.41), suggesting a potential reduction in social engagement.

Wearable data provides further insights into the participant's physiological and behavioral regularity. The participant exhibits lower than average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.18) and a significantly lower Mesor (Mesor Z-score: -1.95), which could reflect a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.17) and higher than average intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.67), suggesting some disruption in the daily regularity of physiological activity. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:51 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a notable pattern of increased heart rate during daylight hours, particularly in the early afternoon (e.g., 12-1pm: Z-score 0.77, 1-2pm: Z-score -0.0) and a decrease during the night, with the most pronounced deviations occurring during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am: Z-score 0.78, 4-5am: Z-score 0.73). This pattern, in conjunction with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 7 minutes (Z-score: -0.08), which is close to average, and a somewhat later median sleep start time (02:12:45), with a standard deviation that is not exceptionally high (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.23), suggests a fragmented or shifted sleep-wake cycle. The self-reported sleep quality is also indicated as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.13), aligning with the wearable data.

The participant's CES-D score profile suggests a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology. Their higher perceived stress (Z-score: 0.65), lower happiness (Z-score: -0.53), and significantly lower health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.78) are all indicators that correlate with depressive symptoms. The reduced social engagement indicated by infrequent socializing with friends (Z-score: -1.41) and the significant internet usage (Z-score: 0.85) may reflect withdrawal behaviors commonly associated with depression. Furthermore, the higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 0.67) and the reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 0.13) could be manifestations of psychological distress. While self-esteem is not critically low, and resting heart rate is lower than average, these factors do not outweigh the combined indicators of elevated stress, reduced subjective well-being, and potential behavioral withdrawal. Considering the population CES-D mean of 13.32 and median of 11.5, scores above 11.5 fall into the top 50th percentile. The observed pattern of elevated stress, reduced well-being, and behavioral indicators suggestive of withdrawal and possible sleep disturbance point towards a CES-D score that is likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

29885,17.0,0.727979274611399,"This participant presents with a complex profile characterized by elevated anxiety, moderate self-esteem, and notable sleep disturbances. The STAI-Trait score of 43.0, while not extremely high, is associated with a moderate to high level of chronic anxiety (Z-score = 0.17), and importantly, shows a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, suggesting that anxiety proneness may be a significant contributor to depressive symptomatology. Conversely, self-esteem is within the lower range of the scale (Score = 33.0, Z-score = -0.73) and exhibits a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, indicating that lower self-worth is strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms. The PSQI score of 7.0, exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance (Z-score = 0.13), aligns with a self-reported classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" This subjective experience is further supported by objective sleep data, which shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes (Z-score = -0.31), indicating shorter than average sleep, and a notably low standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score = -1.5), suggesting a lack of variability or consistency in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time of 01:57:00, coupled with a standard deviation of 35 minutes, also points to a delayed and potentially irregular sleep schedule.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a lower than average resting heart rate (Value = 53.2, Z-score = -0.59), which is generally considered a positive physiological indicator. However, the circadian rhythm metrics reveal some irregularities. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated (Value = 76.44, Z-score = 0.34), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly elevated (Value = 14.65, Z-score = 1.25), suggesting a more pronounced diurnal fluctuation in heart rate than typically observed, potentially indicating heightened physiological reactivity or stress response. Interdaily stability (Value = 0.53, Z-score = 1.0) is low, indicating poor regularity in daily activity patterns, which is a common correlate of depressive symptoms. Intradaily variability (Value = 0.43, Z-score = -0.81) is within a typical range. The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a consistent pattern of reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score = -1.25, 3-4 AM Z-score = -1.58, 4-5 AM Z-score = -1.43), indicative of the sleep period, followed by a sharp increase in heart rate during the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 9-10 PM (Z-score = 1.9). This late evening elevation in heart rate, coupled with the late sleep onset, could suggest difficulty in winding down and initiating sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of social activities and moderate consumption of alcohol (Beer and Wine/Liquor usage are 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively). They exercise regularly, both alone and with others, at a frequency of three times a week or more (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23), which are positive lifestyle indicators. However, daily recreation habits reveal substantial engagement in sedentary activities, including watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 0.01), video games (Z-score = 0.96), and particularly sedentary hobbies (Z-score = 1.41), which are time-consuming. Internet usage is noted as ""31 minutes an hour"" (Z-score = -0.49), which is relatively lower than average, while listening to music occupies 1-2 hours daily (Z-score = 0.67). The positive correlation of sedentary behaviors and internet usage with CES-D scores suggests that increased engagement in these activities may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, higher happiness is negatively correlated with CES-D, and while the participant's current happiness score is above average (Z-score = 0.55), its correlation suggests that this positive trait is moderately protective.

Considering the constellation of findings, the participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The pronounced elevation in anxiety, coupled with low self-esteem and significant sleep disturbances, are strong correlates of depressive symptomatology. While regular exercise and a lower resting heart rate are positive, the significant irregularities in sleep patterns, the elevated amplitude of the circadian rhythm indicating physiological reactivity, and the substantial engagement in sedentary leisure activities that are positively correlated with depression point towards an increased risk. The PSQI score classifying sleep as disturbed, combined with objective sleep duration and timing irregularities, further supports this. Given these converging lines of evidence, particularly the strong negative correlation of self-esteem and positive correlation of anxiety with depressive symptoms, the participant's profile is more indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology.

79167,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally positive self-reported psychological traits and robust engagement in physical activity, juxtaposed with notable patterns in sleep and physiological regulation. In terms of self-report measures, the participant reports low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.71), indicating a disposition towards feeling calm and free from worry. Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score = 1.24), suggesting a strong sense of self-worth. Perceived stress levels are significantly low (PSS Z-score = -3.16), further contributing to a positive psychological outlook. Health satisfaction is also high (Z-score = 2.05), aligning with these favorable self-perceptions. Interpersonal trust is at a moderate level (Z-score = 0.5), indicating a balanced view of others. Happiness is reported at a high level (Z-score = 1.64).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a strong commitment to exercise, engaging in activities alone, with others, and in sports three times a week or more, as indicated by positive Z-scores for these frequencies. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine or liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week, with corresponding positive Z-scores suggesting a frequency that is higher than the population mean. Notably, the participant reports no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits include minimal engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and reporting ""do not do"" for internet usage and listening to music. Moderate engagement is observed in socializing with friends (1-2 hours) and reading (15 minutes or less), with a sedentary hobby also at 15 minutes or less.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal a generally stable circadian rhythm, though with some deviations. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population mean (Z-score = -0.81), and the amplitude is also lower (Z-score = -1.03), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 2:19 PM, which is typical. Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-score = -1.07), indicating less regularity in the daily pattern of heart rate, while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.74), suggesting more variability within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score = -0.87), further supporting a less consistent daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score = -0.65).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. There is a notable surge in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the morning hours (6-7 AM with a Z-score of 3.07, and 7-8 AM with a Z-score of 2.69), indicating a significant increase in physiological arousal during this period. Conversely, the late evening and overnight hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM) show substantial negative deviations (Z-scores ranging from -0.91 to -1.42), suggesting a marked reduction in heart rate relative to the mesor during these periods, consistent with sleep or rest. The peak positive deviation occurs in the late morning to early afternoon (11 AM-12 PM with a Z-score of 1.71 and 12 PM-1 PM with a Z-score of 0.26).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes, which is longer than the population mean (Z-score = 1.25). The standard deviation for sleep duration is within the typical range (Z-score = -0.32). The median sleep start time is approximately 11:31 PM, with a standard deviation of 65 minutes, suggesting a relatively consistent sleep onset. There are no reported daily naps, and the Z-score for mean daily naps is significantly low (Z-score = -0.86), indicating minimal napping behavior.

Considering the high levels of self-reported happiness, low perceived stress, and high self-esteem, alongside consistent engagement in exercise, the participant's overall psychological profile appears positive. The sleep duration is ample and consistent. While there are some irregularities in heart rate circadian rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability and slightly higher intradaily variability), these do not appear to be strongly correlated with CES-D scores in the provided data. The positive self-reports and behavioral patterns generally align with lower depressive symptomatology.

22455,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"This participant exhibits a multifaceted profile of self-reported psychological states, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics. Self-report data indicate significantly low perceived stress (Z-score = 2.28, negative correlation with CES-D) and high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.1, negative correlation with CES-D), which are protective factors against depressive symptomatology. Conversely, this participant reports lower-than-average trust in others (Z-score = -2.71, negative correlation with CES-D) and lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64, negative correlation with CES-D), both of which are associated with increased depressive symptoms. Their reported health satisfaction is also notably high (Z-score = 1.96, negative correlation with CES-D), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being. Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in substantial screen time, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' and 'Internet Usage' both reported as 3-4 hours daily, significantly above the population average (Z-scores of 2.54 and 1.52, respectively). They also report listening to music for 3-4 hours daily (Z-score = 1.6). Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is reported as ""Not at all,"" with corresponding negative Z-scores, indicating lower-than-average usage. Physical activity levels are mixed; the participant exercises alone three times a week or more (Z-score = 1.07), but does not engage in exercise with others or sports.

Wearable data reveal several patterns relevant to physiological regulation and circadian rhythmicity. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (Mesor Z-score = -1.04, Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.52). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also reduced (Amplitude Z-score = -1.52), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in cardiovascular activity. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs around 12:35 PM. Circadian rhythm regularity metrics indicate moderate interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.9), suggesting some variability in daily routine structure, and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.32), implying more fluctuations within a day. Notably, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the early morning hours (5-6 AM and 6-7 AM show large positive deviations, Z-scores of 6.2 and 4.31, respectively), suggesting heightened physiological arousal during this period. Conversely, late evening and early morning hours (11 PM to 3 AM) show notable negative deviations from the mesor, indicating lower cardiovascular activity. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 7 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -1.33), and a relatively stable sleep start time (standard deviation of 66 minutes). There is also a slight tendency towards more naps than average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = 0.7).

The analysis of the participant's data suggests a mixed profile with some indicators potentially associated with higher depressive symptomatology and others with lower. The self-reported low trust, low happiness, and high perceived stress are concerning, and are negatively correlated with CES-D. While the participant reports high self-esteem and health satisfaction, these do not fully outweigh the negative indicators. The sedentary lifestyle, characterized by extensive screen time, and below-average sleep duration, also warrant consideration. The wearable data reveals disrupted patterns, such as elevated arousal in the early morning and potentially lower activity during the night, alongside moderate circadian rhythm variability. Given the presence of several factors positively correlated with depressive symptoms (low trust, low happiness, high perceived stress) and lifestyle choices that can exacerbate these, it is plausible that this participant's CES-D score would fall within the upper half of the study population.

Regarding self-reported psychological traits, the participant reports low anxiety proneness, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 40.0 (Z-score: -0.13), which is within the average range for trait anxiety. Conversely, self-esteem is slightly above average, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 39.0 (Z-score: 0.11), suggesting a positive self-regard. Perceived stress levels are elevated, with a PSS score of 25.0 (Z-score: 0.92), placing them in the upper quartile of perceived stress within the study population. Subjective health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Score: 4.56, Z-score: 0.22). Interpersonal trust is relatively low, with a score of 2.83 (Z-score: -0.78), indicating a degree of wariness towards others. Self-reported happiness is moderately above average (Current: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55).

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant reports no substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs), with Z-scores indicating significantly lower usage than the population mean. Exercise frequency is relatively low, with both exercising alone and with others occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-scores: -0.43 and -0.17, respectively), and participation in sports is less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -0.42). Daily recreational activities show a pattern of both passive and active engagement. The participant reports no time spent watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games, and moderate internet usage. Notably, listening to music is a significant activity, with 2-3 hours per day, a value substantially higher than the population average (Z-score: 1.13). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score: 0.16), and dedicated reading or sedentary hobbies are not engaged in.

Wearable-derived data reveals a generally stable circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.5, Z-score: 0.75) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.46, Z-score: 1.15) suggest a moderately consistent daily pattern, though Interdaily Stability is slightly lower than the population average. Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.55, Z-score: 0.03) is average, indicating typical fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor (Value: 80.19, Z-score: 0.85) is elevated, suggesting a higher average heart rate, and the Amplitude (Value: 12.91, Z-score: 0.69) is also above average, indicating a larger variation between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:40 PM. The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (Value: 61.2, Z-score: 0.36).

Analysis of Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor reveals distinct patterns of cardiovascular arousal throughout the day. During the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM), heart rate deviates significantly below the mesor, with the most pronounced deviations observed between 5-6 AM (Value: -24.35, Z-score: -0.87). As the day progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, indicating increased arousal relative to the mesor. Peak positive deviations are observed in the afternoon, particularly between 2-3 PM (Value: 15.56, Z-score: 1.58) and 1-2 PM (Value: 16.36, Z-score: 1.38), suggesting higher physiological activity during these periods. Evenings also show elevated heart rate deviations, with a notable peak between 6-7 PM (Value: 18.72, Z-score: 1.08) and sustained elevated levels through 8-9 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score: 0.06), which is very close to the population average. However, the Sleep Duration Standard Deviation is relatively low (Value: 42 minutes, Z-score: -1.33), suggesting consistent sleep duration across nights. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:24:30), with a standard deviation of 81 minutes (Z-score: -0.03), indicating moderate consistency in sleep timing. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86), which is below the population average. The PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.8) suggests good subjective sleep quality and minimal sleep disturbances, contrary to what might be expected with elevated perceived stress.

The correlation data provides further insight into the relationships between these metrics and CES-D scores. Notably, higher STAI-Trait scores (anxiety proneness) are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting that anxiety may contribute to depressive symptoms. Conversely, higher self-esteem (0.71) and higher interpersonal trust (0.41) are correlated with lower CES-D scores, indicating protective effects. Elevated perceived stress shows a moderate positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D scores, aligning with expectations. Engagement in listening to music shows a moderate positive correlation (0.25) with CES-D scores, while increased social interaction with friends shows a negligible negative correlation (-0.01). Sleep duration standard deviation has a moderate positive correlation (0.2) with CES-D scores, and mean daily naps show a moderate positive correlation (0.21).

The participant exhibits a mixed pattern of factors potentially influencing depressive symptomatology. Elevated perceived stress is a significant concern, correlating positively with CES-D scores. The lack of significant substance use or exercise might not be protective factors. While self-esteem is relatively high and anxiety is low, the moderate positive correlation of perceived stress and some sleep-related metrics with CES-D scores warrant attention. The strong positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D, despite the participant's current low reported anxiety, suggests a potential vulnerability. Furthermore, the moderate positive correlation between sleep duration variability and CES-D scores, coupled with a low standard deviation in sleep duration, may indicate that while sleep duration is consistent, its variability is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The moderate positive correlation of napping with CES-D scores suggests that this behavior might be indicative of underlying fatigue or difficulty maintaining wakefulness. Given the average CES-D score of 13.29 in the population, the participant's profile suggests a tendency towards elevated depressive symptoms, particularly due to elevated perceived stress and potential sleep-related correlations.

Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is at a moderate level (Z-score = 0.27), with a strong positive correlation (0.81) to CES-D scores, suggesting that higher anxiety proneness may be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17), with a notable negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, indicating that lower self-worth is linked to higher depressive symptom scores. Perceived stress is significantly lower than the study population (Z-score = -1.26), but it shows a positive correlation (0.29) with CES-D. Interpersonal trust is also below average (Z-score = -0.46) and exhibits a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) with CES-D, suggesting that lower trust may be associated with more depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53) with a negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, implying lower happiness is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is above average (Z-score = 0.55) and negatively correlated (-0.39) with CES-D, suggesting that better perceived health is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Substance usage patterns are generally low, with beer and wine/liquor consumption being less than 1-2 times a month (Z-scores -0.41 and -0.55 respectively), and recreational/non-prescribed drugs not at all, showing weak correlations to CES-D.

The participant engages in regular exercise, with frequency of exercising alone, with others, and participation in sports all being three times a week or more (Z-scores 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively), and these are negatively correlated with CES-D. Daily recreational habits show some variability. Notably, reading time is significantly higher than average (Z-score = 4.24), while video game usage is also elevated (Z-score = 0.96). Listening to music and socializing with friends are also above average in duration (Z-scores 1.13 and 0.95 respectively). Internet usage and watching TV/videos/movies are close to the population average. Sedentary hobbies are also engaged in for 2-3 hours daily (Z-score = 2.01). These recreational activities exhibit weak correlations with CES-D scores, with the exception of socializing with friends and listening to music which have slight negative correlations, suggesting a potential protective effect.

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, indicated by moderate interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.67) and a slightly below average intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.18). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.48), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. The mesor, representing average heart rate, is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.27) with a resting heart rate also close to average (Z-score = -0.07). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.39), and the acrophase, the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:17 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of significantly lower than expected heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score = -0.46; 4-5 AM, Z-score = -0.72; 5-6 AM, Z-score = -0.65), which could suggest periods of deep sleep or reduced physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, Z-score = 1.51; 2-3 PM, Z-score = 1.15; 7-8 PM, Z-score = 0.64). These deviations from the mesor show weak correlations with CES-D scores, with a slight negative correlation for the late afternoon peak (e.g., 4-5 PM, -0.07) and late evening (e.g., 6-7 PM, -0.10).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -0.69), and this duration has a near-zero correlation with CES-D. However, the sleep duration standard deviation is notably high (Z-score = 3.21), suggesting significant variability in nightly sleep, which has a positive correlation with CES-D, implying inconsistent sleep may be linked to higher depressive symptoms. The median sleep start time is very late (02:07:50), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is also high (Z-score = 1.54), indicating further sleep schedule irregularity. The absence of daily naps (Z-score = -0.86) shows a positive correlation with CES-D, suggesting napping might be associated with lower depressive symptoms in this context. The PSQI score is low (Z-score = -0.8) suggesting good subjective sleep quality, which has a negative correlation with CES-D, indicating good sleep quality is associated with fewer depressive symptoms.

Considering the high prevalence of anxiety, lower self-esteem and happiness, and the strong positive correlations of these traits with CES-D, along with the significant sleep duration variability and its positive correlation, the overall evidence suggests a leaning towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While perceived stress is low, and health satisfaction is high, the negative correlations of these with CES-D indicate that a decrease in health satisfaction or an increase in stress would likely exacerbate depressive symptoms. The consistent negative correlations of exercise and positive correlations of sedentary activities with CES-D, although weak, also contribute to this assessment.

29257,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that warrant careful consideration in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-report data indicate relatively low anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -1.02) and higher self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: 1.1), which are generally protective factors against depression. However, the participant also reports moderate levels of perceived stress (Stress Z-score: -0.71), which, while not significantly elevated, can contribute to overall psychological burden. Interpersonal trust is also reported at a slightly above-average level (Trust Z-score: 0.83), and health satisfaction is moderately high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.72). Happiness levels are slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). The subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI Z-score: -1.26), suggesting that any sleep disturbances are not perceived as significant by the participant.

Behavioral data reveal a mixed pattern. Substance usage, particularly beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01), is at a higher than average frequency. Exercise frequency is moderate, with solitary and group exercise occurring 1-2 times a week, and sports participation being notably absent (Sports Z-score: -1.09). Leisure activities show a significant preference for listening to music for extended periods (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06), while time spent on other sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, and internet usage is relatively low. Reading and other sedentary hobbies are also reported as not being engaged in. This pattern of high music engagement and low participation in other recreational activities may reflect a tendency towards passive or solitary coping mechanisms.

Wearable data provide insights into physiological regularity and arousal patterns. The participant exhibits a less regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by lower than average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.23) and moderate intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -0.6). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly elevated (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 0.81), suggesting some degree of daily rhythm, though its stability is compromised. The Mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is close to the population average (Mesor Z-score: -0.13), and the amplitude of the daily heart rate variation is slightly lower than average (Amplitude Z-score: -0.75), indicating a less pronounced diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:43 PM). The resting heart rate is within the average range (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.12). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern: significantly elevated heart rate deviations are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score: 0.92, 3-4 AM Z-score: 1.2, 4-5 AM Z-score: 1.15, 5-6 AM Z-score: 0.75). This elevated physiological arousal during sleep initiation or early sleep stages, coupled with generally moderate sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.79) and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.03), suggests potential sleep fragmentation or difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep despite subjective reports of good sleep quality.

The correlation data, while supportive, must be interpreted cautiously. The positive correlation between STAI and CES-D (0.81) suggests that higher anxiety is associated with higher depressive symptoms, but this participant's anxiety is low. Conversely, higher self-esteem (correlation -0.71) and trust (correlation -0.41) are associated with lower CES-D scores, which aligns with this participant's profile. Perceived stress shows a weak positive correlation (0.28), and happiness shows a weak negative correlation (-0.46) with CES-D. The correlations with behavioral and wearable metrics are generally weak, offering limited direct guidance for CES-D interpretation. However, the moderate sleep duration and a slight tendency towards irregular sleep patterns, indicated by the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score: 1.14), could be indirectly related to depressive symptoms. The elevated heart rate during early morning hours is particularly noteworthy as it could be a physiological indicator of distress or disrupted sleep architecture, which can be associated with depression.

Based on the available data, the participant exhibits several factors that could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms, despite having high self-esteem and low anxiety. The elevated heart rate during early morning hours, coupled with a relatively long sleep duration that is still variable, suggests potential underlying sleep disruption that may not be subjectively perceived. Furthermore, the significant engagement in passive leisure (listening to music for extended periods) and avoidance of sports might indicate a lack of engagement in activities that typically buffer against depression. While the participant reports good subjective sleep quality and high self-esteem, these factors may not fully compensate for potential physiological dysregulation during sleep and limited engagement in health-promoting activities. Considering these elements in conjunction with the overall CES-D population statistics (Mean: 13.34, 50th percentile: 11.5), and observing the interplay of moderate perceived stress, lower happiness, and the potential for sleep disturbance indicated by physiological data, it is plausible that the participant's CES-D score could fall within the upper half of the distribution.

Daily recreation involves minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music, while internet usage and reading are within population norms. Socializing with friends is also reported as limited.

Wearable data reveals significant deviations in heart rate patterns. The participant exhibits a low mesor (Mesor Z-score of -1.57), indicating a generally lower baseline heart rate compared to the study population, which is positively correlated with CES-D (0.19). Intradaily variability in heart rate is exceptionally high (Intradaily Variability Z-score of 2.01), suggesting a highly erratic cardiovascular response throughout the day, with a weak negative correlation to CES-D (-0.05). Interdaily stability is also low (Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.75), indicating a lack of consistent daily rhythm in heart rate, correlated at 0.0 with CES-D. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is consistently reported at 5:26 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. A marked elevation in heart rate deviation is observed during the late evening to early morning hours, particularly between 11 PM and 12 AM (11-12am Z-score of 4.79), which is strongly associated with the CES-D score. Conversely, the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM) show the most pronounced negative deviations, indicating significantly lower heart rates during this period, with some positive correlations to CES-D. The midday period (12 PM to 3 PM) also shows elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor.

Sleep statistics indicate a near-average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of 0.18) with a notably low standard deviation in sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of -1.47), suggesting consistent sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is quite late (01:45:29), and the standard deviation in sleep start time is also low (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.96), indicating a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. The absence of naps further supports a structured, though nocturnal, sleep pattern.

Holistically, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. High self-esteem, low trait anxiety, and above-average trust and health satisfaction are protective factors. However, disturbed subjective sleep quality, below-average happiness, and particularly the highly irregular heart rate patterns, including the exceptionally elevated heart rate deviation late at night, are concerning. The late and consistent sleep start time, coupled with very low intradaily variability in sleep timing, might reflect a rigid sleep schedule that does not align with optimal circadian functioning. The strong positive correlation between the late-night heart rate spike and CES-D, alongside the negative correlation with self-esteem and happiness, points towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The significant deviations in heart rate variability and stability suggest physiological dysregulation that could be indicative of or contribute to depressive symptomatology. Given the strong negative correlation with self-esteem and happiness, and the concerning patterns in heart rate variability and late-night activity, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

63904,30.0,0.9119170984455959,"This participant exhibits a profile characterized by heightened anxiety, lower self-esteem, and a notable absence of substance use and formal exercise. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 53.0 indicates a Z-score of 1.16, suggesting the participant experiences chronic anxiety at a level above the study population mean, with a strong positive correlation (0.81) between this trait and CES-D score. Conversely, their Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) score of 30.0 yields a Z-score of -1.15, indicating lower self-worth compared to peers, and shows a significant negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D. Interpersonal trust is also significantly lower than average, with a Z-score of -2.07 and a moderate negative correlation (-0.40) with CES-D. Self-reported happiness is also below the population average (Z-score = -1.61, correlation = -0.46). While perceived stress (PSS) is only slightly above average (Z-score = 0.38, correlation = 0.28), the combination of high anxiety, low self-esteem, low trust, and low happiness presents a consistent pattern of psychological distress.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no engagement in substance use (beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and a complete absence of exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports. This is reflected in significantly low Z-scores for these activities, with correlations to CES-D being negligible to mildly negative. Daily sedentary habits are prevalent, with significant time spent on internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.85) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.95). However, engagement in passive entertainment like watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, listening to music, and reading is reported as ""Do not do"" or limited, indicated by low Z-scores and weak correlations with CES-D. This pattern suggests a potential reliance on social interaction and internet use for engagement, while other forms of recreation are largely absent.

Wearable data reveals disturbances in sleep patterns and circadian rhythm regularity. The median sleep duration of 5 hours and 49 minutes has a Z-score of -1.69, indicating significantly shorter sleep than the population average, with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. The standard deviation for sleep duration is also notably low (Z-score = -1.61), suggesting consistently short sleep rather than variability. The median sleep start time is very late, at 1:34 AM, with a standard deviation of 60 minutes (Z-score = -0.5). This late sleep onset contributes to a disrupted sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm metrics show a relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.0) and higher intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.63) in heart rate, suggesting reduced daily regularity. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs in the afternoon (3:36 PM). The aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates a notable dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-5 AM), with significant negative deviations from the mesor (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score = -0.94, 3-4 AM Z-score = -0.81, 4-5 AM Z-score = -0.5). Conversely, there are increases in heart rate during the late morning to early afternoon (e.g., 8-9 AM Z-score = 1.58, 9-10 AM Z-score = 0.72) and in the evening (e.g., 5-6 PM Z-score = 0.45). This pattern of disrupted sleep and irregular heart rate variability, coupled with the psychological profile, warrants careful consideration in relation to depressive symptomatology.

Considering the aggregate data, the participant presents with a constellation of factors suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. The significantly elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, low trust, and low happiness, alongside profoundly disrupted sleep patterns (short duration, late onset, poor quality indicated by PSQI), and a less stable circadian rhythm in heart rate, all correlate positively with increased CES-D scores. While there is no direct CES-D score provided, the strong negative correlations with self-esteem and trust, and positive correlations with anxiety, strongly suggest a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The absence of engagement in physical activity and a preference for sedentary habits further aligns with patterns often seen in individuals experiencing depression. The sleep metrics, in particular, with a Z-score of -1.69 for duration and a late sleep start time, are indicative of significant sleep disturbance which is a hallmark of depression. Given these convergent indicators, particularly the strong negative correlations with self-esteem and trust, and the positive correlation with anxiety, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

20335,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"This participant exhibits a complex pattern of psychological and behavioral indicators, with several features deviating from population norms and showing correlations with depressive symptomatology. Their self-reported STAI-Trait score is notably low (Z-score = -1.81), indicating a disposition towards low chronic anxiety, and shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting that while currently not anxious, increases in anxiety proneness would be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, their self-esteem score is high (Z-score = 1.66), which correlates negatively with CES-D ( -0.71), implying that higher self-esteem is protective against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is at a moderate level (Z-score = -0.71) with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (0.28). Self-reported happiness is significantly higher than the population average (Z-score = 1.64), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (-0.46). Health satisfaction is also elevated (Z-score = 1.3), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting good subjective health perception.

Regarding behavioral habits, this individual reports moderate substance usage, with wine or liquor consumption occurring 1-2 times per week (Z-score = 0.94) and beer 1-2 times a month (Z-score = 0.3). Notably, they abstain from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise frequency is relatively high, with solo exercise occurring three times a week or more (Z-score = 1.07) and participation in sports or exercising with others occurring less frequently (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits reveal a significant engagement in sedentary activities, with substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 0.64), playing video games (Z-score = 1.71), and engaging in sedentary hobbies (Z-score = 2.01). They also report significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13) and socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score = 1.74). Internet usage falls within the typical range (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.18). These high levels of sedentary leisure activities, particularly video games and sedentary hobbies, show weak positive correlations with CES-D scores.

Wearable data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.57 (Z-score = 1.33) and an Intradaily Variability of 0.66 (Z-score = 0.81). The autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.43, Z-score = 0.9) also suggests a degree of daily patterning. The Mesor (78.09, Z-score = 0.57) and Amplitude (13.56, Z-score = 0.9) of heart rate are within expected ranges. The Acrophase, indicating peak heart rate, is reported around 6:06 PM. The resting heart rate is slightly lower than average (55.0, Z-score = -0.37), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (0.19). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals significant deviations, particularly during the late night and early morning hours. The 12-1 AM period shows a substantial elevation (23.89, Z-score = 3.66), while the period between 3-6 AM shows marked dips (e.g., 4-5 AM, -25.52, Z-score = -1.23). Evening hours (6-7 PM, 10-11 PM) also show higher than average heart rate deviations. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score = -0.74), which is slightly below average, and a median sleep start time of 1:53 AM (Z-score = -1.24), also later than typical. Both sleep duration and start time standard deviations are within the typical range. Mean daily naps are negligible. The correlations of these sleep metrics with CES-D are very low.

Considering the CES-D population data, where the 50th percentile is 11.5 and the 75th percentile is 18.0, this participant's overall profile presents a mixed picture. While they report high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, and low trait anxiety, which are protective factors against depression, their significant engagement in sedentary activities and slightly reduced sleep duration and later sleep onset are notable. The positive correlations between sedentary habits and CES-D, and the weak positive correlation between resting heart rate and CES-D, warrant consideration. However, the very low trait anxiety and high self-esteem appear to be strong moderating factors. The PSQI score indicates good subjective sleep quality, mitigating concerns about sleep disturbance. The substantial elevation in heart rate during late night/early morning hours, while showing a positive correlation with CES-D, is contextualized by the generally stable circadian rhythmicity and moderate resting heart rate. Given the strong protective factors like high self-esteem and low trait anxiety, and the fact that key indicators of depressive symptomatology (e.g., perceived stress, sleep quality) are not markedly elevated, it is probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the lower to median range of the study population.

35031,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"This participant presents a complex profile with notable deviations in several psychological and behavioral domains. Self-reported measures indicate a low level of anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI-Trait score significantly below the study population's mean (Z-score = -1.41) and a strong positive correlation (0.81) with the STAI score itself. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.68), though the correlation with depressive symptomatology is negative (-0.71), suggesting higher self-esteem may be associated with lower CES-D scores. Perceived stress is also relatively low (Z-score = -0.98), with a positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D, indicating that higher perceived stress is marginally associated with increased depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.53), with a negative correlation (-0.46), implying that lower happiness is associated with higher CES-D scores. Interpersonal trust is also slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.46), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41), suggesting that lower trust may be linked to higher CES-D scores. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.13) with a negative correlation (-0.39), which is expected if higher health satisfaction is linked to lower depressive symptoms.

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times/week, Z-score = 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times/week, Z-score = 0.94) with minimal correlation to CES-D. Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-scores = -0.31 and -0.11, respectively), with positive correlations to CES-D, suggesting these behaviors, when present, may be associated with higher depressive symptoms, but their absence here does not strongly influence the CES-D score. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, and participation in sports are reported at a moderate level (frequencies around 1-2 times a week), with slight positive Z-scores. Daily recreation includes significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 0.64) and socializing with friends (Z-score = 0.95), with the latter showing a negligible correlation to CES-D. Internet usage is moderate (Z-score = -0.49), while listening to music is less frequent (Z-score = -0.72). Notably, video games and reading are not engaged in. The time spent on sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies show mild positive correlations to CES-D, implying a potential association between these behaviors and elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal a disrupted circadian rhythm, as indicated by significantly low Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -1.81) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = -1.87), alongside elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score = 1.16). The Mesor (mean heart rate across the day) is elevated (Z-score = 1.13) and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably low (Z-score = -1.85), suggesting a flattened and less dynamic daily heart rate pattern. The Acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (5:35 PM). The participant's Resting Heart Rate is significantly elevated compared to the population (Z-score = 2.06). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates a pattern of relative undershoot during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM show strong negative deviations from Mesor, with Z-scores up to 1.66), potentially reflecting impaired recovery or an atypical nocturnal heart rate profile. Conversely, late evening hours show periods of elevated heart rate deviation from Mesor (e.g., 10-11 PM show positive deviations with Z-scores up to 0.97). These physiological markers of disrupted circadian rhythm and elevated resting heart rate have weak to moderate positive correlations with CES-D scores.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 3 minutes, Z-score = 1.08) with a typical standard deviation. However, the median sleep start time is very late (00:16:06) with a slightly elevated standard deviation (96 minutes, Z-score = 0.28), suggesting a tendency towards a delayed sleep phase. The incidence of napping is slightly elevated (0.14 daily naps, Z-score = 0.82), with a positive correlation to CES-D, suggesting that more frequent napping is associated with increased depressive symptoms. The PSQI score indicates good subjective sleep quality (Z-score = -0.8), which contrasts with some of the objective sleep metrics and the higher resting heart rate.

Considering the collective data, several indicators point towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The elevated Resting Heart Rate, disrupted circadian rhythm (low Interdaily Stability, low Amplitude, high Intradaily Variability), and increased napping frequency are all physiological and behavioral markers often associated with elevated depressive symptomatology and have positive correlations with CES-D. While self-reported anxiety is low and self-esteem is relatively high, these factors are countered by slightly below average happiness and trust, and a higher perceived stress level, all of which have negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting they might be contributing to elevated symptoms. The sedentary recreational habits, particularly time spent watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies, also show a positive correlation with CES-D. The late sleep onset time, while not directly correlated to CES-D, is often a symptom of mood disturbances. The population CES-D mean is 13.33, with a 75th percentile of 18.0. Given the presence of multiple physiological and behavioral indicators that correlate positively with CES-D, and a slightly elevated resting heart rate, it is plausible this participant falls within the upper half of the distribution.

88185,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics. A notable aspect of their self-reported data includes a high level of happiness (Z-score of 1.64), which correlates negatively with CES-D scores, suggesting that elevated happiness is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Conversely, a moderately high self-esteem score (Z-score of 0.82) also shows a negative correlation with CES-D, indicating that higher self-worth is linked to lower depressive symptomatology. The participant reports low anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.22), which also correlates positively with CES-D, suggesting that lower anxiety is associated with more depressive symptoms, which is counterintuitive and may warrant further investigation. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.33, and this metric shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D, indicating that poorer subjective sleep quality is marginally associated with increased depressive symptoms. Daily recreational activities show high engagement in listening to music (Z-score of 2.06) and socializing with friends (Z-score of 0.95), both of which are weakly negatively correlated with CES-D, suggesting these activities may be protective against depressive symptoms. Conversely, passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games are engaged in minimally or not at all.

Analysis of wearable-derived data reveals several important patterns. The participant's mesor (mean heart rate) is elevated (Z-score of 0.76), and the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is also high (Z-score of 1.06), suggesting potentially higher physiological arousal or stress. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is observed at 5:00 PM. The resting heart rate is within the normal range (Z-score of -0.1). The interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score of 1.33), indicating a very regular daily pattern in cardiovascular activity, which has a near-zero correlation with CES-D. Intradaily variability, however, is lower than average (Z-score of -0.32), suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate within a given day. Examining the aggregated hourly mean deviation from the mesor reveals periods of significant cardiac activity deviations. The early morning hours (e.g., 4-8 AM) show the largest negative deviations, implying a period of lower-than-average heart rate during these times, with a moderate positive correlation for the 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM periods. Conversely, the afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 1-3 PM and 6-8 PM) exhibit the most significant positive deviations from the mesor, indicating periods of elevated heart rate during these times, with negative correlations for the 1-2 PM and 2-3 PM periods, and a weaker negative correlation for the 6-7 PM period. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score of -0.7), which is below the population average, and a low standard deviation in sleep duration, suggesting consistent but potentially insufficient sleep. The median sleep start time is very late (02:25:14 AM), with a slightly higher than average standard deviation, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The correlation of median sleep duration with CES-D is negligible, while the standard deviation of sleep duration shows a weak positive correlation, suggesting that more consistent sleep duration might be associated with more depressive symptoms. The participant reports no daily naps and a mean daily nap value of 0.0, which correlates positively with CES-D, indicating that napping is associated with fewer depressive symptoms.

Holistically, while the participant reports high happiness and low anxiety, which would typically be associated with lower depressive symptoms, their subjective sleep quality is disturbed, and their sleep duration is somewhat insufficient. The wearable data reveals a highly structured but somewhat dysregulated circadian rhythm, with elevated heart rate amplitude and significant deviations during specific parts of the day. The lack of naps, despite a positive correlation with CES-D, is concerning. The significant positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that lower trait anxiety is associated with higher depressive symptom reporting, a paradoxical finding that may indicate underlying coping mechanisms or a specific manifestation of their symptomatology. Given the mixed signals, particularly the disturbed sleep, late sleep onset, and the counterintuitive correlations of anxiety and happiness with CES-D, it is difficult to definitively place the participant in either the top or bottom 50% without a specific CES-D score. However, the presence of disturbed sleep, potentially insufficient sleep duration, and a high mesor and amplitude in heart rate suggest physiological factors that can contribute to depressive symptoms. The high interdaily stability combined with low intradaily variability in heart rate indicates a rigid daily rhythm, which can be characteristic of depressive states. The absence of naps, which positively correlates with lower CES-D, also suggests a potential deficit. These factors collectively lean towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

35344,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"This participant presents a complex interplay of psychological and physiological markers. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated (Z-score 2.05), suggesting a pronounced trait-level proneness to anxiety. This is accompanied by low self-esteem (Z-score -1.57) and low self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61), indicating a negative self-perception and affect. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (Z-score 0.65), and interpersonal trust is also higher than average (Z-score 1.79). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is also reported as disturbed (Z-score 1.05), aligning with a higher-than-average score that suggests clinical significance. Substance use, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs with moderate frequency (1-2 times a week, Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise habits indicate a strong tendency to exercise alone (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), with less frequent engagement in exercising with others or in sports. Daily recreation is characterized by significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64), and notably low engagement in activities such as video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies, with particularly low reported times for socializing (Z-score -1.41).

Wearable-derived data offer further insights into the participant's physiological and behavioral patterns. The circadian rhythm analysis shows moderate interdaily stability (Z-score 0.25) and intradaily variability (Z-score 0.1) of heart rate, suggesting a somewhat regular daily pattern. The mesor (average heart rate across the day) is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.56), and the resting heart rate is also higher than the population average (Z-score 0.67). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is within the population norm (Z-score 0.15). The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, there are substantial negative deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-4 AM, Z-scores -1.39 to -0.15), indicating lower than average heart rate during these periods, which could correspond to sleep or periods of low activity. Conversely, there are significant positive deviations during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, 3-4 PM, 4-5 PM, Z-scores 1.06, 0.72, 0.67 respectively), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal or activity during these times. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (7 hours 47 minutes, Z-score 0.74) and a slightly later median sleep start time. The standard deviation of sleep duration and start time are within or below population norms, suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule in terms of timing, despite the reported subjective disturbance. The absence of daily naps is consistent with a population average.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the elevated anxiety, low self-esteem and happiness, disturbed sleep quality, and reduced social engagement point towards a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The correlations provided, while not definitive, generally align with these interpretations, with positive correlations between CES-D and STAI, PSQI, and perceived stress, and negative correlations with self-esteem and happiness. The observed physiological patterns, such as elevated resting heart rate and distinct patterns of deviation from the mesor throughout the day, may also be reflective of underlying psychological distress. Although sleep duration is objectively longer, the subjective reports of poor quality, combined with other psychological indicators, suggest a substantial impact on well-being. Therefore, the participant's constellation of self-reported traits, behaviors, and physiological markers suggests a profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology.

31175,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"This participant presents a multifaceted profile with notable deviations in sleep patterns, physiological regulation, and self-reported psychological states, all of which warrant consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. The wearable data reveals a significantly longer median sleep duration (9 hours 34 minutes) with a substantial standard deviation (249 minutes), indicating both excessive sleep and considerable variability in sleep duration. This, coupled with a median sleep start time of 23:17 and a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (84 minutes), suggests potential disruptions in circadian rhythmicity. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Score: 8.0, Z-Score: 0.59), aligning with the objective sleep data.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a lower-than-average mesor (64.59, Z-Score: -1.28) and amplitude (8.28, Z-Score: -0.81) in their heart rate data, suggesting reduced overall cardiovascular activity and potentially attenuated diurnal variation. The aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates lower-than-average heart rate deviations during the late evening and overnight hours (e.g., 12-1am: -9.34, Z-Score: -1.07; 1-2am: -12.32, Z-Score: -0.65), and a notable increase during the afternoon (e.g., 2-3pm: 13.19, Z-Score: 1.14; 4-5pm: 13.27, Z-Score: 0.67), with the acrophase occurring around 3:34 PM. While this suggests a discernible diurnal pattern, the reduced mesor and amplitude might reflect a blunted physiological response. The interdaily stability of the circadian rhythm (0.39, Z-Score: -0.16) is within the average range, but the intradaily variability (0.3, Z-Score: -1.73) is notably low, suggesting a more predictable, albeit potentially suppressed, pattern of heart rate fluctuations throughout the day.

Self-reported psychological data indicate average levels of trait anxiety (STAI Score: 40.0, Z-Score: -0.13) and slightly above-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Score: 41.0, Z-Score: 0.4; note: higher RSES scores indicate *higher* self-esteem, and the Z-score suggests the participant's score is above the mean of the population, contrary to the interpretation of the data which states scores range from 10-40). However, self-reported happiness is below average (Current Happiness: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53). Perceived stress is elevated (Stress Score: 24.0, Z-Score: 0.65), and health satisfaction is slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Score: 5.11, Z-Score: 0.63; note: higher scores indicate higher satisfaction, thus a positive Z-score here signifies higher satisfaction which contradicts the interpretation given). Behavioral patterns reveal consistent moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week) and a high frequency of exercising alone and participating in sports (three times a week or more), but no exercise with others. Leisure time is predominantly spent watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, and socializing with friends for extended periods, while reading and video games are not engaged in. Internet usage is also moderate. The correlation analyses, though to be considered supplementary, suggest that higher self-esteem, trust, and happiness are associated with lower CES-D scores, while higher stress and poorer sleep quality are linked to higher CES-D scores.

Considering the available evidence, the participant exhibits several indicators that align with a potentially elevated CES-D score, suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptomatology within the study population. The significantly prolonged and variable sleep duration, coupled with subjectively reported disturbed sleep, is a common correlate of depression. While objective circadian rhythm metrics show some regularity (interdaily stability), the low intradaily variability in heart rate, alongside reduced mesor and amplitude, may indicate a blunted physiological arousal, which can be associated with depressed mood. The self-reported lower happiness levels and elevated perceived stress further contribute to this profile. Although self-esteem is reported as above average, the negative correlation with CES-D suggests that even within this higher range, decreases in self-esteem would be linked to more severe depressive symptoms. The correlation analysis indicates that factors such as trust and happiness are negatively associated with CES-D scores, and this participant reports lower happiness. Conversely, stress and poor sleep quality are positively correlated with CES-D, both of which are evident in this participant's data. While not all indicators point to elevated depressive symptoms, the confluence of disrupted sleep, potential physiological blunting, lower reported happiness, and higher perceived stress suggests a leaning towards the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

Psychometrically, the participant reports elevated anxiety proneness, as indicated by a high STAI score (0.46 standard deviations above the mean), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.82). Conversely, self-esteem is lower than average, with a Z-score of -0.73, and this measure shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress levels are slightly below average (Z-score of -0.44), with a weak positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D. Happiness levels are also below average (Z-score of -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, indicating that lower happiness is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score of 1.3), with a negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D, suggesting better health satisfaction may be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.83), with a weak negative correlation (-0.41) to CES-D, indicating that higher trust may be linked to lower depressive symptoms.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are high, with the participant exercising alone and with others more than three times a week (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91). These higher levels of physical activity are associated with weak negative correlations to CES-D scores. Sedentary behaviors such as watching TV, video games, and listening to music are infrequent or absent, while internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours). Notably, the participant reports significant time spent socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74), which shows a very weak negative correlation to CES-D.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a highly regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by a high mesor (79.55, Z-score 0.77) and amplitude (13.88, Z-score 1.0), and a relatively stable interdaily stability (0.42, Z-score 0.09). The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is observed in the mid-afternoon (3:45 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is within the average range (Z-score 0.07). Analysis of mean hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. There is a significant dip in heart rate deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -23.76 at 5-6 AM, Z-score -0.78), followed by a pronounced increase in heart rate deviation during the morning (e.g., 30.3 at 8-9 AM, Z-score 3.52) and late afternoon (e.g., 22.3 at 4-5 PM, Z-score 2.0). Conversely, heart rate deviations are negative during the early morning and late evening hours.

Sleep patterns are characterized by longer than average sleep durations (median 9 hours 2 minutes, Z-score 2.3), with a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score -0.15). The median sleep start time is late (23:14:42), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score 0.46). Napping behavior is minimal. Subjectively, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) indicates good sleep quality (Z-score -0.8), with a score of 5.0 which is not indicative of clinically significant sleep disturbance. These positive sleep metrics generally show weak correlations with CES-D scores.

Considering the provided data, the participant's CES-D score would likely fall in the **top_50** percentile of the study population. This conclusion is based on the presence of several indicators associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The elevated anxiety proneness (STAI score) and its strong positive correlation with CES-D are significant. Concurrently, lower self-esteem and lower self-reported happiness, both exhibiting moderate negative correlations with CES-D, further support this assessment. While other factors like high physical activity and good subjective sleep quality are generally protective against depression, the strength of the associations between anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, and CES-D scores, alongside the overall pattern of self-reported psychological states, suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The physiological data, particularly the pronounced fluctuations in heart rate deviations during the day, do not strongly contradict this interpretation, and the temporal aggregation of this data limits inferring a direct link to immediate depressive states.

96689,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"This participant presents with a complex profile characterized by heightened anxiety, moderate self-esteem, and indications of disturbed sleep, all within the context of a generally sedentary lifestyle. The STAI-Trait score of 47.0, with a Z-score of 0.56, suggests a tendency towards chronic anxiety, which is further supported by a positive correlation (0.82) with depressive symptoms. While the participant's self-esteem is within the average range (Score: 39.0, Z-Score: 0.11), its negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores implies that lower self-esteem is associated with increased depressive symptoms, a common pattern. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score: 6.0, Z-Score: -0.33), which is consistent with the observed sleep duration standard deviation of 38 minutes (Z-Score: -1.42), suggesting some variability in nightly sleep. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-Score: 0.14) is near the population mean, but the significant standard deviation in sleep duration points to potential disruptions. The median sleep start time of 01:55:30, with a standard deviation of 29 minutes (Z-Score: -1.19), indicates a delayed sleep onset pattern that is relatively consistent.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Mesor: 77.78, Z-Score: 0.52) and a high amplitude (14.98, Z-Score: 1.36), suggesting a more pronounced fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, potentially indicative of a less stable autonomic nervous system response. The circadian rhythm metrics reveal a notable lack of regularity, with Interdaily Stability at 0.5 (Z-Score: 0.75) and Intradaily Variability at 0.65 (Z-Score: 0.74), both indicating a less structured daily pattern of physiological activity. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of 0.44 (Z-Score: 0.98) further supports this, suggesting a weak adherence to a daily cycle. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight periods of significant deviation, particularly during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-7 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.08 to -2.47), which could reflect difficulties in maintaining consistent physiological states during these periods. Conversely, there are pronounced positive deviations during the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 6-10 PM, with Z-scores ranging from 1.16 to 1.62), indicating elevated cardiovascular activity during these times.

Behaviorally, the participant reports a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, with no reported usage of alcohol, wine, liquor, or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, which aligns with a lower-than-average engagement in substance use (e.g., Beer Usage Z-Score: -1.12). There is also a notable absence of regular exercise, with 'Exercised Alone', 'Exercised with Others', and 'Sports' all reported as 'Not at all' (Z-Scores: -1.93, -1.58, -1.09 respectively), indicating a significant deficit in physical activity. Daily recreation is primarily characterized by moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.18) and listening to music (16-30 minutes, Z-Score: -0.26), with limited engagement in more active or intellectually stimulating pursuits like reading or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends for 2-3 hours (Z-Score: 0.95) stands out as a more significant social engagement, though its correlation with CES-D is minimal. The extremely low Health Satisfaction score (Score: 2.11, Z-score: -1.61) is a significant indicator of poor well-being, with a strong negative correlation (-0.4) to CES-D, suggesting that lower health satisfaction is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The low self-reported happiness (Score: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53) and moderate perceived stress (Score: 20.0, Z-Score: -0.44) are also relevant, with happiness having a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) and perceived stress a moderate positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D.

Considering the constellation of factors, including heightened anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, a sedentary lifestyle with no regular exercise, low health satisfaction, and a tendency towards less regulated physiological rhythms, there is substantial evidence suggesting elevated depressive symptomatology. The correlation data consistently points towards negative emotional states and poor well-being metrics being associated with higher CES-D scores. While the participant engages in some social activities, the overall pattern of self-reported well-being and behavioral engagement leans towards a higher symptom burden.

33657,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"This participant presents a complex profile characterized by several notable self-reported and wearable-derived metrics. In terms of psychological traits, the participant reports generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.43) and a moderately high level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.4). They also report a moderate level of interpersonal trust (Trust Z-score: 0.5) and happiness (Happy Z-score: 0.55). Perceived stress levels are within the average range for the population (Stress Z-score: -0.44). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), which is further supported by a higher-than-average frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 2.23).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94, respectively), but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is relatively low, particularly when exercising with others, though they do report exercising alone 1-2 times a week. Sedentary behaviors are pronounced, with a very high frequency of engagement in sedentary hobbies (Sedentary Hobby Z-score: 3.19) and moderate internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score: 0.85). Notably, they report not engaging in watching TV/videos/movies or reading.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a lower-than-average mesor (Mesor Z-score: -1.46) and amplitude (Amplitude Z-score: -1.18) in their heart rate variability, suggesting a generally subdued cardiovascular profile. Their resting heart rate is also below average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.83). Circadian rhythm stability appears somewhat compromised, as indicated by a lower interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.49) and higher intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.74). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significant deviation from the mesor during the late morning hours, peaking between 10-11 am (Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor 10-11am Z-score: 2.71), which is considerably higher than the population average. Conversely, there are marked dips in heart rate deviation during the late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7-8 pm and 9-10 pm.

The participant's sleep duration is approximately average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.13), with a standard deviation indicating relatively consistent sleep durations. However, their sleep start times exhibit greater variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.42).

Considering the totality of the data, the participant exhibits a profile that suggests a greater likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology. While self-reported anxiety is low and self-esteem is moderate, the presence of disturbed sleep, a high frequency of naps, significantly prolonged sedentary behavior, and particularly the substantial periods of reduced heart rate deviation during the evening and night, alongside a lower mesor and amplitude in heart rate, are all indicative of potential depressive symptoms. The heightened internet usage and avoidance of passive recreational activities like watching TV may also be relevant. The elevated digital engagement in the absence of other leisure activities could be a coping mechanism or a reflection of low mood and anhedonia.

36117,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"The participant exhibits a range of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful consideration in the context of depressive symptomatology. Self-report data indicate a notable absence of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.33), suggesting a dispositionally calm outlook. Counterbalancing this, however, is a significantly low self-esteem score (Z-Score: 0.96, interpreted in reverse due to scale direction), which is negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting lower self-esteem may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports very low levels of happiness (Z-Score: 1.64), a metric with a substantial negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.46), indicating that diminished happiness is a strong indicator of elevated depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress levels are moderate (Z-Score: -0.17), with a slight positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.28). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Z-Score: 0.59), with a positive correlation to CES-D scores, suggesting poorer sleep quality is associated with greater depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is high (Z-Score: 1.79), though its correlation with CES-D is weakly negative (-0.41).

Behavioral patterns reveal a mixed profile. Substance usage, including beer, wine, or liquor, is infrequent (1-2 times a month) with negligible correlations to CES-D scores. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all"". Exercise habits are characterized by infrequent solo exercise (Not at all, Z-Score: -1.93) but frequent exercise with others (Three times a week or more, Z-Score: 1.23). Daily recreational habits include substantial internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.19) and very high levels of socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.53), both with weak correlations to CES-D. Conversely, time spent watching TV/videos/movies is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 1.28), while reading time is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: 0.32). Sedentary hobbies are extensive (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 3.19), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data present a complex picture. The participant exhibits high mesor (Z-Score: 2.04) and amplitude (Z-Score: 1.58) values for heart rate, suggesting elevated overall physiological arousal. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (5:06 PM). Resting heart rate is also elevated (Z-Score: 1.65), with a moderate positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.19). Circadian rhythm stability, as indicated by interdaily stability (Z-Score: 1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-Score: 1.23), is relatively high, suggesting a structured daily pattern. However, intradaily variability is notably low (Z-Score: -1.94), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which may reflect a blunted physiological response. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a consistent pattern of lower than average heart rate during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-5 AM deviations ranging from -19.85 to -23.84), with a marked increase in heart rate during the evening hours (e.g., 7-9 PM deviations ranging from 15.43 to 16.98). Sleep statistics indicate a slightly longer than average median sleep duration (7 hours 39 minutes, Z-Score: 0.58) with moderate variability. The median sleep start time is very late (01:13:30), with moderate variability in sleep start time. Mean daily naps are reported as none (Z-Score: -0.86).

Considering the available data, several factors point towards a higher CES-D score. The most salient indicators include significantly low self-esteem and markedly low reported happiness, both of which demonstrate strong negative correlations with CES-D scores. Subjective sleep disturbance also contributes to this pattern. While the participant reports low trait anxiety, this is outweighed by the more direct indicators of depressive symptomatology. The high levels of socializing and moderate exercise with others, alongside low solo exercise, might suggest an attempt to mitigate negative affect. However, the extensive internet usage and sedentary hobbies present a counterbalancing behavioral pattern. The physiological data, while complex, shows elevated resting heart rate which has a positive correlation with CES-D, and the low intradaily variability may reflect a reduced capacity for physiological response, which can be associated with depressive states. The strong negative correlations between low self-esteem and low happiness with CES-D scores are particularly compelling.

92515,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"This participant presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral metrics, with several salient features warranting detailed analysis in relation to depressive symptomatology. Self-report measures indicate a generally positive disposition, with high self-esteem (Score: 41.0, Z-Score: 0.4), low perceived stress (Score: 19.0, Z-Score: -0.71), and a high level of self-reported happiness (Current: 5.0, Z-Score: 1.64). Furthermore, the participant reports a low level of anxiety proneness (STAI Score: 36.0, Z-Score: -0.52) and a moderate level of interpersonal trust (Score: 3.67, Z-Score: 0.83). These positive self-assessments are somewhat contradicted by a reported score of 6.0 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), indicating disturbed sleep, and a relatively low satisfaction with their physical health (Score: 3.22, Z-score: -0.78). Behavioral data reveal moderate engagement in social activities, exercising with others, and sports (1-2 times a week for both), along with frequent internet usage and watching TV/videos/movies for approximately 31 minutes per hour. Substance usage, particularly alcohol, is noted as 1-2 times a week for wine or liquor and 1-2 times a month for beer.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data provide further insights. The participant's resting heart rate is within the lower end of the population distribution (Value: 56.0, Z-Score: -0.26). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, there are significant deviations during the late morning and early afternoon, with values reaching 17.66 (Z-Score: 1.46) between 12 PM and 1 PM, and 13.89 (Z-Score: 0.92) between 1 PM and 2 PM. Conversely, the pre-dawn hours exhibit substantial negative deviations, particularly between 3 AM and 6 AM, with the lowest point at -16.01 (Z-Score: 0.34) between 5 AM and 6 AM. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate interdaily stability (Value: 0.42, Z-Score: 0.09) and intradaily variability (Value: 0.53, Z-Score: -0.11), suggesting a relatively stable daily rhythm. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate, is observed around 4:43 PM. Sleep statistics highlight a significantly reduced median sleep duration of 5 hours and 55 minutes (Z-Score: -1.58), accompanied by a high variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 110 minutes, Z-Score: 0.59).

Considering the totality of the data, several factors suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology, even in the presence of positive self-reports. The significantly low median sleep duration and high variability in sleep start times are strong indicators associated with poorer mental health outcomes, and this metric has a negative correlation with CES-D score. While self-reported happiness and self-esteem are high, the disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 6.0, which commonly indicates significant disturbance) and lower health satisfaction are concerning. The strong positive correlation between happiness and CES-D score (r = -0.46) suggests that even a slight decrease in happiness could correspond to an increase in CES-D. The observed pattern of heart rate deviations, with pronounced dips during early morning hours and sharp increases in the afternoon, could reflect dysregulated physiological processes potentially linked to mood. Given the substantial sleep disturbance and the presence of some negative correlations with measures often inversely related to depression (e.g., self-esteem, health satisfaction), it is plausible that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

However, interpersonal trust is notably higher than average (Trust Z-score: 1.47), and perceived stress is slightly elevated (Stress Z-score: 0.38). Health satisfaction is also above the study population mean (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.22). Regarding sleep, the participant reports generally disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score (Z-score: 0.13), aligning with a higher than average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 2.09) and a high MESOR value from cosinor analysis (Mesor Z-score: 2.03). The Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration that is longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.1), but with a significant deviation in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 1.89), suggesting irregular sleep timing. The observed daily pattern of heart rate deviation from the mesor shows a pronounced dip during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: 0.84, 4-5 AM Z-score: 1.33, 5-6 AM Z-score: 1.16), followed by a sharp increase in the evening, particularly between 6-7 PM (Z-score: -0.02) and 9-10 PM (Z-score: 0.08). This pattern, along with a low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.32) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.54), indicates a lack of robust circadian rhythmicity. In terms of activities, the participant engages in moderate levels of alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94), exercises 1-2 times a week (Exercised Alone Z-score: 0.32, Exercised with Others Z-score: 0.53), and spends considerable time watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64) and using the internet (Z-score: -1.16). Socializing with friends is reported as less than average in time spent per hour (Z-score: -0.62).

The analysis of the provided data suggests that the participant's CES-D score likely falls within the bottom 50% of the study population. While there are some indicators that might be associated with depressive symptoms, such as disturbed sleep quality and significant irregularity in sleep timing, these are counterbalanced by several factors suggesting lower or average symptomatology. The participant reports high self-esteem and low anxiety, which are protective factors against depression. Furthermore, their higher-than-average interpersonal trust, while not directly correlated with CES-D in this dataset, is generally not associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The observed heart rate variability, particularly the low interdaily stability and autocorrelation, along with the unusual pattern of deviation from the mesor, points to a disrupted circadian rhythm, which can be a feature of depression. However, the specific timing of these deviations and the overall high mesor and resting heart rate might reflect other physiological states or lifestyle factors rather than a direct marker of high depressive burden. The weak or non-significant correlations between most of these metrics and the CES-D score further support the notion that these are not strong predictors of high depressive symptomatology in this particular participant. The average levels of perceived stress and general happiness also do not strongly indicate elevated depressive symptoms.

However, a lower than average self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53) and notably low health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.53) suggest underlying negative affect or concern. Perceived stress is relatively low (Stress Z-score: -1.26). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.13), with a score of 7.0 exceeding the common threshold for significant sleep disturbance.

Behavioral habits indicate moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are high, with exercising alone and with others reported as ""Three times a week or more,"" exceeding population norms. Sports participation is less frequent, at 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational activities show significant engagement in video games (31 minutes an hour) and listening to music (3-4 hours), with lower engagement in reading (15 minutes or less) and sedentary hobbies (not at all). Socializing with friends occurs for 2-3 hours daily.

Wearable data indicate a less structured circadian rhythm compared to the population average, evidenced by lower interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.82) and higher intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.88). The mesor (mean heart rate) is below average (Mesor Z-score: -0.7), with a relatively low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.56). Sleep duration is shorter than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.85), and sleep start times are highly variable (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.88). Physiological arousal patterns show notable deviations from the mesor. Specifically, during the late night and early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate deviations are predominantly negative and pronounced, suggesting a period of lower than usual cardiovascular activity during these times. Conversely, evening hours (7 PM to 11 PM) exhibit positive deviations, indicating periods of higher cardiovascular activity relative to the mesor.

The overall analysis of this multimodal data does not strongly suggest a significantly elevated CES-D score. While there are indicators of disturbed sleep and lower happiness and health satisfaction, these are counterbalanced by high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, and high levels of social and physical activity. The disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep variability are notable but may not independently translate to high depressive symptomatology without other significant contributing factors. Given the absence of strong indicators typically associated with high CES-D scores, such as very low self-esteem, high anxiety, significant perceived stress, or very low physical/social engagement, it is more likely that this participant falls within the lower half of the distribution.

Notably, the participant reports no time spent on video games or reading, and no time dedicated to sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data provides physiological and circadian rhythm insights. Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-Score = -1.23), suggesting irregular daily patterns. Intradaily variability is within the population average (Z-Score = 0.1). The participant's Mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours) is lower than the population average (Z-Score = -0.78), as is the amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-Score = -0.71), indicating reduced overall cardiovascular fluctuation. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is at 5:29 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly below the population average (Z-Score = -0.26). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significant deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-Score = 1.12; 4-5 AM, Z-Score = 0.69; 5-6 AM, Z-Score = 0.65), and a pronounced peak in the early evening (5-6 PM, Z-Score = 1.13), followed by a gradual decline. This pattern suggests potential disruptions in the normal diurnal heart rate variation, with periods of significantly lower heart rate during typical waking hours and elevated rates during nighttime and early evening hours. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 3 minutes, Z-Score = 1.08) and a relatively stable sleep start time (standard deviation of 72 minutes, Z-Score = -0.24). However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 01:03 AM. No daily naps were recorded.

The participant's CES-D score, though not explicitly provided, can be inferred to be in the upper half of the distribution. While some self-report measures like happiness and sleep quality appear favorable, the significantly low self-esteem score (Z-Score = 1.66) is a strong indicator often associated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the low interdaily stability (Z-Score = -1.23) in heart rate, combined with unusual hourly heart rate deviations, suggests potential physiological dysregulation that can accompany depression. The late sleep onset time, despite a long duration, might also point to sleep disturbances characteristic of depressed mood. The relatively weak correlations with CES-D scores across various measures do not provide a strong directional signal, but the confluence of low self-esteem and disrupted diurnal physiological patterns, coupled with the general understanding of CES-D metrics, suggests a likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology.

Self-report data reveal high levels of perceived stress (PSS Score = 27.0, Z-score = 1.47), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.28). Concurrently, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a high PSQI score (9.0, Z-score = 1.05), exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant disturbance. This subjective sleep disturbance is further supported by wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes (Z-score = -1.29), which is notably below average for the study population, and a high average number of daily naps (Z-score = 3.05). The median sleep start time is unusually late at 3:36 AM, with a substantial standard deviation in sleep start times (130 minutes, Z-score = 1.04), suggesting significant irregularity in sleep-wake patterns.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a high volume of passive entertainment, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = 0.64) and listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score = 1.6). While some correlation with CES-D exists for music listening (r=0.25), the time spent on these activities is considerable. Conversely, engagement in more active pursuits appears limited; reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score = -0.67), and exercise with others or sports occur infrequently (1-2 times a month for both, Z-scores of -0.17 and 0.25 respectively).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm analysis indicates reduced regularity. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is notably low (Value = 0.17, Z-score = -1.98), suggesting a lack of consistent daily patterning in cardiovascular activity. This is further reflected in a low Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value = 0.15, Z-score = -1.45), implying that daily physiological cycles are not strongly repeating. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is also lower than the population mean (Value = 65.7, Z-score = -1.13), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is reduced (Value = 6.5, Z-score = -1.38), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Examining the Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor, there are notable patterns of increased deviation in the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: 2.08, Z=2.07; 3-4 AM: -6.23, Z=1.6; 4-5 AM: -6.32, Z=1.95), potentially indicating disrupted sleep architecture or an altered physiological state during typical rest periods.

Overall, the convergence of high perceived stress, significant sleep disturbances (both subjectively and objectively), reduced engagement in restorative activities, and irregular physiological rhythms points towards a profile consistent with a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While self-esteem is within the average range (Score=37.0, Z=-0.17), and happiness is only slightly below average (Current=3.0, Z=-0.53), the prominent indicators of stress and sleep disruption, coupled with behavioral patterns often associated with withdrawal and low motivation, suggest a CES-D score likely in the upper half of the distribution.

Conversely, there is a notable elevation in anxiety proneness, as indicated by the STAI-Trait score (Z-score = 0.76), which is positively correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.81). Self-esteem is considerably lower than the study average (Z-score = -1.29), and this metric also shows a negative correlation with CES-D scores (r=-0.71). Health satisfaction is also below the mean (Z-score = -0.95), with a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.39).

Sleep data reveal a significant discrepancy between subjective and objective measures. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = 1.52), which is a strong predictor of elevated depressive symptoms (implied by correlation with CES-D). Objectively, the median sleep duration is considerably shorter than the population average (Z-score = -1.45), aligning with the subjective experience of poor sleep. The median sleep start time (03:56:30) is also notably late, contributing to a likely disrupted sleep-wake cycle. While the variability in sleep duration and start times are within the typical range for the population, the overall brevity and late initiation of sleep are significant factors.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological data indicates a relatively stable and regular circadian rhythm. The MESOR (mean heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly above the population mean (Z-score = 0.3), and the resting heart rate is also slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.34). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is lower than average (Z-score = -0.63), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Interdaily stability (0.48, Z-score = 0.58) and intraday variability (0.55, Z-score = 0.03) suggest a fairly consistent daily pattern in heart rate, and the autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.36, Z-score = 0.31) further supports the presence of a discernible daily rhythm. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is observed at 6:29 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal elevated heart rates during the late evening (9-11 PM, Z-scores = 1.20 and 1.06 respectively) and early morning hours (12-3 AM, Z-scores = 1.25, 1.67, and 1.30 respectively), with notable dips during the typical wakeful morning hours (6-9 AM). These patterns, particularly the late-night and early-morning heart rate elevation alongside the significant sleep disturbances and low self-reported happiness and self-esteem, are suggestive of an irregular sleep-wake cycle impacting physiological functioning. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, and exercise frequency is low, particularly for exercising alone and with others. Daily recreation habits indicate high engagement with listening to music (more than 4 hours) and socializing with friends (3-4 hours), alongside moderate TV/video watching and internet usage.

Considering the significant indicators of psychological distress, including high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and disturbed sleep quality, alongside objectively short sleep duration, it is likely that this participant experiences a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. The positive correlations of anxiety and disturbed sleep with CES-D scores, and the negative correlation of self-esteem, further support this interpretation. While perceived stress is low, this does not negate the impact of other psychological factors on overall depressive symptomatology. The physiological data, particularly the late-night and early-morning heart rate elevations, could be indicative of a dysregulated stress response or sleep-related issues contributing to a higher CES-D score.

17932,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"The participant presents with several self-reported psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant detailed examination in relation to depressive symptomatology. Notably, the participant reports a PSQI score of 13.0, significantly above the threshold for disturbed sleep (Z-score of 2.9), suggesting a considerable subjective impairment in sleep quality. This aligns with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score of 1.74), which, while objectively lengthy, may be qualitatively poor given the high PSQI score. Furthermore, the median sleep start time of 1:23 AM, coupled with a substantial sleep duration, points to a potentially disrupted circadian alignment. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is reported as 44.0 (Z-score of 0.82), which is elevated, indicating high self-worth. Conversely, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is reported at a score of 35.0 (Z-score of -0.62), falling within the ""not anxious"" classification, suggesting low levels of chronic anxiety. Perceived stress is moderate, with a PSS score of 18.0 (Z-score of -0.98). Interpersonal trust is reported at a score of 2.67 (Z-score of -1.1), indicating lower than average trust in others. Self-reported happiness is moderate, with a score of 3.0 (Z-score of -0.53). Health satisfaction is also reported as relatively low, with a score of 5.56 (Z-score of 0.97).

The participant's wearable-derived physiological and behavioral data indicate a relatively stable circadian rhythm, although with some specific deviations. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is 0.54 (Z-score of 1.08), suggesting a moderate degree of regularity in daily activity patterns. The Intradaily Variability is 0.37 (Z-score of -1.24), indicating low variability within the day, which, in conjunction with the high Interdaily Stability, suggests a relatively structured daily routine. The Autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.52 (Z-score of 1.65), further supporting a degree of temporal regularity in the heart rate signal. The Mesor is 66.57 (Z-score of -1.01), indicating a lower than average resting heart rate. The Amplitude of 12.61 (Z-score of 0.59) is within the typical range. The Acrophase at 5:12 PM suggests a peak in activity towards the late afternoon. The Resting Heart Rate of 48.65 (Z-score of -1.13) is notably low. Analysis of the Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM show Z-scores ranging from -0.84 to -1.53). Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during the late morning and afternoon, particularly between 11 AM-12 PM (Z-score of 1.99) and 4-5 PM (Z-score of 0.79), and evening hours such as 9-10 PM (Z-score of 1.05).

Considering the provided data, the participant demonstrates a complex profile. The significantly disturbed sleep quality (high PSQI score) alongside a late sleep start time and potentially long sleep duration are substantial indicators of disrupted sleep patterns, which are frequently associated with elevated depressive symptoms. While the participant reports high self-esteem and low trait anxiety, and moderate perceived stress, the subjective sleep quality is a strong counterpoint. The lower-than-average trust and relatively low health satisfaction also contribute to a potentially vulnerable psychological state. The physiological data, while indicating some regularity in daily patterns, show a pronounced reduction in heart rate during the early morning hours, potentially reflecting a deep or non-restorative sleep state, and notable heart rate elevations in the afternoon and evening, which could indicate periods of arousal or stress. The presence of several negative indicators, particularly the highly disturbed sleep and lower interpersonal trust, coupled with moderate CES-D scores in the general population (mean 13.31, median 11.0), suggests that this participant's combined profile likely places them in the upper half of the distribution for depressive symptoms. The strong correlation between PSQI score and CES-D (though not provided directly here, generally high PSQI is associated with higher CES-D) is a critical factor.

81420,25.0,0.8393782383419689,"The participant exhibits several notable characteristics across self-reported surveys and wearable-derived metrics. Psychologically, a high score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Z-score: 0.86) coupled with a low self-esteem score (Z-score: -1.01) suggests a tendency towards chronic anxiety and lower self-worth. This is further supported by a low health satisfaction score (Z-score: -1.11). While perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.38), the correlation with depressive symptoms is moderate (0.28). The participant reports moderate to high beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01), and engages in regular exercise alone (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07) and with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.53). Daily recreational habits include moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with a pronounced tendency towards longer periods of reading (Z-score: 1.3). Interpersonal trust is reported at a below-average level (Z-score: -0.46), with a weak negative correlation to depressive symptoms (-0.41).

Analysis of the wearable data reveals significant disruptions in circadian rhythm regularity. The participant demonstrates very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -0.99) and high Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.66), indicating a lack of consistent daily patterns in heart rate. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also low (Z-score: -0.36), further underscoring this irregularity. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate around which the rhythm fluctuates, is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.6) relative to the study population, and the Resting Heart Rate is also higher than average (Z-score: 0.53). The Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably low (Z-score: -0.74), suggesting a flattened daily heart rate variation. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am: -8.59, Z-score: 1.23; 4-5 am: -13.34, Z-score: 0.79), followed by a more pronounced elevation during the afternoon and early evening. Specifically, the 2-3 pm (10.77, Z-score: 0.69) and 5-6 pm (10.15, Z-score: -0.05) periods show considerable positive deviation from the mesor. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration that is very close to the population average (Z-score: 0.02), but a substantial standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.31) and a later median sleep start time (02:40:30) are observed, along with a slightly higher standard deviation in sleep start time. The PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score: 0.59), aligning with the observed sleep pattern irregularities. The low correlation coefficients between most wearable metrics and CES-D scores suggest that these physiological markers, while indicative of disrupted rhythms, do not strongly predict depressive symptom severity in this participant.

Considering the constellation of self-reported anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, and significantly disrupted circadian rhythm regularity, along with elevated perceived stress and lower health satisfaction, the overall pattern suggests a considerable burden of psychological distress. While the correlations with specific CES-D domains are not provided for direct interpretation, the confluence of these factors strongly indicates a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant's psychological profile, characterized by significant anxiety proneness and low self-worth, combined with objective indicators of disordered daily functioning (circadian rhythm instability, sleep disturbances), aligns more closely with the upper range of depressive symptom severity.

67709,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics derived from wearable technology. Notably, high perceived stress (Z-score 1.19) is accompanied by elevated anxiety proneness as measured by the STAI (Z-score 0.46), suggesting a tendency towards experiencing higher levels of stress and anxiety. Conversely, self-esteem is reported as lower than average (Z-score -0.73), which, in conjunction with moderate interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.14) and slightly lower than average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22), indicates a potentially negative self-perception and limited confidence in their physical well-being. Happiness levels are also slightly below the population average (Z-score 0.55).

Behaviorally, the participant reports minimal substance usage across all categories and engages in moderate exercise, predominantly with others (Z-score 1.23). However, there is a significant deviation in daily recreational habits, characterized by high internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and substantial listening to music (Z-score 1.13), while activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading are reported as infrequent or non-existent. This pattern suggests a preference for digitally mediated or auditory forms of engagement over more passive or cognitively demanding activities.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) and a generally lower mesor (Z-score -0.83) compared to the study population, suggesting a lower average cardiovascular activity baseline. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate some degree of instability in daily regularity, with lower than average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.24) and intradaily variability (Z-score -0.6), and a weak autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.12). This suggests a less structured daily rhythm. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pronounced peak in cardiovascular arousal in the late afternoon to early evening (5-6 PM, Z-score 2.76; 6-7 PM, Z-score 1.24), which is significantly higher than typical. This is followed by a gradual decline throughout the night.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally longer than average sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score 1.34) and a more variable sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score 1.65), suggesting less consistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is notably late (03:45:29), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score 0.33). The participant also reports a slightly higher than average frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score 0.82). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is within the disturbed sleep range (Score 6.0, Z-score -0.33), which is slightly better than the average poor sleep quality, but still indicative of some sleep difficulties.

The correlation between CES-D scores and several self-report measures is notable. Higher STAI scores are positively correlated with CES-D (0.82), indicating that greater anxiety proneness is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Lower self-esteem (r = -0.71), lower trust (r = -0.41), and lower happiness (r = -0.46) are also negatively correlated with CES-D, meaning that lower levels of these positive psychological states are associated with higher depressive symptom scores. Perceived stress shows a positive correlation (0.28), suggesting higher stress levels are linked to increased depressive symptoms.

Regarding wearable metrics, a higher resting heart rate (r = 0.2) and a higher mesor (r = 0.2) are weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting that a higher baseline cardiovascular activity might be associated with more depressive symptoms. Sleep duration standard deviation also shows a positive correlation (0.19), indicating that greater inconsistency in sleep duration is associated with higher CES-D scores. Mean daily naps have a positive correlation (0.21) with CES-D, suggesting that napping more is linked to increased depressive symptoms.

The CES-D population data indicates a median score of 11.0 and a 75th percentile of 17.25. Given the participant's elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, lower happiness, higher perceived stress, and tendency towards disrupted sleep patterns and a less stable circadian rhythm, alongside correlations suggesting these factors are associated with higher CES-D scores, it is plausible that this participant's depressive symptom burden falls within the upper half of the study population distribution. The combination of negative self-perceptions, heightened stress, and behavioral patterns that may not be conducive to robust mental well-being, along with physiological indicators of disrupted rhythm and sleep variability, points towards a potentially higher symptom burden.

Self-report data indicate a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of 0.27) and a high degree of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score of 0.26, bordering on the maximum score of 40). Perceived stress is elevated (PSS Z-score of 0.65), correlating positively with depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-reported happiness is lower than the population average (Z-score of -0.53), and trust in others is also slightly below average (Trust Z-score of 0.18). Health satisfaction is notably lower than average (Z-score of 0.55). Substance usage is minimal, with alcohol and drug use reported as less than 1-2 times a month or not at all. Exercise habits indicate a high frequency of exercising alone (Z-score of 1.07) but infrequent exercise with others or participation in sports. Daily recreational habits include substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.64) and moderate internet usage (Z-score of -0.49), with less time dedicated to reading or sedentary hobbies.

Analysis of wearable data reveals a disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep patterns. The participant demonstrates significantly low interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.99), indicating poor regularity in daily routines, and high intradaily variability (Z-score of 1.23), suggesting erratic fluctuations in activity throughout the day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably low (Z-score of -1.07), which can be indicative of blunted physiological responses. Sleep duration is significantly shorter than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -1.0) with high variability (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of -1.17), alongside a highly variable sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.75), with the median sleep start time occurring very late (01:28:30). The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score of -0.86) does not appear to compensate for the poor nighttime sleep. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor in heart rate shows pronounced elevations during the mid-afternoon (3-4 PM, Z-score of 1.99) and a notable dip during the evening (7-8 PM, Z-score of -1.7), potentially reflecting disrupted physiological regulation throughout the day.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's data points towards a profile that aligns more with the upper half of the CES-D score distribution. While some indicators like high self-esteem and low substance use might suggest resilience, the elevated perceived stress, lower self-reported happiness, and significantly disturbed sleep patterns (both duration and timing, with high variability) are strong correlates of depressive symptomatology. The poor interdaily stability and high intradaily variability in activity, coupled with a low amplitude in heart rate rhythm, further suggest a lack of structured daily functioning and potentially reduced physiological reactivity, both of which are commonly observed in individuals experiencing higher levels of depressive symptoms. The positive correlation between perceived stress and depressive symptoms, despite the low correlation with other specific variables, further supports this conclusion.

Self-reported anxiety (STAI) is within the normative range (Z-score -0.13), and self-esteem is also at a near-average level (Z-score -0.03). Similarly, interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5) and self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) are moderately elevated, suggesting positive social engagement and subjective well-being. Perceived stress is slightly above average (Z-score 0.38), aligning with a moderate correlation with depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also slightly elevated (Z-score 0.38). Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is on the higher side of the study population (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while recreational drug use is notably low (Z-score -0.31). Exercise frequency is generally low, particularly for exercising alone (Z-score -1.18). Daily recreational habits indicate minimal engagement in passive activities like watching TV, video games, and reading, while internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends show slightly lower than average engagement, all with negative Z-scores.

From a physiological perspective derived from wearable data, the participant demonstrates a circadian rhythm with a high mesor (Z-score 0.44) and amplitude (Z-score 0.88), indicating a generally robust daily physiological cycle. The acrophase occurs around 5:09 PM, suggesting a typical peak in activity within the late afternoon. Resting heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population average (Z-score 0.56). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower-than-average heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score -1.24) and a trend towards higher-than-average heart rate in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 5-6 PM (Z-score 0.77) and 6-7 PM (Z-score 1.1). Sleep statistics indicate a significantly longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score 1.45), with moderate variability. Sleep start times are notably late (median 1:37 AM) with moderate variability. The absence of naps and a low mean number of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) is also observed. Interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score 0.17), suggesting some disruption in daily rhythm regularity, while intraday variability is higher than average (Z-score 1.16), potentially reflecting increased physiological fluctuations throughout the day.

Considering the available data, the participant presents a complex profile. While self-reported measures of anxiety, self-esteem, trust, and happiness lean towards the lower end of depressive symptomology, the slightly elevated perceived stress and higher than average substance use, coupled with low exercise frequency, are potential risk factors. The physiological data reveals a highly variable pattern of heart rate deviation throughout the day, with significantly low heart rates in the morning and elevated rates in the evening. The late sleep onset and high median sleep duration, despite being a positive indicator in isolation, could be part of a disrupted circadian pattern. The increased intraday variability in heart rate, alongside moderately below average interdaily stability, suggests a less consolidated physiological rhythm. The positive correlations of CES-D score with perceived stress and negative correlations with self-esteem and happiness, although not overwhelmingly strong, suggest that any elevation in these self-reported measures would likely contribute to a higher CES-D score. Given the presence of elevated perceived stress, lower than average exercise, and some indicators of physiological dysregulation in terms of heart rate patterns and circadian rhythm stability, it is plausible that the participant's CES-D score would fall within the upper half of the study population distribution, indicating a moderate to elevated level of depressive symptoms.

Their STAI-Trait score suggests a generally low propensity for chronic anxiety, and their self-esteem score falls within the average range for the study population. They report moderate happiness levels and moderate perceived stress. Their health satisfaction is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.3, indicating a significant positive deviation from the study mean. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week, which is higher than the population average, though recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise habits include engaging in sports and exercising alone 1-2 times a week, and exercising with others three times a week or more, with the latter being a particularly strong positive deviation from the norm (Z-score of 1.23). Daily recreational activities show a preference for longer durations of socializing with friends (2-3 hours) and moderate internet usage, while time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, listening to music, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are relatively limited.

The participant’s wearable data reveals several notable patterns. Their circadian rhythm, as indicated by interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.08), demonstrates a high degree of regularity. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is also elevated (Z-score of 1.44), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in cardiovascular activity. Their resting heart rate is within the average range for the population. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a consistent pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2 AM to 8 AM, with Z-scores as low as -0.99), followed by a significant increase in heart rate deviation above the mesor during the afternoon and evening, peaking between 1 PM and 2 PM (Z-score of 1.83) and again in the late evening. This pattern suggests a robust diurnal variation in physiological arousal. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 46 minutes, which is slightly above average for the population. Importantly, the standard deviation for both sleep duration and sleep start time are notably low (Z-scores of -1.04 and -1.17, respectively), suggesting highly consistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is consistently late, around 1:37 AM. Napping behavior is reported as minimal.

Considering the provided data in relation to depressive symptomatology, several points are relevant. The participant's relatively low anxiety (STAI-Trait), average self-esteem, and moderate happiness are generally not indicative of elevated depressive symptoms. Their high health satisfaction is also a positive indicator. While perceived stress is moderate, it is not exceptionally high. Their consistent sleep patterns, despite a late start time, and above-average sleep duration do not strongly suggest the sleep disturbances often associated with depression. The lack of naps is also not a primary indicator of depression. The strong engagement in social activities and moderate exercise are also protective factors. The correlations between CES-D scores and some of these metrics are also instructive: higher self-esteem (-0.71) and higher happiness (-0.46) are negatively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting that improvements in these areas are associated with lower depressive symptoms, which this participant exhibits. While stress is positively correlated with CES-D (0.28), their perceived stress is not excessively high. Given these factors, the overall evidence points towards a participant with relatively lower depressive symptomatology.

29134,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile characterized by notable deviations in sleep patterns, psychological well-being, and physiological regulation. Self-reported data indicate a high level of perceived sleep disturbance, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 11.0, which falls at the 98th percentile of the study population (Z-score of 1.98). This subjective sleep quality is further corroborated by objectively measured sleep metrics from the wearable device, which reveal significant irregularities. Specifically, the participant displays a considerably high standard deviation in sleep duration (159 minutes, Z-score of 1.33) and a markedly elevated standard deviation in sleep start time (183 minutes, Z-score of 2.2). These findings suggest a substantially disrupted and inconsistent sleep schedule.

In terms of psychological self-assessments, the participant reports moderate levels of happiness (Z-score of 0.55) and relatively average levels of anxiety (STAI score of 38.0, Z-score of -0.33) and perceived stress (PSS score of 21.0, Z-score of -0.17). While self-esteem is slightly above average (Score of 39.0, Z-Score of 0.11), their reported interpersonal trust is also elevated (Score of 3.67, Z-Score of 0.83). These psychological measures, taken together, do not strongly point towards acute distress. However, the consistently elevated scores on measures related to sleep disruption warrant attention.

The participant's physiological data, derived from hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, reveal a generally consistent pattern with a mesor (mean heart rate level) at -0.56 standard deviations below the population mean, suggesting a slightly lower baseline heart rate. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is also lower than the population average (Z-score of -0.51), indicating a reduced diurnal variation. A notable observation in the hourly heart rate deviations is a tendency for lower-than-expected heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from 0.14 to 0.59), followed by higher-than-expected heart rates during late morning and afternoon hours (e.g., 11 AM-1 PM, with Z-scores of 1.25 and 0.92). This pattern may reflect a less robust physiological response to daily demands or a blunted stress reactivity during certain periods. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm is recorded at 5:06 PM, which falls within a typical range. Circadian rhythm metrics like interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.0) and intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.18) are close to population averages, suggesting that while sleep is disrupted, the overall daily rhythm of heart rate is not drastically irregular in its broader structure.

The correlation between CES-D score and various metrics provides additional context. The strongest negative correlations, indicating that higher values of these metrics are associated with lower CES-D scores, are observed for Self-Esteem (r=-0.71), Health Satisfaction (r=-0.39), and Trust (r=-0.41). Conversely, a positive correlation is noted for Perceived Stress (r=0.28), although this correlation is not particularly strong. The most salient negative correlation is with Self-Esteem, suggesting that higher self-worth is associated with lower depressive symptoms. The significant elevation in PSQI (poor sleep quality) and the highly disrupted sleep start times and durations, coupled with the negative correlation with self-esteem, are the most compelling indicators related to depressive symptomatology. While happiness is above average, and anxiety and stress are average to below average, the pervasive sleep issues and the strong link between self-esteem and depressive symptoms suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology.

Considering the available data, particularly the high PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, the significant variability in sleep start times and durations, and the moderate negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, there is evidence suggesting a potential for elevated depressive symptomatology. The population mean CES-D score is 13.31 with a standard deviation of 9.62, placing the 50th percentile at 11.0 and the 75th percentile at 18.0. The participant's PSQI score of 11.0 is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.98), and is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"". The standard deviations for sleep duration and start time are also significantly elevated. While other psychological measures like happiness, anxiety, and stress are not overtly indicative of high depression, the pervasive sleep disturbance and its known link to depression, along with the moderate negative correlation with self-esteem, point towards a higher likelihood of being in the top half of the CES-D distribution. The strong indicators of poor sleep quality and quantity, combined with a trait that is negatively correlated with depression (self-esteem), suggest that this participant may experience a greater burden of depressive symptoms.

Specifically, time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28), playing Video Games (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47), and engaging in Sedentary Hobbies (2-3 hours, Z-score: 2.01) are all above average and show positive correlations with depressive symptoms, ranging from 0.11 to 0.13. The participant also reports listening to music for more than 4 hours daily (Z-score: 2.06), which has a positive correlation (0.25) with depressive symptoms. Notably, substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with low Z-scores indicating this is less frequent than the study population, and these have very low correlations with depressive symptoms. Exercise habits are robust, with the participant exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports three times a week or more, indicated by high Z-scores for these activities (1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively). However, the correlation with depressive symptoms for these positive health behaviors is weakly negative (-0.09 to -0.23), suggesting they do not significantly mitigate depressive symptoms in this individual.

Wearable data reveals significant disruptions in the participant's circadian rhythm and sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score: -0.52), which is below the population median and shows a weak negative correlation (-0.0) with depressive symptoms. The sleep start time is consistently late, with a median start time of 22:44:58, and a standard deviation of 99 minutes, suggesting irregular sleep onset. The mesor (average heart rate) of 72.85 bpm (Z-score: -0.15) is slightly below average, with a resting heart rate of 54.6 bpm (Z-score: -0.42), indicating a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with Z-scores between -1.28 and -2.94), and a significant surge in heart rate during the morning hours (e.g., 6-8 AM, with Z-scores between 2.66 and 4.77). This pattern suggests a potential difficulty in transitioning from sleep to wakefulness. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate some irregularity, with interdaily stability at 0.42 (Z-score: 0.09) and intradaily variability at 0.7 (Z-score: 1.09), with a weak negative correlation for both (-0.0 and -0.06 respectively) with depressive symptoms. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, is consistently around 2:19 PM.

The presence of high perceived stress, elevated anxiety proneness, and disturbed sleep, combined with above-average engagement in certain sedentary leisure activities and below-average sleep duration, strongly suggests a pattern consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. While self-esteem is relatively high and physical activity is robust, these factors do not appear to fully offset the indicators of distress. The CES-D population data indicates a mean of 13.29 and a median of 11.0. Given the convergence of several risk factors for depression, particularly elevated perceived stress and anxiety, and the significant disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms, it is likely that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

The participant's self-reported data suggests a generally positive psychological and lifestyle profile. They report low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.33), indicating a stable trait, and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.26), with a score at the upper limit of the scale. Their perceived stress levels are also relatively low (Stress Z-score: -0.17). Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (PSQI Z-score: -1.26), suggesting minimal sleep disturbances. Social trust is moderately low (Trust Z-score: -1.1), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average for the population (Happy Z-score: 0.55). Health satisfaction is also above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.55). Regarding lifestyle, the participant engages in regular exercise, specifically exercising alone three or more times a week (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07), and consumes no alcohol or recreational drugs. Their daily recreational habits are balanced, with moderate engagement in reading, listening to music, and socializing with friends, while limiting screen time for television and video games.

The wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics provide further insights into the participant's daily patterns. Their circadian rhythm appears moderately stable, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 1.49. However, Intradaily Variability is relatively low (Z-score: -1.24), suggesting a less dynamic hourly heart rate variation throughout the day, which might be associated with lower physiological arousal during waking hours. The mesor (average heart rate) is below the population average (Mesor Z-score: -0.84), and the resting heart rate is also notably lower (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.99), which could reflect a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.87), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate despite the lower overall mesor. The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, is recorded at 4:28 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal periods of significantly lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM deviation: -24.54, 4-5 AM deviation: -28.41), followed by a noticeable increase in heart rate during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 11 AM-12 PM deviation: 14.66, 1-2 PM deviation: 16.9, 4-5 PM deviation: 16.03), and then a gradual decrease in the evening. This pattern aligns with typical circadian activity cycles. Sleep duration averages around 6 hours and 56 minutes (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.31), which is slightly below the population average but within a reasonable range. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also below average, suggesting consistent sleep durations. The sleep start time is consistently around midnight (Median Sleep Start Time: 00:57:45), with relatively consistent start times across nights. There are no reported naps.

While many self-report measures indicate a positive psychological state, there are some indicators that may indirectly relate to depressive symptomatology. The low Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability in heart rate, along with a lower than average mesor and resting heart rate, could suggest a reduced level of physiological engagement or energy. The strong negative correlation between self-esteem and the CES-D score (0.71) suggests that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, trust (0.41) and happiness (0.46) also show negative correlations with CES-D, indicating that higher levels of trust and happiness are linked to fewer depressive symptoms. Although the participant's self-esteem is high, their moderate levels of social trust and slightly above-average happiness, coupled with the physiological data suggesting lower baseline arousal and less dynamic daily fluctuations, warrant consideration when interpreting their overall CES-D score.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The provided data presents a mixed picture when considering potential depressive symptom burden. On one hand, the participant reports high self-esteem, low perceived stress, good subjective sleep quality, and engages in healthy lifestyle behaviors such as no substance use and regular exercise. These factors are generally associated with lower CES-D scores. Furthermore, their STAI-Trait anxiety score is within the ""not anxious"" classification. However, the wearable data indicates a lower overall physiological arousal (low mesor and resting heart rate) and less variability in heart rate throughout the day (low Intradaily Variability). This could be interpreted as a potential reduction in overall energy or vitality, which can be associated with depressive symptoms. The moderate-to-low scores in social trust, despite high self-esteem, could also be a contributing factor. The moderate negative correlation of trust and happiness with CES-D suggests that these factors, if lower, could be associated with higher CES-D scores. While the participant's sleep duration is slightly below the population average, it is reported as subjectively good, and the consistency in sleep start times suggests good sleep hygiene. The strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D score is a significant indicator; a high self-esteem score would typically suggest a low CES-D score.

Considering the balance of evidence, the high self-esteem, low stress, good subjective sleep, and healthy lifestyle behaviors are strong indicators of a lower depressive symptom burden. While the physiological data suggests a generally lower level of arousal, this is not definitively indicative of elevated depressive symptoms in isolation, especially given the strong positive self-report indicators. The participant's self-reported data leans towards a profile consistent with lower depressive symptomatology.

49086,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"The participant's self-reported data indicate a complex psychological profile. Anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, are within the non-anxious range (Z-score of -1.02), with a strong positive correlation (0.81) suggesting that higher trait anxiety is associated with higher CES-D scores. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively high (Z-score of 1.1), exhibiting a moderate negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores, implying that greater self-worth is linked to lower depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.38) with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is characterized as disturbed (Z-score of -0.33), with a slight negative correlation (-0.03) with CES-D, suggesting poorer sleep quality may be associated with higher CES-D scores. Happiness levels are below average (Z-score of -0.53), showing a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) with CES-D, indicating that lower self-reported happiness is associated with higher CES-D scores. Interpersonal trust is above average (Z-score of 0.83), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) to CES-D, suggesting greater trust is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score of -0.7), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.4) to CES-D.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports infrequent alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a month, Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week), with minimal correlation to CES-D scores. Notably, the participant engages in no regular exercise, either alone or with others, or sports, with weak negative correlations to CES-D. Daily recreational activities are varied; sedentary habits like watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies are relatively high (Z-scores of 0.64 and 0.82 respectively), with weak positive correlations to CES-D. Internet usage and listening to music are moderate (Z-scores of 0.18 and 0.67 respectively), with weak positive correlations. Socializing with friends occurs with moderate frequency (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95), showing a negligible correlation. Reading and playing video games are engaged in less frequently (Z-scores of 0.32 and -0.56 respectively), with negligible correlations.

Wearable data reveals several interesting physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. Interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.16) and intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.18) of heart rate are slightly below the population average, suggesting a marginally less regular daily rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is below average (Z-score of -0.61), indicating a lower baseline heart rate, with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also below average (Z-score of -0.57), implying a reduced daily fluctuation in heart rate, with a weak negative correlation to CES-D. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:43 PM). Resting heart rate is below average (Z-score of -0.22), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significant deviations during the late night and early morning hours. Specifically, the periods of 2-3 AM (Z-score of 0.77), 3-4 AM (Z-score of 0.33), 4-5 AM (Z-score of 0.44), and 5-6 AM (Z-score of 0.28) show elevated positive deviations, suggesting a period of increased physiological arousal or a less suppressed heart rate during these early morning hours, particularly notable given the late median sleep start time. Conversely, the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 12-1 PM, 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM) show the highest positive deviations, indicating periods of higher activity or arousal during the day.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.15) and has a negligible correlation to CES-D. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also slightly above average (Z-score of 0.13), suggesting some variability in sleep length. A notable finding is the very late median sleep start time of 02:19:30, with a sleep start time standard deviation that is not significantly different from the population average (Z-score of -0.11). This late sleep onset, combined with the above-average sleep duration, suggests a potential disruption in the typical sleep-wake cycle, with a very late bedtime and potentially delayed wake-up. The low frequency of naps (Z-score of -0.08) is consistent with this.

Overall, the participant presents with a pattern of lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and higher perceived stress, which are moderately associated with higher CES-D scores. Subjective sleep quality is also a concern, with a weak association to CES-D. The lack of physical activity is notable, along with increased sedentary leisure activities. The physiological data reveals a lower resting heart rate and mesor, and a less pronounced daily heart rate variation. The most striking finding from the physiological data is the significant deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours, suggesting potential dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles and physiological arousal during typical sleep times. The very late median sleep start time further corroborates this. While several factors point towards potential challenges, the generally low anxiety and above-average self-esteem are mitigating factors. Given the moderate negative correlations between self-esteem, happiness, trust, health satisfaction and CES-D, and the weak positive correlations between stress and sedentary activities with CES-D, combined with the significantly late sleep onset, the overall picture suggests a moderate burden of depressive symptoms. The PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" and the late sleep onset are particularly concerning, as sleep disturbances are a core component of depressive symptomatology. Considering the CES-D population statistics (mean 13.34, 50th percentile 11.5), the combination of low self-esteem, low happiness, high perceived stress, disturbed sleep, and a significantly delayed sleep schedule suggests the participant likely falls within the upper half of the distribution for depressive symptoms.

95490,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"This analysis synthesizes self-report, behavioral, and physiological data to interpret depressive symptomology as measured by the CES-D scale within a university student population. The participant exhibits a moderate level of anxiety, with a STAI score of 47, placing them above the study population mean (Z-score of 0.56). This elevated anxiety is associated with a positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting a potential link between trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem is lower than average, with a score of 34 and a Z-score of -0.59, which correlates negatively with CES-D scores (-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem may be associated with higher depressive symptomatology. The participant reports relatively low happiness (Current score of 3.0, Z-score of -0.53), with a negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.46), aligning with the expectation that lower happiness is linked to increased depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is slightly elevated (Score of 23.0, Z-score of 0.38), with a moderate positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.28), suggesting that higher stress may contribute to higher CES-D scores. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score of 3.89, Z-score of -0.28), with a negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.39), implying that lower health satisfaction might be associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral patterns indicate moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. These substance use patterns show minimal correlation with CES-D scores. Exercise habits reveal frequent solo exercise ('Three times a week or more', Z-score 1.07) but infrequent exercise with others. Daily recreation includes moderate TV/video watching and internet usage, with significant time spent listening to music and socializing with friends, while reading and playing video games are minimal. The relatively high frequency of social interaction (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95) shows a negligible correlation with CES-D scores, while listening to music, a solitary activity often associated with mood regulation, has a moderate positive correlation (0.25).

Wearable data reveals a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Value of 61.4, Z-score of 0.39) which correlates positively with CES-D scores (0.19). The mesor of the heart rate rhythm is also slightly elevated (Value of 77.1, Z-score of 0.43), also with a positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.19). However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is lower than average (Value of 8.34, Z-score of -0.79), with a negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.1). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates significantly low interdaily stability (Value of 0.23, Z-score of -1.48) and slightly high intradaily variability (Value of 0.6, Z-score of 0.39). The low interdaily stability, which represents the regularity of daily patterns, has a negligible correlation with CES-D scores (0.0). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value of 0.19, Z-score of -1.12), suggesting a disrupted daily rhythm, with minimal correlation to CES-D scores (0.03). Sleep statistics indicate a sleep duration slightly shorter than the population average (Median duration of 6 hours 56 minutes, Z-score of -0.3), with a minimal negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.0). Sleep start times are notably irregular, with a median start time of 01:11:34 and a standard deviation of 101 minutes, which has a moderate positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.22).

The participant exhibits elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, and lower happiness, all of which are generally associated with higher depressive symptomatology. The perceived stress level is also moderately elevated. While social engagement is relatively high, sleep patterns show marked irregularity and a tendency towards shorter duration, which can be indicative of depressive states. The disrupted circadian rhythm, as evidenced by low interdaily stability and autocorrelation, further supports the presence of significant physiological dysregulation that is often observed in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. The positive correlation between resting heart rate and CES-D score, alongside the slightly elevated mesor and lower amplitude, suggests a cardiovascular system that may be less resilient and less able to adapt to daily demands. Considering the convergence of self-reported psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and disrupted physiological rhythms, the overall pattern suggests a moderate to high burden of depressive symptoms.

90079,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics. Self-report measures indicate a generally low level of anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.33) and relatively high self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score of -0.59), suggesting a stable personality structure with a positive self-regard. However, their reported happiness level is moderately low (Happiness Z-score of -0.53), and they perceive a moderate level of stress (Stress Z-score of 0.65). Interpersonal trust is notably low (Trust Z-score of -1.42), indicating potential difficulties in social relationships. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (PSQI Z-score of 0.13), with a median sleep duration of just under 6 hours, which is significantly lower than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -1.59). This is further evidenced by a high intradaily variability in heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-score of 1.44), suggesting fragmented and irregular physiological patterns throughout the day. The participant's exercise habits are consistent with moderate engagement, participating in individual and group exercise 1-2 times per week, but not in sports. Recreational activities are predominantly passive, with limited engagement in video games or internet usage beyond 1-2 hours, and no reported watching of TV/videos/movies or reading.

The wearable data reveals several patterns of potential significance. The participant exhibits significantly low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -1.65) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score of -1.54), indicative of a disrupted and irregular circadian rhythm. This is supported by a relatively low amplitude in their heart rate rhythm (Amplitude Z-score of -1.37), suggesting a dampened physiological oscillation. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs late in the afternoon (4:54 PM), which, in conjunction with the overall low stability, may suggest a misalignment of their internal biological clock. Notably, the mean aggregate deviation from mesor during nighttime hours (1-6 AM) shows significant negative deviations, particularly between 3-4 AM (Z-score of 0.57) and 4-5 AM (Z-score of 1.06), which, while deviating from the average, might reflect periods of reduced physiological arousal during these early morning hours. However, during the day, particularly from 12 PM to 3 PM, positive deviations are observed, suggesting periods of higher than average heart rate relative to their mesor. Their resting heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 0.89).

Given the significant indicators of disrupted sleep patterns, low interdaily stability, and low sleep duration, coupled with a moderate perceived stress level and lower self-reported happiness, the participant's data suggests a tendency towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The strong negative correlations between low trust, low happiness, and CES-D score, as well as the positive correlation between perceived stress and CES-D, further support this interpretation. While self-esteem is relatively high, it does not fully offset the constellation of other risk factors. The overall pattern suggests that the participant likely experiences a considerable burden of depressive symptoms, placing them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

22842,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"This participant presents a complex profile characterized by elevated anxiety, notably poor subjective sleep quality, and unusual patterns in their daily physiological rhythms. The STAI-Trait score of 46, with a z-score of 0.46, indicates a level of chronic anxiety that is slightly above the population mean, and this score shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores. This suggests that higher trait anxiety is associated with greater depressive symptomatology in this study. Complementing this, the PSQI score of 10.0, with a significant z-score of 1.52, clearly places the participant in the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification and is indicative of poor subjective sleep quality. This measure also shows a positive correlation with CES-D scores, reinforcing the link between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is relatively moderate, with a score of 36 and a z-score of -0.31, indicating it is somewhat below the population average, and this has a notable negative correlation with CES-D, suggesting lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Reported happiness is also somewhat below average (z-score of -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D. Perceived stress is near the population average (z-score of 0.1), with a weak positive correlation.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a high frequency of exercising alone (""Three times a week or more,"" z-score 1.07), which is above the population average. However, engagement in exercising with others and sports is infrequent. Substance usage, including beer, wine, liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported as less than minimal or not at all, with z-scores indicating below-average usage for alcohol and recreational drugs. Daily recreation habits reveal a pattern of high engagement in video games (z-score 1.71), moderate internet usage, and limited time spent listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Notably, listening to music and reading are engaged in with considerably less frequency than the population average, while video game usage is substantially higher.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data indicates a generally lower mesor (mean heart rate level, z-score -0.63) and amplitude (daily heart rate variation, z-score -0.67) compared to the population, suggesting a potentially dampened cardiovascular response. The resting heart rate (z-score -0.47) is also below average. The circadian rhythm metrics show low interdaily stability (z-score -0.9) and moderate intradaily variability (z-score -0.6), suggesting a less regular daily physiological pattern. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate, is recorded at 6:03 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant variability, with pronounced negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -17.86 at 5-6 AM, -18.89 at 6-7 AM). Conversely, there are substantial positive deviations during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 14.56 at 6-7 PM). These patterns, particularly the pronounced dips in heart rate during the early morning, may reflect atypical sleep or activity patterns.

Sleep statistics highlight a longer than average median sleep duration (7 hours 51 minutes, z-score 0.83) but a significantly more variable sleep start time (standard deviation 164 minutes, z-score 1.79), suggesting irregularity in sleep timing. The high Z-score for naps (2.4) indicates frequent napping behavior, which can be associated with disturbed sleep and depressive symptoms. The positive correlations of sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability with CES-D scores further emphasize the detrimental impact of inconsistent sleep patterns on mood.

Considering the overall evidence, the participant's elevated anxiety, significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality, lower self-esteem, below-average happiness, and highly irregular sleep timing, coupled with frequent napping and a less stable circadian rhythm, strongly suggest a considerable burden of depressive symptoms. The positive correlations observed between trait anxiety, poor sleep quality, and sleep timing variability with CES-D scores provide robust support for an elevated CES-D score. While exercise frequency is high, other behavioral and physiological indicators lean towards a more symptomatic presentation.

Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is within a non-anxious classification, and the Z-score suggests it is below the population mean. Similarly, self-esteem scores are moderate, with a Z-score indicating it is slightly above the population average. Perceived stress levels are also moderate, with a slightly below average Z-score, suggesting appraisals of stress are not elevated. Interpersonal trust is notably low, indicated by a significant negative Z-score, suggesting a tendency towards suspicion or difficulty in trusting others. Self-reported happiness is moderately low, with a negative Z-score. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average, with a negative Z-score.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate social drinking (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week) and abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are mixed, with infrequent solo exercise but more regular exercise with others and participation in sports 1-2 times a week, the latter being a relatively high frequency for this participant. Daily recreational habits indicate low engagement with passive screen time activities like watching TV and video games, and moderate internet usage. Notably, this participant reports not listening to music or engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies, which are significantly below population averages. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, which is a positive social engagement.

Wearable data reveal a well-structured circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability and moderate Intradaily Variability, suggesting a consistent daily pattern. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also high, further supporting this regularity. The Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) is slightly above average, and the Amplitude is notably high, indicating a greater range of heart rate variation throughout the day relative to the population. The Acrophase occurs in the mid-afternoon, which is within a typical range. Resting heart rate is within the population norm. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor. There are periods of marked positive deviation during the late morning and early afternoon (10 AM - 12 PM, 12 PM - 1 PM, 3 PM - 4 PM, 6 PM - 7 PM, 9 PM - 10 PM), and also late evening (7 PM - 8 PM), indicating periods of higher physiological arousal. Conversely, significant negative deviations are observed during early morning hours (1 AM - 6 AM), consistent with sleep, and also in the late evening (11 PM - 12 AM), suggesting periods of lower arousal.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally longer than average sleep duration, with a positive Z-score. However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is above the threshold for disturbed sleep, with a moderate positive Z-score, suggesting subjective sleep quality issues despite longer duration. The standard deviation for sleep duration is within population norms, as is the standard deviation for sleep start time, suggesting relative consistency in sleep timing. There is a very low frequency of napping.

Considering the totality of the data, the positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81) is a significant indicator. While the participant's current STAI score is within the ""not anxious"" classification and below average Z-score, the strong correlation suggests that any increase in anxiety would strongly predict increased depressive symptoms. The negative correlation between Self-Esteem and CES-D (-0.71) is also strong. The participant's self-esteem is slightly above average, which would generally be protective against depressive symptoms. However, the low interpersonal trust (Z-score of -1.74) is a concerning factor, as low trust can be associated with social isolation and rumination, often co-occurring with depressive symptoms. The moderate but low self-reported happiness (Z-score of -0.53) also leans towards the depressive spectrum. The PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, despite longer duration, is a common correlate of depression. The high amplitude of heart rate variation, while indicative of a strong circadian rhythm, could also reflect periods of heightened physiological activation that might, in conjunction with other factors, contribute to a higher symptom burden. Given the strong positive correlation of anxiety and the strong negative correlation of self-esteem with CES-D, any fluctuation in these domains, even if currently moderate, could significantly elevate the CES-D score. The lower than average happiness further supports a potential for higher depressive symptomatology.

Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (Score 26.0, Z-Score -1.71), which is a significant correlate with depressive symptomatology. Subjective well-being appears compromised, with a low happiness score (Current 2.0, Z-Score -1.61). Interpersonal trust is also reported as relatively low (Score 4.0, Z-Score 1.47), which can be associated with social withdrawal and isolation often seen in depression.

Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise habits, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports, are consistently reported as 1-2 times a week, indicating a regular but not exceptionally high level of physical activity. Daily recreational habits show a marked preference for listening to music for 2-3 hours daily (Z-Score 1.13), with lower engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and sedentary hobbies. Notably, time spent socializing with friends is reported as only 31 minutes an hour, which is on the lower end of the observed spectrum for this activity, potentially reflecting reduced social engagement.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data provide further insights. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Value 0.49, Z-Score 0.67) and higher intradaily variability (Value 0.69, Z-Score 1.02), suggesting a somewhat disrupted daily pattern in physiological activity. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly elevated (Value 76.76, Z-Score 0.38) relative to the population mean, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also higher (Value 14.01, Z-Score 1.04), indicating a larger fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Resting heart rate is within a normal range (Value 60.2, Z-Score 0.24). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 8 AM, with the most pronounced negative deviations observed between 7 AM and 8 AM (Z-score -1.15). Conversely, the participant shows elevated heart rate deviations in the evening, with particularly significant positive deviations occurring between 7 PM and 8 PM (Z-score 2.24) and 6 PM and 7 PM (Z-score 1.81), coinciding with the reported acrophase of 5:17 PM. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 37 minutes, which is slightly longer than average (Z-Score 0.54), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:54:00), with a moderate standard deviation in start time, suggesting some variability in sleep onset. Mean daily naps are minimal (Value 0.12, Z-Score 0.61).

Considering the self-reported measures of high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, low trust, and disturbed sleep, alongside moderate perceived stress, there is substantial evidence pointing towards elevated depressive symptomatology. While the participant engages in regular, albeit moderate, exercise and has a preference for music listening, the reduced social interaction and potentially disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep patterns are concerning. The significant negative deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours and pronounced increases in the evening could reflect an altered physiological response to daily demands or internal states, which can be associated with depression. Given the strong negative correlations of low self-esteem, low happiness, and low health satisfaction with CES-D scores, these factors contribute significantly to an expected higher CES-D burden.

52302,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported psychological traits and behavioral patterns, alongside objectively measured physiological and sleep data. Self-reported anxiety (STAI) is notably high (Z-score of 0.17, correlation of 0.82 with CES-D), suggesting a disposition towards experiencing anxiety. Conversely, self-esteem is within the population average (Z-score of 0.11) and demonstrates a moderate negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71), indicating that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is moderately above average (Z-score of 0.5) and shows a weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41). Self-reported happiness is also above average (Z-score of 0.55) with a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). Perceived stress levels are slightly below average (Z-score of -0.17) with a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by PSQI, is within the average range (Z-score of -0.33) and classified as 'Disturbed Sleep', with a weak negative correlation to CES-D. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.13) with a weak negative correlation to CES-D. Substance use across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as 'Not at all', with negative Z-scores indicating usage significantly below the population average. Exercise frequency is reported as '1-2 times a week' for exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports, with Z-scores ranging from 0.32 to 0.91, indicating moderate to high engagement relative to peers, all showing weak negative correlations with CES-D. Daily recreational habits reveal a considerable engagement in sedentary activities, with high Z-scores for watching TV/videos/movies (1.28), video games (1.71), and internet usage (0.85), all showing weak positive correlations with CES-D. Socializing with friends also indicates a high time commitment (1.74 Z-score) with a negligible correlation to CES-D. Reading and sedentary hobbies show lower engagement.

Wearable data reveals specific patterns in circadian rhythm and sleep. Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-score of -0.33), suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is also notably low (Z-score of -0.95), which, when combined with low interdaily stability, may indicate a less dynamic or responsive physiological system. The mesor, or average heart rate level, is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.28). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average (Z-score of 0.5), suggesting a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate, though the acrophase (peak heart rate time) is in the late afternoon (5:17 PM), which is typical. Resting heart rate is low (Z-score of -0.67), indicating good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows distinct patterns: significant deviations below the mesor are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM, 8-9 AM), potentially reflecting periods of deeper rest or reduced physiological arousal. Conversely, the participant exhibits notable positive deviations from the mesor during the afternoon (1-3 PM, 2-3 PM, 3-4 PM) and late evening (9-10 PM, 10-11 PM), indicating periods of higher physiological activity or arousal. Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration (8 hours 6 minutes, Z-score of 1.14), which is above average and shows a negligible correlation with CES-D. However, the standard deviation for sleep duration and sleep start time are moderately elevated (Z-scores of 0.51 and 0.43 respectively), suggesting some variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is early morning (01:07:59). The mean number of daily naps is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.7).

Considering the provided CES-D population statistics (Mean: 13.32, SD: 9.62, 50th percentile: 11.5), this participant's data indicates a potential for a higher burden of depressive symptoms. While self-esteem and happiness are relatively high, and substance use is minimal, the presence of elevated anxiety (STAI), significant engagement in sedentary screen-based activities, and specific patterns in heart rate variability and circadian rhythm metrics warrant consideration. The low interdaily stability and intradaily variability in heart rate, coupled with the pronounced late-night/early-morning dips and afternoon/late-evening peaks in heart rate deviation from the mesor, could be indicative of underlying dysregulation that is often associated with depressive symptomatology. The positive correlations, albeit weak, between screen time and CES-D, and the slightly elevated perceived stress, further contribute to this possibility. Although sleep duration is adequate, the variability in sleep onset and duration might also be a contributing factor. The combined picture suggests a profile that leans towards the higher end of the CES-D distribution.

46418,18.0,0.7461139896373057,"This participant exhibits several self-reported characteristics that may be relevant to their psychological state and depressive symptomology. Their STAI-Trait score of 38.0, with a Z-score of -0.33, suggests a tendency towards low trait anxiety, indicating they do not generally perceive themselves as prone to anxiety. This is further supported by a high self-esteem score of 38.0 (Z-score: -0.03), signifying a generally positive self-regard, and a strong negative correlation (r = -0.71) between self-esteem and CES-D score, implying that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Their reported happiness score of 4.0 (Z-score: 0.55) is above average, also correlating negatively with CES-D (r = -0.46). Conversely, health satisfaction is relatively low with a score of 2.67 (Z-score: -1.2), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.39). Perceived stress is at an average level (Score: 22.0, Z-score: 0.1) with a slight positive correlation to CES-D (r = 0.28). Interpersonal trust is also slightly below average (Score: 3.0, Z-score: -0.46) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.41).

Regarding sleep, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z-score: 1.98), placing them in the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification. This high PSQI score, indicative of poorer subjective sleep quality, correlates positively with CES-D scores, suggesting a link between sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms. While their median sleep duration of 7 hours and 44 minutes is within a typical range, the Z-score of 0.69 indicates it's slightly longer than the study average. The standard deviation of sleep duration (64 minutes, Z-score: -0.84) suggests a relatively consistent sleep duration, and the standard deviation of sleep start time (52 minutes, Z-score: -0.68) indicates a fairly regular sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Value: 0.0, Z-score: -0.86) is also noted.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in regular exercise, particularly with others (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more', Z-Score: 1.23) and sports (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more', Z-Score: 1.58), both exhibiting strong positive correlations with higher frequency of exercise. There is a moderate positive correlation between exercising alone and CES-D scores (r = -0.09), suggesting increased solitary exercise is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week, with high Z-scores indicating this is more frequent than the average participant, yet these show very weak negative correlations with CES-D. Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits show a tendency towards higher engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28), while more active or engaged leisure pursuits like listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading are done for shorter durations (15 minutes or less or 31 minutes an hour). Internet usage is also reported as 1-2 hours. The correlations for most daily recreation habits with CES-D scores are weak and mostly near zero, with the exception of internet usage (r=0.25) and listening to music (r=0.25) showing a slight positive association.

Wearable data reveals some interesting physiological patterns. The participant's mesor (average heart rate around their circadian rhythm) is slightly elevated (Value: 78.2, Z-Score: 0.58), and their amplitude (the range of their heart rate variation) is significantly higher than average (Value: 15.07, Z-Score: 1.39), suggesting a more pronounced diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. The resting heart rate is average (Value: 57.8, Z-Score: -0.04). Circadian rhythm regularity metrics show a lower than average interdaily stability (Value: 0.53, Z-Score: 1.0), indicating less consistency in their daily rhythm, and a significantly lower intradaily variability (Value: 0.3, Z-Score: -1.73), suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate within a 24-hour period than expected. The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:55 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant deviations during the evening hours. Notably, the period between 5-6 PM shows the largest positive deviation (26.09, Z-score: 2.27), followed by 6-7 PM (22.76, Z-score: 1.78), and 9-10 PM (15.4, Z-score: 1.28). These indicate periods of elevated cardiovascular arousal during these times. The correlations between these hourly deviations and CES-D scores are generally weak, with a few slightly positive correlations in the evening hours and slightly negative correlations in the early morning hours. Interdaily stability has a weak negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.01), while intradaily variability has a weak negative correlation (r = -0.05).

The participant's CES-D score would likely place them in the bottom 50% of the study population. This assessment is based on several indicators pointing towards lower depressive symptomatology. Notably, the participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI-Trait Z-score: -0.33), high self-esteem (Z-score: -0.03), and higher than average happiness (Z-score: 0.55). These self-reported traits are consistently associated with lower CES-D scores, as indicated by the strong negative correlations for self-esteem (r = -0.71) and happiness (r = -0.46). While sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 1.98), this metric has a positive correlation with CES-D, suggesting poorer sleep is associated with higher depression, but other factors may be more influential in this case. The participant also exhibits regular social and sports-based exercise, which is generally protective against depressive symptoms. Conversely, while there are periods of elevated heart rate in the evenings, the overall correlations of wearable metrics with CES-D are weak. The overall profile suggests a lower burden of depressive symptoms, despite significant sleep disturbance.

93002,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"This participant presents a complex profile with several notable behavioral and physiological characteristics that may inform their CES-D score. Self-report data indicates lower than average self-esteem (Z-score: -0.87) and a tendency towards higher perceived stress (Z-score: 0.1), although these are moderate deviations. Happiness is reported at a slightly below average level (Z-score: -0.53), with a corresponding moderate negative correlation with CES-D. Anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI-Trait, is within the average range (Z-score: -0.13), but shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), suggesting that higher anxiety is strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in this population. Interpersonal trust is also slightly below average (Z-score: -0.14), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D. Subjective sleep quality is reported as poor, with a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (Z-score: 1.05), a factor often associated with depressive symptomatology. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, with significantly low Z-scores, indicating no contribution to potential depressive symptoms in this domain. Exercise frequency is limited, particularly for solo exercise and sports (Z-scores: -0.43 and -1.09 respectively), while exercise with others is more regular (Z-score: 0.53). Daily recreational habits reveal substantial internet usage (Z-score: 0.85) and moderate engagement in listening to music, with limited time spent on activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals several physiological patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is notably lower than average (Z-score: -1.18), and the Mesor, a measure of circadian rhythm average, is also below population average (Z-score: -1.24). This suggests a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by interdaily stability and intradaily variability, falls within the average range (Z-scores: 0.67 and 0.24 respectively), with a slightly higher than average autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 0.81), suggesting some degree of temporal regularity in heart rate patterns. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal a distinct pattern of reduced cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.69 to -2.65). Conversely, there are notable peaks in cardiovascular activity during the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 7-9 PM (Z-scores: 2.16 and 0.76 respectively), and a significant positive deviation during the early afternoon (12-1 PM, Z-score: 1.61). These patterns indicate a potentially delayed or shifted diurnal rhythm of physiological arousal. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of approximately 6.5 hours, which is below average (Z-score: -0.88), and a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: 0.43). The median sleep start time is very late (1:16 AM), with a considerable standard deviation, suggesting irregular sleep timing. The presence of a moderate number of daily naps (Z-score: 1.21) further supports a potentially disrupted sleep-wake cycle.

Considering the cumulative evidence, the participant exhibits several indicators associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Lower self-esteem, higher perceived stress, and lower reported happiness, while not extreme, contribute to a profile suggestive of negative affect. The strong positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D, coupled with average anxiety levels, is a significant factor. Furthermore, the reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI) and objectively observed shorter and more variable sleep durations, along with a late and irregular sleep start time, are potent markers for depressive symptomatology. While physiological metrics like resting heart rate and Mesor are lower, the disrupted diurnal pattern of heart rate, with suppressed activity during crucial sleep hours and elevated activity during the evening, may reflect a dysregulated physiological state that often accompanies depression. The limited engagement in certain sedentary recreational activities and exercise, alongside increased internet usage, may also reflect a withdrawal from more engaging activities. Given the confluence of self-reported distress, significant sleep disturbances, and physiological dysregulation, the participant's CES-D score is likely to fall within the upper half of the study population distribution.

Subjective reports of happiness are also below average (Z-score of -0.53), and there is a notable concern for health satisfaction (Z-score of 0.88), suggesting a general negative appraisal of well-being. Sleep quality is a significant concern, with a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (Z-score of 1.05). This subjective poor sleep quality is further supported by objective sleep data, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes (Z-score of -0.94), which is below the population average. The variability in sleep start times (Z-score of -0.50) and duration (Z-score of -0.67) suggests a lack of regularity in sleep patterns.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in sedentary activities. Internet usage is exceptionally high (Z-score of 2.19), and reading time is also notably extended (Z-score of 4.24). In contrast, social interaction with friends is around average (Z-score of 0.16). Exercise habits are mixed, with frequent solitary exercise (Z-score of 1.07) but infrequent exercise with others or participation in sports. Substance use, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is reported as ""not at all,"" with significantly low Z-scores across these categories.

Physiologically, the participant presents with a higher-than-average mesor (mean heart rate) and resting heart rate (Z-scores of 1.14 and 1.17, respectively), indicating a generally elevated baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable rhythm in terms of interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.67) but a moderate level of intraday variability (Z-score of 0.32). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pronounced elevation in the late evening hours, particularly between 9-10 PM (Z-score of 3.28) and 10-11 PM (Z-score of 5.94), and also a significant dip during the early afternoon (2-3 PM, Z-score of -2.26). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is noted at 6:44 PM.

The available data suggest that this participant likely has a CES-D score in the top 50% of the study population. The elevated scores in anxiety (STAI), perceived stress, and disturbed sleep (PSQI) are all strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores in the literature and within this dataset. Furthermore, lower self-esteem and lower self-reported happiness are also consistent indicators of elevated depressive symptomatology. While objective sleep duration is shorter than average, this is often a consequence of or contributing factor to depression, rather than a direct indicator of low depressive symptoms. The elevated resting heart rate and mesor could suggest physiological arousal often associated with anxiety, which frequently co-occurs with depression. The pronounced late-evening heart rate elevation is also notable and warrants further consideration in the context of a holistic assessment of depressive symptom burden.

89142,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"The participant exhibits a profile characterized by elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, and a notable tendency towards sedentary behaviors, with limited engagement in exercise or sports. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 48.0, with a Z-score of 0.66, indicates proneness to chronic anxiety, a finding that is positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.82). Conversely, a low self-esteem score (32.0) with a Z-score of -0.87, and a negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71), further suggests a psychological disposition potentially amenable to depressive symptomatology. Objective measures of daily routine show a significant tendency towards prolonged engagement in video games (Z-score 1.71) and reading (Z-score 2.28), while activities such as exercising alone or with others, and participating in sports, are reported as ""Not at all"" frequent (Z-scores -1.93 and -1.58, respectively). This pattern of limited physical activity, coupled with high screen time for entertainment and cognitive engagement, may contribute to a less active lifestyle.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a relatively low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z-score -1.49), suggesting a potentially lower baseline level of physiological arousal compared to the study population. The mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is also low (60.11 bpm, Z-score -1.89). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -21.4, Z-score -1.23; 3-4 AM: -24.56, Z-score -1.3). Following this trough, there is a noticeable increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor starting around 7-8 AM (7-8 AM: 4.43, Z-score 1.81), with peak positive deviations occurring in the mid-morning (9-10 AM: 16.47, Z-score 1.69) and early evening (6-7 PM: 18.57, Z-score 1.05). The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is recorded at 3:57 PM, which is within the typical diurnal range. However, the intradaily variability of heart rate is notably low (0.44, Z-score -0.74), suggesting a less dynamic cardiovascular rhythm throughout the day, which could reflect reduced activity levels or a blunted physiological response to daily fluctuations. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 50 minutes, which is significantly shorter than typical recommendations (Z-score -1.68), and a relatively low sleep duration standard deviation, suggesting consistency in short sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late, around 1:01 AM, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is moderate, indicating some variability but a general pattern of delayed sleep onset.

Overall, this participant presents with a constellation of traits and behaviors that align with an increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms. The high anxiety and low self-esteem, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle and insufficient sleep duration, are significant risk factors for elevated CES-D scores. The physiological data, while not directly indicative of depression, reflect a pattern of reduced cardiovascular variability and a late sleep onset, which can be associated with disrupted circadian rhythms and mood disturbances. Considering the strong positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D, and the inverse correlation with self-esteem, these psychological factors are weighted heavily. The limited physical activity and reduced sleep duration also contribute to a profile suggestive of poorer mental well-being.

Concurrently, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (RSES score of 31.0, Z-score = -1.01) and a reduced sense of interpersonal trust (Trust score of 2.67, Z-score = -1.1), both of which are negatively correlated with the CES-D score (r = -0.71 and r = -0.41, respectively). These findings suggest that lower self-worth and mistrust may be associated with a greater burden of depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are above average (PSS score of 24.0, Z-score = 0.65), with a positive correlation to the CES-D score (r = 0.28), indicating that higher perceived stress may also contribute to increased depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Score of 5.44, Z-score = 0.88), with a negative correlation to the CES-D score (r = -0.39), implying that lower satisfaction with physical health might be linked to higher depressive symptoms.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in significant physical activity, exercising alone and with others and participating in sports at a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58, respectively). These activities show weak negative correlations with CES-D scores, suggesting they may have a protective effect against depressive symptoms.

Physiological data from wearable devices present a complex picture. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Value of 0.65, Z-score = 1.99), indicating a highly regular daily rhythm, with a weak negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.0). However, intradaily variability is low (Value of 0.34, Z-score = -1.45), with a weak negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.06). The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Value of 71.55, Z-score = -0.33), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (r = 0.19). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly higher than average (Value of 15.84, Z-score = 1.64), with a negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.1). The resting heart rate is lower than average (Value of 49.4, Z-score = -1.04), with a positive correlation to CES-D (r = 0.19). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals pronounced dips during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, Z-scores ranging from -1.54 to -2.36), suggesting a period of significant physiological deceleration. Conversely, the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 2-3 PM, 6-7 PM) show notable peaks in heart rate deviation from the mesor (Z-scores of 2.62 and 2.15, respectively), indicating periods of higher physiological arousal during these times. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of ""6 hours 14 minutes"" (Z-score = -1.18), which is shorter than average and negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.0). The median sleep start time is late, at 00:54:29, with a standard deviation of 34 minutes, suggesting some variability in sleep timing.

Considering the self-reported measures, the elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, low trust, high perceived stress, and low health satisfaction, all of which have significant correlations with the CES-D score, are strong indicators of elevated depressive symptoms. While the participant engages in healthy behaviors like frequent exercise, the strong negative correlations of self-esteem and trust with CES-D, and the positive correlation of anxiety and stress, collectively point towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The sleep duration being shorter than average also contributes to this picture. Although physiological measures show some regularities, the overall pattern of self-reported psychological distress, coupled with some sleep and heart rate metrics, suggests a significant level of depressive symptomatology.

The participant's CES-D score is likely to be in the top 50% of the study population. This is inferred from the strong negative correlations between CES-D and self-esteem (r = -0.71), trust (r = -0.41), and health satisfaction (r = -0.39), along with a strong positive correlation with anxiety (r = 0.81) and a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (r = 0.28). These self-report measures, which are often strongly linked to overall depressive symptomatology, indicate a constellation of traits and experiences commonly associated with elevated depression. Although some behavioral and physiological metrics are less strongly correlated or even show protective trends (e.g., exercise), the weight of evidence from the psychological constructs suggests a higher CES-D score. The relatively short sleep duration (Z-score = -1.18) further supports this conclusion, as sleep disturbances are a common component of depressive symptomatology.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in regular solitary exercise (Exercised Alone Frequency Z-score: 1.07), exceeding the population average. However, exercise with others and participation in sports are less frequent. There is a notable absence of substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs all with negative Z-scores), and a similarly low engagement in screen-based leisure activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games, as well as general internet usage. Conversely, reading is a more prevalent activity, exceeding the population average. Socializing with friends occurs at a moderate frequency.

Wearable data reveals specific patterns in circadian rhythm and activity. The interdaily stability of the participant's heart rate rhythm is somewhat low (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.41), suggesting some irregularity in daily patterning. Conversely, intradaily variability is high (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.51), indicating substantial fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly above the population mean (Mesor Z-score: 0.17), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also slightly elevated (Amplitude Z-score: 0.07). The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the early evening (6:27 PM). The resting heart rate is below the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.33). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of significantly elevated heart rate relative to baseline during late evening and night (e.g., 10-11 PM with a Z-score of 2.46, 11 PM-12 AM with a Z-score of 0.95), and also during the mid-afternoon (3-4 PM with a Z-score of 1.38). Conversely, there are pronounced dips in heart rate deviation in the late morning and early afternoon hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a slightly longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.47), with a standard deviation suggesting a more consistent sleep duration compared to the population (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.34). The median sleep start time is in the early morning hours (00:31:59), with a moderate degree of variability in start times. Napping frequency is very low.

Overall, the participant presents with a profile characterized by low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and low perceived stress, yet also reports low happiness and significant dissatisfaction with their physical health. Behaviorally, they abstain from substance use and engage in solitary exercise and reading, but have limited social and screen-based leisure activities. Physiologically, their circadian rhythm exhibits high intraday variability and some evening/nighttime heart rate elevations, alongside a lower resting heart rate. While many self-report measures suggest positive psychological functioning, the lower happiness score and health dissatisfaction, coupled with the high intraday variability in heart rate and elevated heart rate during sleep hours, warrant further consideration in relation to CES-D symptomatology. The CES-D population has a mean of 13.33 and a 50th percentile of 11.5. The correlation between CES-D and Trust is -0.41, with a Z-score of -0.46, suggesting lower trust is associated with higher CES-D. Similarly, the correlation with Happy is -0.46, and with Health Satisfaction is -0.4, indicating lower happiness and health satisfaction are associated with higher CES-D scores. The negative correlation with Self-Esteem (-0.71) also suggests that lower self-esteem would be associated with higher CES-D. The positive correlation with Stress (0.28) suggests higher perceived stress is associated with higher CES-D. Considering these relationships, the participant's lower scores on happiness and health satisfaction, along with lower trust and self-esteem, which are all correlated with higher CES-D, suggest a tendency towards elevated depressive symptoms.

77789,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that may inform their overall CES-D score. Self-reported anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI, is notably high (Z-score = 0.17), correlating positively with CES-D (r=0.81). Conversely, self-esteem is lower than the population average (Z-score = -0.31) with a negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also lower than average (Z-score = -0.44), with a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.28). Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score = -0.86) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39). Subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Z-score = -0.33), with a negative correlation to CES-D (r=not provided, but generally higher PSQI is associated with higher CES-D).

Behaviorally, the participant reports infrequent engagement in activities typically associated with positive affect and social connection. Exercise frequency is low, particularly exercising with others (Z-score = -1.58) and sports (Z-score = -1.09). Daily recreation habits show minimal engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music. Internet usage is moderate (16-30 minutes, Z-score = -1.16), while socialising with friends is also reported as limited ('31 minutes an hour', Z-score = -0.62). Notably, reading is reported at a higher than average frequency (Z-score = 1.3), but this does not appear to be strongly correlated with CES-D. Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, and recreational drugs, is generally at or below population norms.

Wearable data reveals a less regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability of heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-score = 0.67), suggesting less consistent daily patterns. Intradaily variability is also lower than average (Z-score = -0.39), which, in conjunction with the lower interdaily stability, could indicate flatter daily physiological profiles. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs at 4:00 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated relative to the population mean (Z-score = 1.25), with a higher than average Mesor (Z-score = 1.26). This suggests a generally higher baseline physiological arousal. Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals the most significant positive deviations in the mid-morning, particularly between 8-9 AM (Z-score = 1.71), and the most significant negative deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z-score = 0.04, 4-5 AM: Z-score = 0.44, 5-6 AM: Z-score = 0.1, 6-7 AM: Z-score = 0.11). This pattern suggests a blunted response to typical daily activity peaks and troughs. Sleep duration is shorter than average (Median Sleep Duration: '6 hours 32 minutes', Z-score = -0.8), with a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.49), indicating inconsistency. The median sleep start time is late at 01:19:14 AM, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is relatively low (Z-score = -0.45), suggesting a consistent but late sleep schedule. There is no evidence of napping (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-score = -0.86).

Considering the available data, the participant presents with elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, and disturbed sleep, all of which are factors often associated with higher CES-D scores. While perceived stress is lower, this may be confounded by other factors. The low engagement in social activities and exercise, coupled with a shorter and inconsistent sleep duration, further supports the possibility of elevated depressive symptomatology. The wearable data, particularly the less stable daily rhythms and elevated resting heart rate, may reflect physiological stress or dysregulation that can accompany depressive states. The positive correlation of STAI with CES-D and negative correlation of self-esteem with CES-D are significant indicators. The overall pattern of findings, including self-reported psychological distress and behavioral patterns, suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

88882,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"The participant exhibits several self-reported characteristics that may be indicative of psychological well-being. Their STAI-Trait score of 28.0 falls within the ""not anxious"" classification, with a notable Z-score of -1.31, suggesting significantly lower trait anxiety compared to the study population. This is further supported by a high Self-Esteem score of 46.0 (Z-Score: 1.1), indicating elevated self-worth. Similarly, their perceived stress score is relatively low (18.0, Z-Score: -0.98). Self-reported happiness is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.64. Interpersonal trust is also above average (3.67, Z-Score: 0.83), and health satisfaction is moderately positive (5.0, Z-score: 0.55). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high, with all reported GPAs at or near 4.0. In terms of lifestyle, substance usage of beer is higher than average (Z-Score: 1.01), while wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drug usage are below average. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is above the population average, with a particularly high frequency of exercising alone (Z-Score: 1.07). Daily recreational habits lean towards lower engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and a moderate engagement in internet usage and listening to music. Socializing with friends and reading are engaged in minimally or not at all.

Wearable-derived data reveals patterns in sleep and physiological regulation. The participant's median sleep duration is notably short at 5 hours and 57 minutes, which is 1.53 standard deviations below the population mean, suggesting significant sleep deprivation. This is accompanied by a lower than average Mesor (resting heart rate) of 65.04 bpm (Z-Score: -1.22) and a lower than average resting heart rate of 47.35 bpm (Z-Score: -1.28). The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a less regular daily pattern, as evidenced by low Interdaily Stability (0.34, Z-Score: -0.57) and high Intradaily Variability (0.63, Z-Score: 0.6). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (0.23, Z-Score: -0.78), further suggesting a disrupted circadian rhythm. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show pronounced elevations during the late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 1-2 AM (Z-Score: 3.1) and 8-9 PM (Z-Score: 1.34), alongside significant dips in heart rate deviation during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-Score: -0.58). This pattern, coupled with the short sleep duration and disrupted circadian metrics, suggests potential physiological dysregulation. The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep, aligning with the wearable data.

Considering the comprehensive analysis of the available data, the participant presents with several indicators that suggest a potentially lower burden of depressive symptoms. Their self-reported measures of anxiety, perceived stress, and self-esteem are all favorable, indicating positive psychological traits. Furthermore, high self-reported happiness and trust contribute to a picture of good mental well-being. While sleep duration is significantly reduced and there are signs of disrupted circadian rhythm and physiological regulation, these factors do not directly correlate strongly with higher CES-D scores in the provided data and may represent other underlying challenges or lifestyle choices. The strong academic performance also suggests a capacity for functioning. Given the overall trend of positive self-reports and the weak or negative correlations between these favorable traits and CES-D scores, it is most likely that the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the bottom half of the study population.

19245,26.0,0.844559585492228,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns. Self-report data indicates elevated levels of anxiety, with a STAI score of 55.0, placing them at a Z-score of 1.35, suggesting a proneness to chronic anxiety. Concurrently, perceived stress is also high, with a PSS score of 27.0 (Z-score 1.47). In contrast, self-esteem is slightly below average, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.45), and self-reported happiness is notably low at 2.0 (Z-score -1.61). Interpersonal trust is also significantly diminished, with a score of 2.17 (Z-score -2.07). These psychological indicators collectively suggest a state of heightened negative affect and low self-worth.

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer 1-2 times a week and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month, with higher than average frequency for beer consumption (Z-score 1.01). Recreational drug usage is infrequent. Exercise habits include exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), suggesting a generally active lifestyle in this domain. Daily recreational habits reveal a significant portion of time dedicated to listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64), and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95). Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18), while video game usage is notably absent (Z-score -0.56). Reading and other sedentary hobbies occupy less time.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by heart rate, shows a moderate Mesor of 66.42 (Z-score -1.03) and a typical amplitude of 10.08 (Z-score -0.23), with an acrophase occurring in the early evening (6:21 PM). Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.31, Z-score -0.82), suggesting a less regular daily pattern in cardiovascular activity. Intradaily variability is also below average (0.51, Z-score -0.25). The resting heart rate is notably low at 49.6 (Z-score -1.02). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, significant deviations above the mesor are observed during late evening hours, particularly between 10-11 PM (20.73, Z-score 2.25) and 11 PM-12 AM (16.74, Z-score 1.98), suggesting periods of elevated physiological arousal. Conversely, the participant exhibits significant negative deviations from the mesor during early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, -21.04, Z-score -0.49; 5-6 AM, -21.7, Z-score -0.49; 6-7 AM, -21.82, Z-score -0.63; 8-9 AM, -22.05, Z-score -1.73), indicating periods of reduced cardiovascular activity during the typical waking period.

Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score 1.14), with a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (155 minutes, Z-score 1.23). The median sleep start time is very late (02:38:30), with a substantial standard deviation (125 minutes, Z-score 0.92), suggesting significant variability in sleep timing. The presence of a mean of 0.27 daily naps (Z-score 2.27) further points to potential sleep disturbances. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13), which is considered clinically significant as it exceeds the threshold of 5. The correlation analysis reveals moderate negative correlations between CES-D score and self-esteem ( -0.71), trust (-0.41), and happiness (-0.46), suggesting that lower levels of these positive psychological constructs are associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Conversely, there is a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28). The correlations for most wearable metrics and substance/activity measures are weak.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant presents with several indicators suggestive of elevated depressive symptomatology. The low self-esteem, low happiness, significantly low interpersonal trust, and high perceived stress, coupled with pronounced anxiety, are all strong indicators of psychological distress. The erratic sleep patterns, including a very late and variable sleep start time, and a high frequency of naps, alongside a PSQI score indicative of disturbed sleep, further contribute to this picture. While some aspects of their behavior, such as exercise frequency and social engagement, appear relatively robust, they are overshadowed by the psychological and sleep-related challenges. The low interdaily stability in heart rate suggests a lack of rhythmicity in daily physiological functioning, which can be associated with depressive states. Given the significant negative correlations between CES-D and self-esteem, happiness, and trust, and the positive correlation with stress, it is likely that these factors contribute to a higher CES-D score. The presence of significant anxiety and perceived stress further supports this.

83748,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret depressive symptomology as measured by the CES-D scale. The participant reports low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.71) and relatively high self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score of 1.52, noting that higher scores indicate greater self-esteem, which contradicts the provided interpretation). Conversely, self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score of 1.64), suggesting a positive subjective emotional state. Perceived stress is within the average range for the population (Z-score of -0.71). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score of 6.0, above the common threshold of 5 for clinically significant disturbance, and a Z-score of -0.33). This aligns with the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 54 minutes, which is below average for the study population (Z-score of -0.35), and a high variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.93, indicating greater consistency than average). Interdaily stability of daily activity patterns is lower than average (Z-score of -0.33), suggesting less regularity in overall daily routines.

Physiological data from the wearable indicates a lower than average mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours, Z-score of -0.62) and a below-average amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-score of -0.17), suggesting a blunted daily fluctuation in heart rate. The resting heart rate is also slightly lower than the population average (Z-score of -0.34). Examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals pronounced periods of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z-score -0.63, 4-5 AM: Z-score -0.53, 5-6 AM: Z-score -0.65). Conversely, there are significant peaks in heart rate deviation during the evening, particularly between 5-6 PM (Z-score 1.69) and 6-7 PM (Z-score 2.67), as well as late evening (10-11 PM: Z-score 1.68 and 11 PM-12 AM: Z-score 3.51). This pattern, alongside the disturbed sleep metrics, may indicate a disrupted circadian rhythm. Exercise habits are robust, with frequent engagement in exercising alone, with others, and in sports (all Z-scores above 1.0), suggesting a potentially protective behavioral factor. However, daily recreational habits show low engagement in activities such as watching TV, video games, listening to music, and socializing with friends (Z-scores largely negative, particularly for socializing with friends at -2.2), with moderate internet usage (Z-score 0.18).

Considering the overall data, several factors point towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The disturbed sleep quality, shorter than average sleep duration, and highly variable sleep start times are significant indicators often associated with depression. While self-reported happiness and low anxiety are positive indicators, they may not fully capture the depth of underlying depressive states. The blunted circadian heart rate rhythm (lower mesor and amplitude) and the unusual evening/late-night heart rate spikes, juxtaposed with very low heart rates during the early morning, suggest a dysregulation that can be linked to mood disorders. Although the participant engages in regular exercise, which is generally beneficial for mental health, this may not be sufficient to counteract the negative impacts of sleep disturbances and potential circadian misalignment. The low engagement in social activities and passive entertainment could also contribute to feelings of isolation or anhedonia, common in depression. The negative correlation between higher happiness scores and CES-D, alongside the positive correlation for stress, suggests that even with self-reported happiness, there's a potential for underlying issues.

Given the presence of disturbed sleep, potentially disrupted circadian rhythm, and low engagement in certain social and leisure activities, which are all strongly associated with higher CES-D scores, it is likely that this participant falls within the top 50% of the study population for depressive symptom burden.

Concurrently, self-esteem is within the average range (Z=0.26), but the negative correlation (r=-0.71) with depressive symptoms suggests that lower self-esteem is associated with higher CES-D scores. Perceived stress is slightly below the population mean (Z=-0.17), yet it shows a positive correlation (r=0.28) with depressive symptoms. Subjective health satisfaction is notably lower than average (Z=-0.78), with a moderate negative correlation (r=-0.39) suggesting that poorer health satisfaction is associated with higher CES-D scores. Happiness levels are also below the mean (Z=0.55), with a negative correlation (r=-0.46) indicating that lower happiness is linked to elevated depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Z=0.5) but demonstrates a weak negative correlation (r=-0.41) with depressive symptoms. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is consistently below population averages (Z-scores ranging from -0.11 to -0.55), with negligible correlations to CES-D scores. Exercise frequency across all categories (exercised alone, exercised with others, sports) is significantly below population averages, with Z-scores for frequency ranging from -1.09 to -1.93, showing weak negative correlations to CES-D. Daily recreational habits indicate limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z=-0.62) and internet usage (Z=-1.16), while time spent playing video games (Z=0.2), listening to music (Z=-0.26), socializing with friends (Z=-1.41), reading (Z=-0.67), and engaging in sedentary hobbies (Z=0.23) fall within or below average ranges. Of these, only internet usage shows a slight positive correlation (r=0.25) with depressive symptoms.

The participant's sleep patterns, as measured by wearable data, reveal a median sleep duration that is below the population average (Z=-0.46), with a significant positive correlation (r=0.2) between higher variability in sleep duration and higher CES-D scores. The median sleep start time is notably late, occurring at approximately 1:28 AM (Z= -0.06 for standard deviation), with minimal variability in sleep start time (Z=-0.06). Mean daily naps are negligible (Z=-0.02). The participant's heart rate data, analyzed through cosinor and non-parametric measures, shows a higher-than-average Mesor (Z=1.13) and Amplitude (Z=1.69), suggesting generally elevated cardiovascular activity and a wider diurnal variation. Resting heart rate is close to the population average (Z=-0.15). Interdaily stability of heart rate is below average (Z=0.58), with a weak negative correlation (r=-0.0) to CES-D. Intradaily variability is also below average (Z=-1.38), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is observed in the late afternoon/early evening (5:43 PM). Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significant deviations during nighttime and early morning hours, with the largest negative deviations occurring between 3-4 AM (Z=-1.35) and 4-5 AM (Z=-1.05), suggesting a period of reduced physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, a substantial positive deviation is observed between 7-8 PM (Z=2.29), followed by consistently elevated deviations in the evening hours (e.g., 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM), indicating heightened cardiovascular activity during these periods, which could be indicative of disrupted sleep-wake cycles or stress responses.

Based on a holistic review of the available data, the participant presents with a pattern of elevated depressive symptoms. This is supported by several self-reported measures including higher anxiety (STAI), lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and lower health satisfaction, all of which have shown correlations with higher CES-D scores. Furthermore, the participant exhibits significantly reduced engagement in physical activity and below-average sleep duration, coupled with a pronounced disruption in the diurnal pattern of heart rate, characterized by significant nocturnal and early morning hypoarousal followed by elevated evening and nighttime arousal. While some metrics like interpersonal trust and perceived stress are not as strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptoms, the convergence of multiple risk factors, including psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological dysregulation, strongly suggests a higher burden of depressive symptomatology. Considering the population's CES-D distribution (50th percentile at 11.0), these combined indicators point towards a CES-D score likely falling within the upper half of the distribution.
