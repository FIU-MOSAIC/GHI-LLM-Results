44869,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that likely influence their sleep quality. Subjectively, they report a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 22.0, Z-score of 0.9), which correlates positively with their PSQI score (0.49). Conversely, their self-esteem is at the upper limit of the scale (40.0), which is associated with better sleep quality (correlation of -0.36). Anxiety levels are within a non-anxious range (STAI score of 39.0, Z-score of -0.23), with a neutral correlation to PSQI. While their overall happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53), their trust in others is also moderately low (Z-score of -0.46). Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55).

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, which is aligned with a lower Z-score for these activities. Exercise frequency is low, particularly for exercising with others (Z-score of -1.58), and moderate for exercising alone (Z-score of -0.43). Daily recreational habits indicate a significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 1.91) and listening to music (Z-score of 1.13), as well as substantial internet usage (Z-score of 0.85). Notably, sedentary hobbies occupy more than four hours daily (Z-score of 3.19), suggesting a largely inactive lifestyle outside of potentially scheduled activities. The correlation of these sedentary habits with PSQI is low, indicating these specific activities do not strongly predict sleep quality in this dataset.

Physiologically, as measured by the wearable, the participant presents with a high resting heart rate (Value of 78.4, Z-score of 2.41). The mesor, representing the average 24-hour heart rate, is also notably elevated (Value of 88.34, Z-score of 1.97), suggesting a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activity. The intradaily variability of heart rate is high (Value of 0.71, Z-score of 1.16), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. This is further reflected in the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor, which shows the most pronounced negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 am with -6.56, 3-4 am with -8.86, 4-5 am with -10.83), suggesting a potential dysregulation in heart rate patterns during sleep or the pre-sleep period. The acrophase, the peak heart rate time, is reported as 5:09 PM. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is relatively low (Value of 7.97, Z-score of -0.91), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the population average. Interdaily stability, a measure of rhythm regularity across days, is slightly above average (Value of 0.43, Z-score of 0.17), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also slightly above average (Value of 0.35, Z-score of 0.22), indicating some degree of daily regularity in their heart rate patterns, despite the high intradaily variability.

Sleep statistics reveal a long median sleep duration (8 hours 26 minutes, Z-score of 1.55) and a high variability in sleep duration (193 minutes, Z-score of 2.09). The median sleep start time is late (00:59:59), and there is significant variability in sleep start times (157 minutes, Z-score of 1.63). The absence of reported daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) is also noted. The positive correlations between sleep duration variability, sleep start time variability, and PSQI score suggest that inconsistency in sleep timing and duration is associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely falls into the **top 50%** of the study population in terms of their PSQI score, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The participant exhibits a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score 0.9), which has a substantial positive correlation (0.49) with the PSQI score. While their self-esteem is high (which correlates negatively with PSQI), the presence of depressive symptoms is a stronger indicator of potential sleep disturbance in this context.

Furthermore, the wearable data reveals significant irregularities in the participant's sleep patterns. A high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 2.09) and sleep start time (Z-score 1.63) are positively correlated with PSQI, suggesting that inconsistent sleep habits are a key contributor to poor sleep quality. The late median sleep start time (00:59:59) also points towards a disrupted sleep schedule. The physiological data indicates a high resting heart rate and mesor, along with high intradaily variability in heart rate, particularly during nighttime hours, which can be indicative of underlying physiological stress or arousal that negatively impacts sleep. Although the interdaily stability and autocorrelation suggest some daily regularity, the pronounced intradaily variability and late sleep start times overshadow these measures in predicting overall sleep quality. The lack of naps, while seemingly positive, does not counteract the other indicators of poor sleep.

Considering the confluence of elevated depressive symptoms, significant sleep schedule variability, and physiological signs of arousal during sleep periods, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score would place them in the upper half of the distribution, signifying poorer sleep quality.

92552,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological rhythms that may influence their sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate moderate levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.37) and a tendency towards low mood, as suggested by a relatively neutral CES-D score (Z-score: 0.18) and a tendency towards higher stress (Z-score: -0.17). Their self-esteem is notably high (Z-score: 0.82), and they report a moderate level of happiness (Z-score: 0.55). While overall health satisfaction is relatively low (Z-score: -0.78), the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor: 1-2 times a week) and reports no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are characterized by infrequent participation in individual exercise and sports (1-2 times a week or month respectively), with even less frequent engagement in exercising with others. Daily recreation is predominantly sedentary, with minimal time spent on activities like watching TV, video games, internet usage, or listening to music, and a complete absence of reading or engaging in sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals a distinct pattern in their diurnal heart rate variation. The participant's resting heart rate is relatively low (48.8 bpm, Z-score: -1.11), suggesting good cardiovascular conditioning. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates significant deviations from the mesor during the night and early morning hours. Specifically, there are substantial positive deviations between 12 AM and 5 AM, with the most pronounced being between 2 AM and 3 AM (Z-score: 4.03) and 1 AM and 2 AM (Z-score: 2.92). Conversely, during late morning and early afternoon hours (10 AM to 12 PM), there are notably negative deviations from the mesor, indicating lower than average heart rate activity during these periods. Circadian rhythm metrics show relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.24), suggesting some irregularity in their daily rhythms, while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.32). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 8:48 PM, which is within a typical evening range.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average sleep duration (Median: 7 hours 49 minutes, Z-score: 0.79), coupled with a high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 174 minutes, Z-score: 1.66). Their sleep onset time is considerably late, with a median start time around 3:48 AM. This late sleep onset is also characterized by moderate variability (Standard Deviation: 94 minutes, Z-score: 0.25). The participant also reports a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Mean: 0.22, Z-score: 1.75).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents several indicators that, when considered holistically, suggest their PSQI score may fall within the upper half of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality.

Evidence for a potentially high PSQI score (top 50th percentile) includes the significantly late median sleep start time (approximately 3:48 AM) and the substantial variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time. Late bedtimes and inconsistent sleep schedules are known contributors to poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports a higher-than-average frequency of daily naps, which can disrupt nighttime sleep patterns. The pronounced deviations in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, particularly the elevated activity between 1 AM and 5 AM, could reflect physiological arousal or disruption during their sleep period, aligning with potential sleep difficulties. The low interdaily stability in heart rate also suggests an irregular daily rhythm, which can negatively impact sleep.

Conversely, there is limited evidence to strongly support a low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile). While their absolute sleep duration is longer than average, this is counterbalanced by the late sleep onset and high variability, which often negate the benefits of simply spending more time in bed. Their resting heart rate is notably low, which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular health, but does not directly correlate with subjective sleep quality in this context. The self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, and happiness are relatively neutral, and while stress is slightly elevated, these psychological factors do not strongly point towards definitively good sleep.

Considering the significant late sleep onset, high sleep duration variability, frequent napping, and the physiological patterns observed in heart rate during the night, the overall evidence leans towards a PSQI score that would place the participant in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality compared to the average.

73158,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as indicated by significantly lower than average Z-scores for STAI (-1.71) and CES-D ( -1.38) respectively. This aligns with a high self-esteem score (50.0, Z-score 1.66), which is notably above the study population's mean. Happiness levels are also reported as high (Z-score 1.64). While stress scores are within a typical range (Z-score -0.71), the presence of higher self-esteem and happiness, coupled with low anxiety and depression, suggests a generally positive psychological disposition. Academic performance, as reflected by GPA, is consistently high across multiple semesters.

Behavioral patterns reveal a participant who engages in regular social exercise, participating in this activity three times a week or more (Z-score 1.23), contrasting with infrequent solitary exercise (1-2 times a month). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all,"" with corresponding low Z-scores, indicating minimal to no reported use. Daily recreation habits lean towards passive activities; the participant spends a substantial amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and moderate time playing video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.96). Notably, internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are all reported as minimal or not at all, with several of these having significantly negative Z-scores. This suggests a preference for screen-based entertainment over other forms of leisure.

Physiologically, the participant presents with a lower than average resting heart rate (48.2, Z-score -1.18) and a below average mesor (65.92, Z-score -1.1). The mesor represents the daily average heart rate, and its lower value could indicate a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm (10.9, Z-score 0.04) is close to the population average, suggesting a moderate daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is reported as 1:01 PM. Examining the hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of significant heart rate reduction during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -24.49 deviation between 3-4 AM, Z-score -1.29). Conversely, a marked increase in heart rate deviation is observed during the morning and midday hours (e.g., 14.97 between 6-7 AM, Z-score 4.41; 17.85 between 1-2 PM, Z-score 1.66), which is likely indicative of waking and daytime activity. The interdaily stability (0.39, Z-score -0.16) and intradaily variability (0.44, Z-score -0.74) are slightly below average, suggesting a moderate degree of regularity in the heart rate circadian rhythm.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -1.25). The variability in sleep duration is close to average. The median sleep start time is late, at 23:35:15, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times. The absence of daily naps is notable (Z-score -0.86). The correlations provided suggest that higher CES-D scores and STAI scores are weakly positively correlated with PSQI, while higher Self-Esteem, Trust, Happiness, and Health Satisfaction are weakly negatively correlated. Physical activity, particularly exercising with others, and daily recreation habits such as watching TV/videos/movies are weakly positively correlated with PSQI.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes is below the population mean and falls below the 25th percentile of the PSQI population, which has a mean of 6.73 and a 25th percentile of 5.0. A shorter sleep duration is generally associated with poorer sleep quality. While the participant exhibits positive psychological traits such as high self-esteem, happiness, and low anxiety and depression, which are typically associated with better sleep, these factors do not directly counteract the objective measure of insufficient sleep duration. The weak positive correlations between CES-D, STAI, and PSQI, and weak negative correlations between self-esteem, happiness, and PSQI, indicate that psychological well-being is somewhat related to sleep quality, but the primary indicator here is the objective sleep duration. The higher engagement in sedentary entertainment (watching TV/videos/movies) is weakly positively correlated with PSQI, suggesting a potential contribution to poorer sleep. Given the below-average sleep duration, despite positive psychological factors, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score would fall into the higher half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality relative to the study population.

45963,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile that warrants detailed examination in relation to sleep quality. Notably, high levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.05) and moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.9) are present, correlating positively with PSQI scores (STAI correlation: 0.4, CES-D correlation: 0.49). Conversely, self-esteem is below average (SelfEsteem Z-score: -1.15) and current happiness is notably low (Happy Z-score: -1.61), with both showing negative correlations with PSQI scores. Health satisfaction is also low (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.28). The individual engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week) but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are mixed, with infrequent solitary exercise (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.93) but regular engagement in exercising with others and sports (Exercised with Others Z-score: 0.53, Sports Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational habits include moderate internet usage and substantial music listening (Listening to Music: 2-3 hours), while activities such as watching TV, video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies are largely avoided.

From a physiological and behavioral monitoring perspective, the participant displays a highly irregular circadian rhythm. This is evidenced by a significantly low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.16, Z-score: -2.06), suggesting a lack of consistent daily patterning in physiological activity. The Intradaily Variability is also relatively low (Value: 0.39, Z-score: -1.09), which, in conjunction with low interdaily stability, may indicate periods of prolonged low activity or inconsistent sleep-wake cycles. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is noted at 4:11 PM. The Mesor (Mean Heart Rate) is elevated (Value: 81.81, Z-score: 1.07), and the Amplitude is notably low (Value: 4.2, Z-score: -2.13), indicating a reduced range of heart rate variation throughout the day relative to the population.

The participant's sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 40 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.64). However, the variability in sleep duration is within the typical range (Z-score: 0.32). A significant issue emerges with sleep timing, characterized by a median sleep start time of 01:56:43 AM. This late sleep onset is further exacerbated by a very high standard deviation in sleep start times (Value: 215 minutes, Z-score: 2.89), pointing to extreme irregularity in when sleep begins on different nights. The incidence of daily naps is minimal (Value: 0.08, Z-score: 0.04). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows substantial deviations from the Mesor, particularly during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am: -5.5, 4-5am: -11.79, 5-6am: -13.61). These pronounced negative deviations suggest periods of significant physiological quiescence during times that would typically be associated with deeper sleep or rest. Conversely, positive deviations are noted in the morning and early afternoon, indicating periods of higher arousal relative to the Mesor.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the participant's data suggests a likely high PSQI score, placing them in the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The participant reports high levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.05) and moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.9), both of which are positively correlated with PSQI scores (0.4 and 0.49, respectively). This psychological distress is a known contributor to poor sleep. Furthermore, the participant exhibits low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -1.15) and low current happiness (Happy Z-score: -1.61), which are negatively correlated with PSQI, but the strength of the positive correlations for anxiety and depression suggest these factors may have a more pronounced negative impact on sleep quality. Health satisfaction is also low.

The wearable data provides critical insights into disrupted sleep patterns. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 40 minutes is below average. More critically, the median sleep start time is very late (01:56:43 AM) and the standard deviation for sleep start time is exceptionally high (2.89 Z-score), indicating significant inconsistency in sleep scheduling, a hallmark of poor sleep quality. The low Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -2.06) in heart rate further supports the notion of a disorganized daily rhythm, which is often linked to impaired sleep. The presence of significant negative deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours further suggests potential sleep disturbances. While some behavioral factors like regular exercise with others and sports participation are positive, they do not appear to fully mitigate the impact of psychological distress and severe sleep timing irregularities. Given the convergence of these negative indicators, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls in the upper half of the distribution, signifying poorer sleep quality.

22138,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a moderately high level of trait anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of 0.86 on the STAI-Trait scale, suggesting a disposition towards experiencing anxiety. While not classified as depressed based on the CES-D score (Z-score of 0.18), the positive correlation (0.49) between CES-D and PSQI warrants attention, implying that even mild fluctuations in depressive symptoms might be associated with poorer sleep. Self-esteem appears to be in the average range, with a score of 42.0 and a Z-score of 0.54, but it exhibits a moderate negative correlation (-0.35) with PSQI, suggesting that lower self-esteem is linked to poorer sleep quality. The participant reports lower-than-average trust in others (Z-score of -0.78) and lower-than-average happiness (Z-score of -0.53), both of which show slight negative correlations with PSQI, suggesting that these factors may marginally contribute to sleep disturbances. Conversely, higher stress levels (Z-score of 0.65) exhibit a positive correlation (0.2) with PSQI, indicating a modest association between increased stress and poorer sleep quality. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Z-score of -0.62), with a weak negative correlation to PSQI.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in regular social drinking, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.94), which shows a negligible correlation with PSQI. Beer consumption is less frequent (1-2 times a month, Z-score of 0.3). Notably, the participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is primarily characterized by exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.23), while exercising alone is infrequent. However, exercise frequency has a very weak negative correlation with PSQI. Daily recreational habits indicate moderate engagement in screen time, with 1-2 hours of watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 1.28) and 2-3 hours of internet usage (Z-score of 0.85). Reading for 16-30 minutes daily shows a higher Z-score (1.3) but a minimal correlation with PSQI. Listening to music for short durations (15 minutes or less) and socializing with friends for 31 minutes to an hour are also reported, with weak correlations to PSQI.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals a resting heart rate of 60.6 bpm (Z-score of 0.29), which is within a healthy range. The mesor of 77.51 bpm (Z-score of 0.49) and amplitude of 13.05 bpm (Z-score of 0.73) suggest a noticeable circadian fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase at 4:20 PM indicates the peak heart rate occurs in the late afternoon. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a significant dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, with the lowest deviations from the mesor occurring between 3-4 AM (-21.12, Z-score -0.76) and 2-3 AM (-16.43, Z-score -0.53), which aligns with typical sleep patterns. Conversely, the highest deviations are observed in the afternoon, particularly between 1-2 PM (14.85, Z-score 1.1) and 6-7 PM (17.25, Z-score 0.82), reflecting periods of higher physiological arousal. The interdaily stability of 0.47 (Z-score 0.5) suggests a moderate level of regularity in daily circadian rhythms, while intradaily variability of 0.47 (Z-score -0.53) indicates relatively low variability within the 24-hour cycle, which is generally indicative of a well-structured circadian rhythm.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score of 0.43), which is slightly above average for this population. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 82 minutes (Z-score of -0.43), suggesting some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is 01:15:39, with a considerable standard deviation of 121 minutes (Z-score of 0.83), indicating significant inconsistency in sleep onset timing. There are no reported daily naps, which is common.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Analyzing the provided data in relation to the population's PSQI distribution (Mean: 6.73, SD: 2.16, 25th percentile: 5.0, 50th percentile: 6.0, 75th percentile: 8.0) indicates that this participant likely falls in the **bottom_50** percentile of the PSQI distribution, suggesting relatively good to average sleep quality.

Several factors support this conclusion. The participant's median sleep duration of 7 hours and 32 minutes is above the population median. While there is some variability in sleep duration and a notable inconsistency in sleep start times, these factors do not strongly point towards poor sleep quality in isolation. The circadian rhythm metrics, specifically interdaily stability and intradaily variability, suggest a reasonably structured daily rhythm, which is generally associated with better sleep. Furthermore, the participant's CES-D score is within the non-depressed range, and while trait anxiety is elevated, its correlation with PSQI is moderate, suggesting it might not be a primary driver of severe sleep impairment. Similarly, although self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction are on the lower end of average, their correlations with PSQI are relatively weak, indicating they are unlikely to be the sole determinants of poor sleep. The lack of substance use (beyond moderate alcohol consumption) and the presence of regular exercise with others are positive lifestyle indicators that can contribute to better sleep. The reported daily recreational habits, while including screen time, do not appear excessively high, and the positive correlations observed between these activities and PSQI are generally weak.

Conversely, there is no strong evidence to suggest a PSQI score in the top 50th percentile (indicating poor sleep quality). The absence of significant depressive symptoms and the presence of a longer sleep duration than the population median are points against high PSQI scores. While anxiety and lower self-esteem are present, their impact on sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI does not appear to be dominant in this dataset.

Therefore, based on the available multimodal data, the participant's overall sleep quality, as reflected by the PSQI, is likely to be in the lower half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a moderate level of psychological distress, with a CES-D score of 16.0 (Z-score 0.28), indicating some depressive symptoms, and an STAI score of 49.0 (Z-score 0.76), suggesting a tendency towards higher chronic anxiety. Despite these psychological factors, their self-esteem appears to be within the average range, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 39.0 (Z-score 0.11). Notably, the participant reports lower-than-average trust in others (Z-score -1.42) and lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53). Their academic performance, as indicated by their GPA, is generally good, with the most recent Fall 2016 GPA being 3.71. Behavioral habits reveal a moderate intake of alcohol (1-2 times a week for both beer and wine/liquor), with Z-scores indicating usage above the population average. They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is relatively low, particularly for sports, though they engage in individual and group exercise 1-2 times a week. Daily recreation habits are characterized by substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and a low engagement with reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score 1.3). Internet usage and time spent on sedentary hobbies are within the lower ranges compared to the study population.

From a physiological perspective, the participant's resting heart rate is notably elevated, with a value of 78.2 bpm and a Z-score of 2.38, significantly above the population average. The Mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate rhythm, is also high at 91.39 bpm (Z-score 2.38), further supporting an elevated overall physiological arousal state. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a higher-than-average Mesor, but a below-average amplitude (9.24 bpm, Z-score -0.5), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs relatively early in the afternoon at 4:05 PM. Intraday variability in heart rate is low (0.37, Z-score -1.24), indicating a more stable, less fluctuating heart rate throughout the day, which may be interpreted in conjunction with the elevated Mesor. Interdaily stability, reflecting the consistency of the rhythm across days, is within the average range (0.44, Z-score 0.25). The mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor shows a pattern of lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours, with significant negative deviations between 1 AM and 6 AM (e.g., -14.67 bpm at 4-5 AM). Heart rate begins to increase in the morning, peaking in the mid-morning to early afternoon, and then shows a gradual decline into the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 41 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.61). The standard deviation of sleep duration is 110 minutes, suggesting some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late, at approximately 00:39, with a standard deviation of 67 minutes, indicating some inconsistency in sleep onset. The participant reports very few daily naps (0.07, Z-score -0.08), suggesting minimal daytime sleep. The correlations between various metrics and PSQI scores offer some directional insights: CES-D, STAI, Stress, and Resting Heart Rate show positive correlations, implying that higher levels of these factors are associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, Self-Esteem, Trust, Health Satisfaction, and exercise frequency show negative correlations, suggesting that higher levels of these factors are associated with better sleep quality.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data provides several indicators that suggest their PSQI score may fall within the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 41 minutes, which is below the population average and associated with a negative Z-score (-0.61). Shorter sleep duration is a common indicator of poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant's resting heart rate is significantly elevated (Z-score 2.38), and the Mesor of their heart rate rhythm is also considerably high (Z-score 2.38). Elevated physiological arousal, as indicated by a high resting heart rate and Mesor, often correlates with poorer sleep quality and can contribute to difficulties in falling or staying asleep. The positive correlation between Resting Heart Rate and PSQI score (0.13) further supports this.

The participant also reports higher levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score 16.0, Z-score 0.28) and anxiety (STAI score 49.0, Z-score 0.76), both of which have positive correlations with PSQI scores (0.49 and 0.40 respectively), suggesting a tendency towards poorer sleep with increased psychological distress. While the self-esteem score is within the average range, the lower reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and trust (Z-score -1.42) may also contribute to sleep disturbances, as indicated by their negative correlations with PSQI. The significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and the relatively low engagement in reading (Z-score 1.3) could also be indicative of behaviors that disrupt sleep hygiene. Despite the low intradaily variability in heart rate, suggesting a relatively stable daily rhythm, the overall picture of elevated physiological arousal, increased psychological distress, and reduced sleep duration points towards a likelihood of poorer sleep quality.

Therefore, considering the confluence of elevated resting heart rate and Mesor, reduced sleep duration, and higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, it is reasonable to infer that this participant's PSQI score likely falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality.

46558,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a mixed profile regarding psychological and behavioral factors influencing sleep quality. Self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D) are at a level classified as ""Depressed,"" with a Z-score of 0.38, suggesting a burden slightly above the study population mean. This is positively correlated with PSQI score (0.5), indicating that higher depressive symptomology is associated with poorer sleep quality in this context. Conversely, the participant reports not being anxious (STAI Z-score: -0.43) and possesses a relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.45), which are generally conducive to better sleep. Happiness levels are notably high, with a Z-score of 1.64, suggesting a positive affect that might buffer against some sleep disturbances, though its correlation with PSQI is negative (-0.27), implying higher happiness might be associated with better sleep. Stress levels are near the population average (Z-score: 0.1), with a moderate positive correlation (0.2) to PSQI.

Behavioral habits reveal a pattern of moderate to high engagement in sedentary activities. While substance use is minimal (only beer usage 1-2 times a month), physical activity is notably low, with exercise frequency being less than 1-2 times a month and participation in sports being non-existent. This lack of exercise is reflected in low Z-scores for ""Exercised Alone"" (-1.18) and ""Exercised with Others"" (-1.58). Conversely, daily recreational habits include substantial amounts of time spent on video games (2-3 hours, Z-score: 3.23), internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85), and watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28). Socializing with friends is also reported at 2-3 hours daily, with a Z-score of 0.95. These patterns, particularly the high screen time and low physical activity, are often associated with disrupted sleep.

Physiological data from the wearable provides insights into the participant's circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The interdaily stability of heart rate is relatively low (Z-score: 0.83), suggesting some irregularity in daily rest-activity patterns. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.32). The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.09), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also slightly lower than average (Z-score: -0.16). The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, is reported as 5:17 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveal a significant drop in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM show deviations of -12.31 to -17.24), which is expected during sleep, but the magnitude of the deviation during these deep sleep hours suggests a potentially prolonged period of reduced physiological arousal. Notably, there are pronounced positive deviations in heart rate in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, 7-8 PM), potentially indicating periods of higher physiological activity or arousal during these times, with the highest positive deviation occurring between 7-8 PM (16.73). The resting heart rate (Value: 60.7, Z-score: 0.3) is slightly elevated compared to the population average.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is close to average with a slight negative Z-score (-0.12). However, the sleep duration standard deviation is relatively low (58 minutes, Z-score: -0.98), suggesting consistency in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is very late at 01:14:30, with a standard deviation of 55 minutes, indicating a tendency for late bedtimes that are somewhat consistent. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-score: -0.86) is a positive indicator for sleep. The positive correlations of sleep duration standard deviation (0.2) and sleep start time standard deviation (0.18) with PSQI suggest that greater variability in these aspects could lead to poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's overall PSQI score ranking, we will consider the evidence from various domains.

**Evidence for a low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile, representing relatively good or average sleep quality):**
The participant's median sleep duration is 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is close to the population mean. The sleep duration standard deviation is relatively low, indicating consistent sleep duration, which is a positive indicator for good sleep. The absence of daily naps is also beneficial for sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports not being anxious and has relatively high self-esteem, which are typically associated with better sleep. Happiness levels are also very high, potentially contributing to better overall well-being and sleep.

**Evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile, representing relatively poor sleep quality):**
The participant's self-reported depressive symptoms are at a level classified as ""Depressed,"" and this metric has a strong positive correlation (0.5) with PSQI score. This suggests that their depressive symptomology is likely contributing to poorer sleep quality. The median sleep start time is notably late (01:14:30), and while the variability is moderate, a consistent late bedtime can negatively impact sleep quality and circadian alignment. The participant engages in high levels of sedentary activities, particularly video games and internet usage, which are often associated with disrupted sleep. Low levels of physical activity and exercise are also generally linked to poorer sleep. The low interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score: 0.83) indicates some irregularity in daily rhythms, which can negatively affect sleep.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The positive indicators for sleep quality, such as consistent sleep duration and absence of naps, are somewhat counterbalanced by several significant risk factors. The ""Depressed"" classification for CES-D, with its strong positive correlation to PSQI, is a critical concern. The late sleep start time, combined with high levels of screen time and low physical activity, are also strong contributors to poor sleep hygiene. While self-esteem and happiness are positive, the presence of depressive symptoms and potential sleep disruption due to behavioral patterns suggest that the negative factors likely outweigh the positive ones in determining the overall PSQI score. Given that the CES-D score is above the population mean and has a strong correlation with PSQI, and considering the behavioral patterns indicative of poor sleep hygiene, it is probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the upper half of the distribution, signifying poorer sleep quality.

93699,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics. Psychologically, they report below-average levels of happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.11), alongside moderate levels of anxiety (Z-score: 0.27) and relatively low stress (Z-score: -2.34). Their self-esteem (Z-score: -0.45) and general trust in others (Z-score: -0.46) are also below the study average. These self-reported metrics suggest a participant who may experience some emotional challenges and lower overall well-being, though not indicative of clinically significant depression (CES-D Z-score: -0.55).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pattern of higher-than-average internet usage (Z-score: 2.19) and TV/video/movie watching (Z-score: 1.28), consuming more than 4 hours of internet daily and 1-2 hours of screen-based entertainment. Conversely, they engage in less frequent social activities with friends (Z-score: -0.62) and report not participating in sports (Z-score: -1.09) or reading (Z-score: -0.67). Their exercise frequency is moderate, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -0.43) and exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.53). Substance usage is generally low, with beer consumed 1-2 times a month (Z-score: 0.3) and wine or liquor less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -0.55).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a resting heart rate of 64.8 bpm (Z-score: 0.79), which is above the study average, suggesting a potentially higher baseline cardiovascular state. The mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, is also elevated (Z-score: 0.74). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively stable rhythm as suggested by an interdaily stability of 0.51 (Z-score: 0.83) and a low intradaily variability of 0.53 (Z-score: -0.11), implying consistent daily patterns in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs around 4:00 PM. However, the hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern: significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with deviations between -9.68 and -16.17), followed by a substantial increase into the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 11 AM - 2 PM, with deviations up to 16.31). This pattern suggests a pronounced dip in physiological arousal during sleep hours and a peak in activity during waking hours.

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score: -0.42), which is slightly below the study average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 108 minutes (Z-score: 0.16), indicating moderate variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:58:59), with a standard deviation of 89 minutes (Z-score: 0.14), suggesting some irregularity in bedtime. Notably, this participant reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a likely position in the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. While their median sleep duration is slightly below the average, it is not extremely short, and the correlation with PSQI score is negligible (0.05). Their sleep start time variability, though present, is also not strongly correlated with PSQI (0.18). Importantly, the absence of daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) is a positive indicator for sleep quality and shows a weak positive correlation with PSQI (0.18), suggesting that not napping might be associated with better sleep outcomes in this dataset.

Furthermore, the participant's psychological profile, while showing some lower scores in happiness and self-esteem, does not indicate high levels of depression or stress, which are often strongly associated with poor sleep quality. Their relatively low stress score (Z-score: -2.34) is particularly noteworthy. The wearable data, while showing a higher resting heart rate and mesor, indicates good stability and low variability in their circadian rhythm, suggesting a structured physiological cycle which is generally conducive to good sleep. The significant dips in heart rate during sleep hours further support the notion of deep sleep. The weak to negligible correlations observed between most of the individual behavioral and physiological metrics and the PSQI score do not provide strong evidence for a poor sleep quality classification. Given these factors, the aggregate evidence points towards a PSQI score that falls within the better half of the distribution.

84011,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a robust physiological rhythm, indicated by a relatively stable Mesor (63.1, Z-score -1.48) and a moderate amplitude (9.78, Z-score -0.32) in their heart rate variability. The acrophase occurring at 3:54 PM suggests a peak in physiological activity during the late afternoon. While the interdaily stability (0.35, Z-score -0.49) is below average, suggesting some variability in the day-to-day regularity of their circadian rhythm, the intradaily variability (0.69, Z-score 1.02) is notably high, indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. This high intradaily variability is further reflected in the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor, with pronounced peaks in the late evening (8-9 PM: 22.05, Z-score 2.19) and dips in the late night/early morning (9-10 PM: -4.29, Z-score -2.18). These patterns suggest potential challenges in maintaining a consistent physiological state across the 24-hour cycle.

Behaviorally, the participant reports a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI score 44.0, Z-score 0.27) and experiences relatively low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score 6.0, Z-score -0.76). Their self-esteem is above average (SelfEsteem score 33.0, Z-score -0.73), and they report moderate happiness (Happy score 4.0, Z-score 0.55). Stress levels are within the average range (Stress score 20.0, Z-score -0.44). Their trust of others is relatively low (Trust score 2.83, Z-score -0.78). The participant engages in moderate levels of exercise, specifically exercising with others (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23) and participating in sports (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.58), which are significantly higher than the average. Their sedentary behaviors are generally low, with limited time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or engaging in internet usage. Notably, they report not engaging in reading or listening to music. Socializing with friends is also reported as minimal (Time: 16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41). Substance usage is minimal across all categories.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 28 minutes, which is notably longer than the average (Z-score 1.59). The standard deviation of sleep duration is within the average range (84 minutes, Z-score -0.38), indicating consistent sleep duration night to night. The median sleep start time is approximately 00:03 AM, with a standard deviation of 82 minutes, suggesting some variability in sleep onset timing. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86). These sleep statistics, particularly the long duration, are generally indicative of adequate sleep quantity.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators relevant to their overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On the positive side, their reported median sleep duration is significantly longer than the population average (8 hours 28 minutes, Z-score 1.59), which typically correlates with better sleep quality. Furthermore, their sleep duration shows relatively consistent nightly lengths (standard deviation of 84 minutes, Z-score -0.38). The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) also often suggests a healthier sleep pattern.

However, several factors may indicate potential challenges. The participant's high intradaily variability in heart rate (0.69, Z-score 1.02) and pronounced deviations from their mesor, particularly elevated heart rate in the evening and dips at night, suggest physiological dysregulation that can impact sleep. While their chronic anxiety score is only slightly above average (STAI score 44.0, Z-score 0.27), and CES-D scores are low, these psychological factors can still subtly influence sleep quality. The participant's limited social interaction (Socializing with Friends: 16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41) and a lack of engagement in reading or listening to music, common relaxation activities, might also contribute to suboptimal sleep hygiene.

Considering the population PSQI distribution with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, the participant's longer sleep duration and consistency would typically suggest a score in the lower half (bottom_50). However, the significant physiological dysregulation indicated by heart rate variability and the potential impact of limited evening relaxation routines, along with moderate anxiety, could potentially elevate their PSQI score. Without a direct PSQI score, a definitive classification is challenging. However, the strong positive indicators of sleep duration and consistency tend to outweigh the more subtle influences of psychological and physiological variability in predicting overall sleep quality as measured by PSQI. Therefore, the available evidence leans towards a PSQI score in the bottom half of the distribution.

88008,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological patterns that are relevant to understanding their sleep quality. From a psychological perspective, the participant reports moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score 0.7), indicating a burden of symptoms experienced in the past week. Concurrently, they exhibit moderate chronic anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score 0.66). These elevated levels of both depression and anxiety are positively correlated with PSQI scores, suggesting a potential link to poorer sleep quality. Self-esteem is reported as relatively low (RSES score of 33.0, Z-score -0.73), with a moderate negative correlation to PSQI. General happiness is also below the population average (Z-score -0.53), and health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score -0.7), with both showing a negative correlation to PSQI. Stress levels are within the population average range (Z-score -0.44), but a positive correlation with PSQI is observed.

Behaviorally, this participant reports no substance usage, which aligns with lower PSQI scores. They demonstrate a high frequency of exercising alone and participating in sports (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58 respectively), and moderate frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 0.53). These higher frequencies of exercise are associated with lower PSQI scores. In terms of daily recreational habits, the participant spends a notable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64) and playing video games (Z-score 0.96), both of which show a slight positive correlation with PSQI. Internet usage and listening to music also occur with some regularity. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in less frequently. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, with a slight negative correlation to PSQI.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals a disrupted circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.52, Z-score 0.91), indicating poor consistency in daily physiological patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is also low (0.3, Z-score -1.73), suggesting a lack of robust daily fluctuations in heart rate. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated compared to the population average (78.44 bpm, Z-score 0.61). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly elevated (15.36, Z-score 1.48), indicating larger deviations from the mesor. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs at 5:06 PM. The resting heart rate is within the average range (55.1 bpm, Z-score -0.36). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -21.92, 3-4 AM: -25.5, 4-5 AM: -26.06), followed by a gradual increase leading into the afternoon and evening. This pattern, particularly the deep troughs in the early morning hours, along with a high amplitude and low interdaily stability, strongly suggests a disrupted sleep-wake cycle and potential issues with physiological regulation during sleep. The correlation of these metrics with PSQI scores, while generally weak, is mostly negative for stability and positive for variability and amplitude.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -1.29), and a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration (68 minutes, Z-score -0.75). The median sleep start time is very late at 01:13:59, with a standard deviation of 77 minutes, indicating variability in sleep onset. The correlation between median sleep duration and PSQI score is negligible, while sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability show a small positive correlation with PSQI. The low frequency of daily naps is also noted.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's overall sleep quality relative to the study population, we examine the convergence of evidence from the self-reported surveys and wearable data. The population PSQI scores range from a mean of 6.73 with a standard deviation of 2.16, placing the 50th percentile at 6.0 and the 75th percentile at 8.0.

Several indicators suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality, placing the participant towards the upper half of the PSQI distribution (top 50th percentile). The participant reports elevated levels of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, both of which have positive correlations with PSQI scores. Their self-esteem and general happiness are below average, and health satisfaction is notably low, with negative correlations to PSQI suggesting that lower scores in these areas might correspond to higher PSQI scores. While stress levels are moderate, they also show a positive correlation with PSQI.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate amounts of screen time (TV/videos, video games), which have a slight positive correlation with PSQI. Although the correlation is small, the combination of psychological distress and significant screen time could contribute to sleep disturbances. On the physiological front, the wearable data reveals significant disruptions in circadian rhythm regularity, characterized by low interdaily stability and a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours. This, coupled with an elevated amplitude, indicates a lack of robust daily physiological patterning, often associated with poor sleep. The median sleep duration of just over 6 hours is also notably short and below the population average, with a tendency towards later and more variable sleep start times, which generally correlate with poorer sleep quality.

Conversely, the absence of substance use and the high frequency of exercise are positive indicators that might buffer against extremely poor sleep quality, as these factors typically correlate with lower PSQI scores. However, the constellation of psychological distress, physiological circadian dysregulation, and suboptimal sleep duration and timing appears to outweigh these protective factors. Given the presence of multiple indicators associated with higher PSQI scores (depressive symptoms, anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, physiological circadian disruption, and short sleep duration), it is most probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the top 50th percentile, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

83566,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"This participant presents with a complex psychological and behavioral profile that may influence their sleep quality. They report high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 2.47) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.05), placing them significantly above the study population in these domains. Conversely, their self-esteem is relatively lower (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score: -1.29), and they report lower levels of happiness (Happiness Z-score: -1.61) compared to peers. While their reported trust of others is near the population average (Trust Z-score: 0.18), their overall satisfaction with physical health is slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.37). The participant reports no substance usage and limited engagement in exercise, with a particular absence of exercising with others and participating in sports. Their daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate internet usage (1-2 hours), but minimal engagement in activities like watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, or other sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a high mean heart rate, indicated by a Mesor Z-score of 1.49, and a higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.34). Their circadian rhythm, as derived from heart rate data, shows a moderate level of interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.09) and variability (Z-score: 0.24), suggesting some regularity but also some fluctuations in daily patterns. The acrophase, or peak of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 4:51 PM. Analysis of hourly deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns: significant deviations below the Mesor are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM to 5-6 AM), with the most pronounced negative deviations occurring between 5-6 AM (-18.19). Conversely, the participant experiences periods of elevated heart rate relative to the Mesor in the afternoon and evening (e.g., 2-3 PM, 6-7 PM, 8-9 PM). This pattern of lower heart rate during typical sleep hours and higher rates during the day might suggest disruptions to their natural sleep-wake cycle.

In terms of sleep statistics, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 8 minutes, which is slightly longer than the population average and has a positive Z-score (1.18). However, the variability in sleep duration is relatively low (Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.82). Their median sleep start time is late, at approximately 1:52 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86) is noted. The positive correlation between depressive symptoms and PSQI score (0.49) and anxiety and PSQI score (0.4) are notable. Furthermore, the negative correlation between self-esteem and PSQI score (-0.35), happiness and PSQI score (-0.27), and health satisfaction and PSQI score (-0.21) suggest that poorer psychological well-being is associated with worse sleep quality.

Considering the provided data, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety, along with their late sleep start times and potentially disrupted circadian rhythm patterns reflected in heart rate variability, points towards a likelihood of poorer sleep quality. While their reported sleep duration is relatively long, the other indicators suggest a compromised sleep experience. The positive correlations of key psychological distress measures with PSQI score strongly suggest a higher overall PSQI score.

87032,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that may influence sleep quality. Notably, elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score Z=+1.53) and stress (Score Z=+1.19) are present, with moderate positive correlations to PSQI scores (0.49 and 0.19, respectively). Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range (Z=-0.31) and shows a modest negative correlation to PSQI (-0.35), suggesting higher self-worth may be associated with better sleep. Health satisfaction is also within the average range (Z=-0.53) with a slight negative correlation to PSQI (-0.21).

In terms of daily habits, this participant reports significant engagement in sedentary activities. This includes substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z=+1.91), using the internet (Z=+2.19), and listening to music (Z=+2.06), all of which show slight positive correlations with PSQI scores (0.14, 0.11, and 0.11 respectively). Reading is also a frequent activity (Z=+2.28), but its correlation with PSQI is minimal (0.05). Notably, the participant reports no engagement in exercise or sports, a pattern with a small negative correlation to PSQI (-0.08 to -0.07), indicating that lack of physical activity might be minimally associated with poorer sleep. Substance usage is minimal to non-existent.

Wearable data reveals a moderately disrupted circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is low (Z=-1.15), suggesting inconsistency in daily activity patterns. While Intradaily Variability is elevated (Z=+1.44), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is notably low (Z=-1.87), suggesting a weak daily rhythmicity. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is elevated (Z=+1.56) with a positive correlation to PSQI (0.06), and the Resting Heart Rate is also higher than the population average (Z=+1.34), correlating positively with PSQI (0.12). The Acrophase, the peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (4:28 PM), which is within a typical range.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of pronounced physiological arousal during the night and early morning. The most significant negative deviations, indicative of lower heart rate and potentially rest, occur between 5-6 AM (Z=0.03) and 6-7 AM (Z=2.23), suggesting a later onset of deeper rest. Conversely, pronounced positive deviations from the mesor, suggesting increased physiological arousal, are observed in the late evening and early morning, particularly between 2-3 AM (Z=1.6) and 3-4 AM (Z=0.63), with similarly elevated deviations between 4-5 AM (Z=0.35) and 5-6 AM (Z=0.03). While the lowest heart rate is observed just before waking, the elevated heart rate in the early morning hours could reflect sleep fragmentation or a disrupted sleep architecture.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z=-0.58) and shows a slight positive correlation with PSQI (0.06). The standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly elevated (Z=0.3), suggesting some variability. The median sleep start time is very late, at 02:00:29 AM, with a high standard deviation (Z=1.36), pointing to significant sleep schedule irregularity. Daily naps are also more frequent than average (Z=1.27), with a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (0.16), suggesting that napping might be a compensatory behavior for poor nighttime sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a complex picture regarding sleep quality, with several indicators pointing towards potentially poorer sleep. The presence of elevated depressive symptoms and stress, combined with a shorter median sleep duration and significant sleep schedule irregularity, are all factors associated with diminished sleep quality. The wearable data further supports this, revealing a disrupted circadian rhythm with a weak daily periodicity and periods of heightened physiological arousal during the late night and early morning. The strong correlations between depressive symptoms (0.49) and stress (0.19) with PSQI, alongside a slightly shorter sleep duration (0.06) and increased napping (0.16), suggest a tendency towards poorer sleep.

Considering these multiple indicators, especially the psychological distress, irregular sleep timing, and fragmented sleep patterns suggested by the heart rate data, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score falls into the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

94641,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral indicators that may influence sleep quality. Notably, elevated scores on the CES-D scale (Z-score = 1.63) and the STAI (Z-score = 1.25) suggest a higher burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. These findings are positively correlated with PSQI scores, implying that increased psychological distress may be associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Z-score = -0.87) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.61), which are negatively correlated with PSQI scores, suggesting these factors may contribute to better sleep. Daily habits include significant time spent on video games (Z-score = 2.47) and listening to music (Z-score = 2.06), and extensive sedentary hobbies (Z-score = 3.19), while social interaction with friends is minimal (Z-score = -2.2). Notably, there is no reported substance usage or exercise.

Wearable data reveals a mesor (mean heart rate level) of 83.09 bpm (Z-score = 1.25), which is higher than the population average. The resting heart rate is also elevated at 70.3 bpm (Z-score = 1.44). The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a mesor deviation pattern with significant dips in heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am: -13.37, 4-5 am: -14.82) relative to the mesor, which might reflect periods of reduced physiological activity. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is noted at 4:49 PM. Interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.09) and intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.53) suggest a moderate regularity in the daily heart rate pattern. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score = -1.15), which is below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is notably high (Z-score = 1.52), suggesting considerable nightly variation in sleep length. The median sleep start time is around 12:30 AM, with a standard deviation of 89 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The frequency of daily naps is high, with a mean of 0.3 naps per day (Z-score = 2.66).

The participant's psychological profile is characterized by elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, alongside high self-esteem and health satisfaction. While the latter two are protective factors negatively correlated with PSQI, the former are positively correlated, suggesting a potential conflict in their influence on sleep. The participant's daily habits involve considerable time spent in sedentary activities, particularly video gaming and listening to music, with minimal social engagement. Wearable data points to a higher-than-average mesor and resting heart rate, and notable variability in sleep duration, with shorter average sleep. The increased frequency of naps also suggests potential issues with consolidated nighttime sleep. Given the positive correlations between depressive and anxiety symptoms with PSQI, and the objective data indicating shorter and more variable sleep durations, it is likely that the participant's overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, falls into the upper half of the study population distribution, indicative of poorer sleep.

The participant presents with a generally positive psychological profile, characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score of -0.24) and anxiety (STAI score of 39.0, Z-score of -0.23), and a moderate level of self-esteem (Self-Esteem score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.17). Their reported happiness is on the lower end of the spectrum (Z-score of -0.53), while trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.18). Stress levels are also slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.1). Academic performance is exceptionally high, with a consistent GPA of 4.0 across all recorded semesters. Health satisfaction is moderately positive (Z-score of -0.45).

Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs). Physical activity includes exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), with exercise involving others occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.53). Notably, the participant does not engage in sports. Daily passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music are limited to 15 minutes or less. Internet usage is also relatively low (16-30 minutes), while sedentary hobbies are engaged in for a similar duration. Socializing with friends occurs for 31 minutes to an hour daily. The participant reports not engaging in reading.

Physiologically, the participant's Fitbit data reveals a mesor of 76.53 bpm (Z-score of 0.35), with a resting heart rate of 60.2 bpm (Z-score of 0.24). The amplitude of their heart rate circadian rhythm is notably high at 15.56 (Z-score of 1.54), suggesting a significant daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:54 PM. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity show mixed results: interdaily stability is moderate at 0.5 (Z-score of 0.75), indicating some consistency in daily patterns, while intradaily variability is relatively low at 0.47 (Z-score of -0.53), suggesting less fluctuation within a 24-hour period beyond the primary circadian cycle. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is high at 0.45 (Z-score of 1.06), further supporting a consistent daily rhythm.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of lower heart rates during the late-night and early-morning hours, with the most pronounced negative deviations observed between 2-3 AM (-16.52, Z-score -0.55) and 3-4 AM (-18.0, Z-score -0.26), and 4-5 AM (-19.84, Z-score -0.29). Heart rates begin to increase in the late morning and peak in the afternoon, with significant positive deviations observed between 4-5 PM (17.78, Z-score 1.33) and 5-6 PM (27.42, Z-score 2.47), aligning with the acrophase. Heart rates then gradually decrease into the evening and night.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 59 minutes (Z-score of -0.25), which is slightly below the average but within a reasonable range. The standard deviation for sleep duration is 92 minutes (Z-score of -0.21), suggesting some variability but not excessive. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:05 AM, with a standard deviation of 93 minutes (Z-score of 0.21), indicating a degree of variability in sleep timing. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score of -0.86).

### Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data suggests that the participant likely falls into the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. While the median sleep duration is slightly under 7 hours, its Z-score of -0.25 indicates it is not significantly deviating from the population mean. The standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score -0.21) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.21) are also within acceptable ranges, suggesting a consistent, albeit not perfectly rigid, sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further supports good sleep habits, as naps can sometimes indicate underlying sleep disturbances.

Furthermore, the participant's generally low levels of depression (CES-D Z-score -0.24) and anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23), along with their high self-esteem (Z-score -0.17) and positive academic performance, are often associated with better sleep quality. While stress is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.1), it does not appear to be significantly impacting their overall sleep parameters. The positive correlation observed between higher self-reported happiness and lower PSQI scores (-0.27), and higher health satisfaction and lower PSQI scores (-0.21), aligns with the participant's relatively positive scores in these domains. The strong circadian rhythm indicated by high autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06) and a pronounced amplitude (Z-score 1.54), with a clear acrophase in the late afternoon, suggests a well-defined internal biological clock, which is conducive to good sleep. While the PSQI score itself is not provided, the confluence of these factors points towards a more favorable sleep profile compared to those who would score in the top 50% (indicating poor sleep).

45076,6.0,0.387434554973822,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits and behavioral habits, with some indicators suggesting potential impacts on sleep quality. Self-reported anxiety levels are elevated, as indicated by a Z-score of 0.27 on the STAI-Trait scale, which positively correlates with PSQI scores (0.40). Similarly, the participant reports higher-than-average stress levels (Z-score of 2.01), which also shows a positive correlation with PSQI scores (0.20). Conversely, self-esteem is reported as relatively low (Z-score of 1.38), with a negative correlation to PSQI (-0.35), suggesting that higher self-esteem may be associated with better sleep quality. While not classified as depressed, the CES-D score is slightly above average (Z-score 0.18) and shows a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (0.49). Happiness is reported below average (Z-score -0.53) with a negative correlation to PSQI (-0.27). Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Z-score -0.95), with a negative correlation to PSQI (-0.21), indicating that dissatisfaction with health may be linked to poorer sleep.

In terms of daily habits, the participant exhibits a significant engagement in strenuous physical activity, with exercise frequency categorized as ""Three times a week or more"" for exercising alone, with others, and in sports, all reflected by high positive Z-scores (1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively). These activities show small negative correlations with PSQI, implying a potential benefit to sleep quality. Substance usage patterns include weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94), with a negligible correlation to PSQI. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreation includes substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and moderate time spent socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.16). Internet usage is notably low (15 minutes or less, Z-score -1.83), which has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (0.12). Listening to music and reading are not regular habits.

Wearable data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a moderate interdaily stability of 0.32 (Z-score -0.74), suggesting some degree of daily consistency. However, the intradaily variability is relatively high at 0.59 (Z-score 0.32), indicating fluctuations in physiological activity throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately strong at 0.42 (Z-score 0.81), further supporting some rhythmic regularity. The mesor (mean of rhythm) is 70.34 bpm, slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.49), and the amplitude is 9.42 bpm, also slightly below average (Z-score -0.44). The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, is reported at 4:14 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is 57.8 bpm, which is close to the population mean (Z-score -0.04).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates distinct patterns. During typical sleep hours (approximately 1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate deviations are consistently negative and reach their lowest points, with values ranging from -11.62 to -15.74 bpm. This suggests a physiological calming during these periods. However, there is a noticeable surge in heart rate deviation in the late afternoon/early evening, peaking at 24.96 bpm between 4 PM and 5 PM (Z-score 2.4), followed by a significant elevation at 8 PM to 9 PM (15.25 bpm, Z-score 0.99). These elevated heart rates during waking hours, particularly in the afternoon and evening, could reflect periods of higher physiological arousal, potentially impacting the ability to wind down for sleep. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 38 minutes, which is slightly longer than the population average (Z-score 0.56), with a low standard deviation in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is close to midnight (00:57:00), and the variability in sleep start times is moderate. The low incidence of daily naps (0.07, Z-score -0.02) suggests consistent sleep attempts throughout the day.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data suggests a mixed profile concerning sleep quality. On one hand, the median sleep duration is within a healthy range, and napping behavior is minimal. The significant engagement in physical activity, particularly ""three times a week or more"" across multiple categories, generally correlates with better sleep. Additionally, lower than average self-esteem and health satisfaction, coupled with higher anxiety and stress levels, are associated with poorer sleep quality according to the provided correlations. The elevated heart rate deviations observed in the late afternoon and early evening may also disrupt sleep onset or maintenance.

Considering the population PSQI mean of 6.73 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, the participant's score would need to be greater than 6.0 to be in the top 50% (poorer sleep). The data presents several factors that lean towards a potentially poorer sleep quality, including elevated stress and anxiety, and significant deviations in heart rate during the evening hours which might indicate a less settled physiological state prior to sleep. While sleep duration itself is adequate, the presence of these psychological stressors and physiological arousal patterns could contribute to a higher PSQI score. The moderate positive correlations between stress, anxiety, and PSQI, and negative correlations between self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction, and PSQI, collectively suggest a tendency towards poorer sleep quality. Given these indicators, it is plausible that the participant's overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, would place them in the upper half of the distribution, indicating relatively poorer sleep.

44872,6.0,0.387434554973822,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile characterized by moderate psychological well-being and notable lifestyle habits, with implications for sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological state; for instance, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 5.0 suggests a low burden of depressive symptoms, further supported by a Z-score of -0.86, placing them below the population mean. Similarly, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is not elevated (Score: 39.0, Z-score: -0.23). Self-esteem is within the average range, with a score of 43.0. Happiness is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.64, indicating a significantly greater self-reported happiness compared to the study population. However, stress levels are moderately elevated (Score: 23.0, Z-score: 0.38). Health satisfaction is also high (Score: 6.0, Z-score: 1.3).

Lifestyle behaviors reveal a pattern of higher substance usage, with both beer and wine or liquor being consumed ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.72 and 1.68 respectively), indicating a significantly higher frequency of use compared to the population. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage are reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is robust, with the participant exercising alone and with others ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23, respectively). Sports participation is notably absent (""Not at all,"" Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less) and internet usage (16-30 minutes), with minimal engagement in video games and reading. Notably, socializing with friends is a significant daily activity, averaging ""2-3 hours"" (Z-score: 0.95).

Wearable data provides insights into physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. The mesor (mean heart rate) is relatively low (Value: 61.84, Z-score: -1.65), suggesting a lower average heart rate compared to the population. The amplitude of heart rate variation is also within the average range. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is recorded at 2:42 PM, indicating the typical time of highest cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is also on the lower side (Value: 48.3, Z-score: -1.17). Circadian rhythm stability metrics show lower than average interdaily stability (Value: 0.29, Z-score: -0.99) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.16, Z-score: -1.37), suggesting a less regular daily rhythm in heart rate. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Value: 0.61, Z-score: 0.46), indicating more fluctuation within a 24-hour period. The hourly deviation from mesor data highlights several periods of significantly elevated heart rate relative to the mesor, particularly between 10 AM and 1 PM (Z-scores up to 3.23) and again between 5 PM and 6 PM (Z-score of 3.2). Conversely, late night and early morning hours (12 AM to 6 AM) show consistent deviations below the mesor, reflecting typical sleep-related cardiovascular deceleration.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 58 minutes, which is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.27). The standard deviation of sleep duration is above average (Value: 135 minutes, Z-score: 0.77), suggesting variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late, at 11:38:55 PM, with a high standard deviation (Value: 154 minutes, Z-score: 1.55), indicating significant variability in bedtime. Daily naps are infrequent (Mean: 0.07, Z-score: -0.02).

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score, indicative of sleep quality, must be assessed in relation to the study population distribution. The provided data includes correlations between various metrics and the PSQI score, which, while supplementary, can offer guidance. Key indicators for potentially poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI scores) include higher stress levels (positive correlation: 0.2), higher sleep duration variability (positive correlation: 0.2), and later, more variable sleep start times (positive correlation: 0.18). Conversely, indicators for potentially better sleep quality (lower PSQI scores) include higher self-esteem (negative correlation: -0.35), higher happiness (negative correlation: -0.27), higher health satisfaction (negative correlation: -0.21), and greater trust in others (negative correlation: -0.21).

The participant's psychological profile, characterized by high happiness and health satisfaction, along with average self-esteem and not anxious or depressed, generally points towards better sleep quality. However, the elevated stress levels and significant variability in sleep start times and durations are concerning. The median sleep duration of just under 7 hours, while not extremely low, coupled with the late and inconsistent sleep schedule, suggests potential disruptions. The moderate positive correlations between stress, sleep duration variability, and sleep start time variability with PSQI scores, combined with the observed metrics in these areas, suggest a tendency towards poorer sleep. Despite positive psychological indicators, the behavioral and objective sleep pattern data, particularly the variability in sleep timing and duration, and moderate stress, lean towards sleep quality that may not be optimal. Considering the population's 50th percentile for PSQI is 6.0 and the 75th percentile is 8.0, the observed data, especially the sleep schedule variability and moderate stress, suggests the participant's sleep quality likely falls in the upper half of the distribution, indicating a higher PSQI score and thus poorer sleep quality.

The participant presents a complex profile with several noteworthy psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D: 6.0, Z-score: -0.76) and anxiety (STAI: 37.0, Z-score: -0.43), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" However, their self-esteem is notably high (SelfEsteem: 50.0, Z-Score: 1.66), which, despite the favorable psychological classifications, could indicate a potential incongruence if not supported by other metrics. Trust in others is above average (Trust: 3.83, Z-Score: 1.15), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53). A key finding is a significantly high level of health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction: 6.67, Z-score: 1.8), the highest among the measured psychological traits, suggesting a positive perception of their physical well-being. Stress levels are near the population average (Stress: 21.0, Z-Score: -0.17).

Behaviorally, substance usage is minimal, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported as less than 1-2 times a month, and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are robust, with the participant engaging in exercising alone and with others three times a week or more, which is significantly higher than the average (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07, Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23). Conversely, participation in sports is notably absent (Sports Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits are largely sedentary, with minimal engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, listening to music, or reading. Socializing with friends occurs for approximately 31 minutes to an hour, which is below average (Z-score: -0.62). The participant also reports no engagement in sedentary hobbies. The Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.11 indicates the participant is underweight, which, coupled with high health satisfaction, warrants further consideration.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate: 46.2, Z-Score: -1.42) and a mesor that is also significantly below the population mean (Mesor: 63.03, Z-Score: -1.49). This suggests a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability: 0.38, Z-Score: -0.24) and slightly higher intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability: 0.59, Z-Score: 0.32) than the population average, suggesting some degree of irregularity in daily rhythms, though not extreme. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also slightly below average (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours: 0.28, Z-Score: -0.36), further supporting a less consistent daily rhythm.

An analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights distinct diurnal patterns. Significant negative deviations, indicating heart rates substantially lower than the mesor, are observed during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score: -1.73, 4-5 AM Z-score: -1.68). Conversely, notable positive deviations, signifying elevated heart rates relative to the mesor, occur during the daytime, with peak elevations observed between 4-5 PM (Z-score: 7.80) and 7-8 AM (Z-score: 5.17), followed by another significant peak between 8-9 AM (Z-score: 3.06) and 3-4 PM (Z-score: 2.40). These patterns suggest a pronounced difference between periods of rest and activity, with the body's heart rate significantly dropping during sleep and increasing substantially during wakeful, active periods, particularly in the morning and late afternoon.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes, which is slightly below average for the study population (Z-Score: -0.6). The variability in sleep duration is also slightly below average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation: 84 minutes, Z-Score: -0.37). The median sleep start time is late, at 23:55:27, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation: 57 minutes, Z-Score: -0.57), indicating some consistency in bedtime but a tendency towards later sleep onset. Mean daily naps are negligible (Mean Daily Naps: 0.08, Z-Score: 0.04).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, warrants consideration of their position within the study population distribution. Several factors suggest a potentially better-than-average sleep quality. The participant exhibits low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem and health satisfaction. Their substance use is minimal, and their exercise habits are significantly above average. Although their daily recreational activities are predominantly sedentary, and their sleep duration is slightly below the median, the consistent exercise and positive psychological indicators may contribute to better sleep.

Conversely, some aspects could suggest a less optimal sleep. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes is on the lower side, and the participant's sleep start time is late. The somewhat elevated intradaily variability and lower autocorrelation in heart rate suggest a less structured circadian rhythm. Furthermore, the participant is underweight, which, while not directly measured by the PSQI, can sometimes be associated with underlying health issues that might impact sleep.

However, considering the strong positive indicators such as low psychological distress, high health satisfaction, and robust physical activity, alongside relatively moderate sleep duration and start time variability, it is likely that the participant's overall PSQI score falls within the lower half of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The positive self-perceptions and healthy lifestyle behaviors tend to correlate with better sleep outcomes.

This participant exhibits a relatively stable and consistent circadian rhythm, as indicated by moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.9) and low intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.31) in heart rate. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly above the population mean (Z-score: 0.43), suggesting a generally higher baseline physiological arousal. The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at approximately 6:09 PM, aligning with typical evening activity patterns.

Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a notable pattern of elevated heart rate in the late evening and early morning hours, specifically between 10-11 PM (Z-score: 1.32) and 11 PM-12 AM (Z-score: 1.79). Conversely, the period between 4-6 AM shows the lowest heart rate deviations (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-score: -0.06, 5-6 AM Z-score: -0.12), consistent with deep sleep phases. This pattern suggests a potential difficulty in initiating sleep or maintaining a lower arousal state during the initial hours of attempted rest.

In terms of self-reported psychological states, this participant reports a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI score: 45.0, Z-score: 0.37). Their self-esteem is at the upper limit of the scoring range (Score: 40.0), indicating high self-worth. Depressive symptoms are reported as minimal (CES-D score: 12.0, Z-score: -0.14), and self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score: -0.53). Notably, perceived stress levels are also below average (Z-score: -0.44), and health satisfaction is significantly lower than the population mean (Z-score: -1.45), suggesting a potential incongruence between subjective well-being and objective health perceptions.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (beer: three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.72) while reporting infrequent use of wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is relatively low, with sports participation occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91), while individual or group exercise occurs only 1-2 times a month. High levels of internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.19) and socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.53) are reported, contrasting with minimal time spent on sedentary hobbies like watching TV, playing video games, or reading.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.11). However, the median sleep start time is late, at 1:34 AM, with considerable variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 62 minutes, Z-score: -0.47), suggesting a somewhat irregular sleep schedule. The mean daily naps are slightly elevated (0.17, Z-score: 1.09).

The correlations provided suggest that higher anxiety levels are associated with slightly worse sleep quality (Correlation: 0.4). Lower health satisfaction also shows a negative correlation with sleep quality (Correlation: -0.22). While some behavioral factors show minor correlations, such as higher stress correlating with worse sleep (0.2), and lower self-esteem correlating with worse sleep (-0.35), these relationships are not consistently strong across all measures. The positive correlation between late-night heart rate deviation (e.g., 10-11pm, 11pm-12am) and PSQI score, although small, is noteworthy and aligns with the observed physiological patterns.

### Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the available data, this participant is likely to have a PSQI score in the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several indicators support this conclusion. The observed elevated heart rate during the late evening and early morning hours (10-11 PM and 11 PM-12 AM deviations from mesor) is directly associated with increased sleep disturbances and poorer sleep quality, as suggested by the positive correlation with the PSQI score. Furthermore, the median sleep start time of 1:34 AM, coupled with a significant standard deviation in sleep start times, points towards an irregular sleep schedule, a common contributor to poor sleep quality. Although median sleep duration is within a reasonable range, the late and variable sleep onset times likely disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle.

While the participant reports minimal depressive symptoms, they exhibit higher-than-average anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.37) and significantly lower health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.45). Both anxiety and lower perceived health can negatively impact sleep quality. The high internet usage and extended social media engagement could also contribute to sleep difficulties by delaying bedtime and potentially exposing the individual to stimulating content before sleep. Although self-esteem is high and stress is moderate, these factors do not appear to fully offset the negative influences on sleep. The positive correlation between anxiety and PSQI, and the negative correlation between health satisfaction and PSQI, further reinforce the likelihood of poorer sleep quality. Therefore, the convergence of physiological arousal patterns during sleep initiation, irregular sleep timing, and psychological factors like anxiety and low health satisfaction strongly suggests a PSQI score falling within the poorer half of the study distribution.

Self-esteem is within the normative range (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.03), and while trust in others is slightly above average (Trust Z-score: 0.83), self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Stress levels are notably low (Stress Z-score: -0.98). Health satisfaction is high, with a Z-score of 1.71 indicating a significantly positive outlook on physical health. Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports no substance usage (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all with Z-scores below -1.0). Exercise patterns are mixed; while participation in sports is infrequent (Sports Z-score: -0.42), the participant exercises alone 1-2 times a week (Exercised Alone Z-score: 0.32) and exercises with others three times a week or more (Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23), suggesting a robust social exercise component. Daily recreation includes substantial internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score: 1.52) for 3-4 hours, but minimal engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is limited to 16-30 minutes daily (Socializing with Friends Z-score: -1.41).

Physiologically, the participant displays several indicators of a regular circadian rhythm. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is notably low (Mesor Z-score: -2.2), which aligns with a low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -2.09). This suggests a potentially efficient cardiovascular system. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of heart rate, is reported as 5:03 PM, suggesting a typical late afternoon peak. Non-parametric circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.33) and intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.17), implying a reasonably consistent daily pattern. Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 0.48) further supports this consistency. The hourly deviation from mesor analysis reveals a distinct pattern: heart rate is significantly below mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM Z-score: -1.64, 2-3 AM Z-score: -1.32, 3-4 AM Z-score: -1.69, 4-5 AM Z-score: -1.48, 5-6 AM Z-score: -1.29, 6-7 AM Z-score: -1.34). Conversely, heart rate deviations are positive and elevated in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 9-10 PM (Z-score: 2.09) and 10-11 PM (Z-score: 2.37), indicating a period of higher physiological arousal prior to sleep.

Sleep statistics reveal a generally positive sleep pattern. The median sleep duration is 8 hours and 23 minutes, which is significantly longer than the study average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.49). Sleep duration variability is moderate. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:00 AM, with relatively low variability in sleep start times across nights (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.15). The participant also takes naps infrequently, with a mean of 0.25 naps per day, which is notably high compared to the population (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 2.07), suggesting a potential for fragmented sleep or a need for daytime rest. The correlations between these variables and the PSQI score are generally weak, with a few exceptions including a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.49) and STAI (0.40), suggesting that higher depressive symptoms and anxiety might be associated with poorer sleep quality. A positive correlation is also observed with sleep duration standard deviation (0.21), indicating that greater variability in sleep duration might be linked to poorer sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant presents with a profile that suggests potentially good to average sleep quality, likely placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. Several indicators support this conclusion. Firstly, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, both of which are known to negatively impact sleep quality and are positively correlated with higher PSQI scores in this dataset. Their self-esteem and health satisfaction are also within a healthy range, further contributing to a positive psychological foundation for sleep.

Physiologically, the observed circadian rhythm, while not perfectly stable, shows a clear pattern of lower heart rate during typical sleep hours and increased arousal in the late evening. This physiological structure, coupled with a notably long median sleep duration (above the 75th percentile of the study population), points towards an efficient sleep process. The relatively low variability in sleep start times also indicates a degree of regularity in sleep schedules.

While the participant engages in significant internet usage, a behavior that can sometimes disrupt sleep, this is offset by their low engagement in other sedentary recreational activities and their consistent exercise routine, particularly exercising with others. The higher than average daily naps are a potential concern and could indicate underlying sleep fragmentation or a need for rest, which might contribute to a slightly elevated PSQI score. However, the overall picture of low psychological distress, generally regular physiological patterns, and a long sleep duration strongly suggests that their sleep quality is likely better than the average participant. Considering the PSQI population statistics (Mean: 6.73, 50th percentile: 6.0, 75th percentile: 8.0), the evidence leans towards a PSQI score that falls below the median, indicating relatively good sleep quality.

28247,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile that likely influences their sleep quality. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 29.0, Z-score of 1.63, classified as 'Depressed') and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 61.0, Z-score of 1.95, classified as 'anxious'). These elevated levels of negative affect are positively correlated with PSQI scores, suggesting a potential impact on sleep. Conversely, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 31.0, Z-score of -1.01) and moderate happiness (Current happiness score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55), with lower self-esteem and happiness being associated with higher PSQI scores. Trust in others is lower than average (Trust score of 2.67, Z-score of -1.1), and while not strongly correlated with PSQI, it contributes to the overall psychological landscape. Stress levels are slightly above average (Stress score of 23.0, Z-score of 0.38).

In terms of behavioral habits, substance usage is low, with infrequent consumption of beer and wine/liquor, and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is notably limited; the participant exercises alone or with others less than once or twice a month and does not participate in sports, contributing to a low Z-score for exercising alone (-1.18) and exercised with others (-1.58). Daily recreational habits are characterized by extensive time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score of 2.06) and socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score of 2.53). Conversely, engagement with passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is minimal or non-existent, and internet usage is notably low (15 minutes or less, Z-score of -1.83). Reading and other sedentary hobbies are also limited to 15 minutes or less. The high engagement in music listening and social interaction, despite low physical activity, presents an interesting dichotomy in daily routines.

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal some disruptions. Interdaily stability (IS) is low (0.23, Z-score of -1.48), indicating a lack of consistent daily patterns in heart rate, which is negatively correlated with PSQI scores. Conversely, intradaily variability (IV) is high (0.76, Z-score of 1.51), suggesting a greater degree of fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which shows no correlation with PSQI. The mesor, representing the average heart rate around which fluctuations occur, is within the population average (75.03, Z-score of 0.15). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (5.8, Z-score of -1.61), potentially indicating a blunted daily physiological cycle. The acrophase, or peak time of the rhythm, is reported as 4:08 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly above average (62.2, Z-score of 0.48).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor provides further insight into daily physiological arousal patterns. During the late night and early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate deviations are notably negative, indicating periods of lower-than-average arousal during typical sleep times. Specifically, the period between 4 AM and 6 AM shows the most pronounced negative deviations (-14.41 and -14.1 respectively). As the day progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, particularly in the morning (e.g., 8-9 AM with a deviation of 7.43) and afternoon (e.g., 5-6 PM with a deviation of 9.94). This pattern suggests a potential mismatch between typical sleep-wake cycles and physiological activity, with reduced arousal during night hours and increased arousal during daytime hours. The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes, which is shorter than average (Z-score of -0.94), and a high variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 208 minutes, Z-score of 2.74), suggesting poor sleep consistency. There are no reported daily naps.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data presents several indicators that point towards poorer sleep quality, suggesting a PSQI score likely in the top 50th percentile of the study population. The presence of significant depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 1.63) and high chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.95) are strongly positively correlated with PSQI scores, indicating that psychological distress is a significant contributor to potentially poor sleep. Furthermore, the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes is below the population average, and the extremely high variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 2.74) suggests irregular sleep patterns, both of which are indicative of diminished sleep quality. The low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.48) in heart rate also points to a lack of consistent daily rhythms, which is negatively associated with PSQI scores. While the participant exhibits some positive traits like higher self-esteem and moderate happiness, and has low substance usage and physical activity levels that do not strongly correlate with PSQI, the cumulative evidence from psychological distress, sleep duration and variability, and circadian rhythm regularity strongly suggests a PSQI score that would place them in the upper half of the distribution, representing poorer sleep quality.

72806,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.86) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -0.82), suggesting a generally stable emotional state. Their self-esteem is within the average range for the population (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.11), and they report moderate levels of trust in others (Trust Z-Score: 0.83) and moderate happiness (Happy Z-Score: -0.53). Stress levels are slightly below average (Stress Z-Score: -0.17). Health satisfaction is also on the lower side of the average range (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.7).

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in infrequent alcohol consumption, with beer consumed less than 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month. They report no recreational or non-prescribed drug usage. Exercise habits are somewhat limited; they exercise alone 1-2 times a week but rarely exercise with others or participate in sports. Daily recreation is dominated by passive activities, with minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or using the internet. Socializing with friends is also reported as limited to 31 minutes to an hour daily. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for short durations (15 minutes or less).

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly above average (Interdaily Stability Z-Score: 0.5), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. Intradaily variability is near the population average (Intradaily Variability Z-Score: 0.03). The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle) is slightly below the population mean (Mesor Z-Score: -0.27), and the resting heart rate is also slightly lower than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-Score: -0.21), potentially indicating good cardiovascular fitness. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly higher than average (Amplitude Z-Score: 0.56), suggesting a more pronounced variation between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, representing the time of peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (4:00 PM).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of lower-than-average cardiovascular activity during the early morning hours (e.g., 1 AM to 6 AM, with deviations ranging from -22.45% to -11.21%). Notably, there is a significant spike in positive deviation between 6 PM and 7 PM (25.34%), suggesting a period of elevated physiological arousal in the early evening. Other periods of elevated heart rate include between 3 PM and 4 PM (15.05%) and between 9 PM and 10 PM (12.53%).

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes, which is slightly longer than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-Score: 0.47). The variability in sleep duration is below average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score: -0.36), suggesting consistency in how long the participant sleeps each night. The median sleep start time is late, around 12:30 AM, with moderate variability in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score: -0.32). The participant also has a slightly elevated rate of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-Score: 0.7), though the absolute value is low.

Correlations between various metrics and the PSQI score, though not overriding the holistic analysis, provide some directional guidance. A positive correlation between Stress and PSQI score (0.2) suggests that higher stress may be associated with poorer sleep quality. Similarly, a positive correlation between Mean Daily Naps and PSQI score (0.17) indicates that more frequent napping may be linked to worse sleep. Conversely, higher self-esteem (Score Correlation: -0.35) and trust (Score Correlation: -0.21) show a negative association with PSQI score, suggesting these factors may be associated with better sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score requires an assessment of whether it falls within the top 50% (indicating poorer sleep quality) or bottom 50% (indicating better or average sleep quality) of the study population. The population PSQI mean is 6.73 with a standard deviation of 2.16, and the 50th percentile (median) is 6.0. A PSQI score above 6.0 generally suggests poorer sleep quality.

Evidence suggesting a potentially **higher** PSQI score (top 50%) includes the elevated heart rate deviation between 6 PM and 7 PM (25.34%), which could indicate physiological arousal interfering with sleep onset or maintenance. While sleep duration is adequate, the median sleep start time is late (around 12:30 AM), and there is a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times, which can contribute to sleep disruptions. The slightly higher than average amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Amplitude Z-Score: 0.56) might also reflect more significant daily physiological fluctuations that could impact sleep. The positive correlation between stress and PSQI score (0.2), coupled with the participant's moderate stress levels, warrants consideration. Furthermore, the slightly lower health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.7) could be indicative of underlying issues that impact sleep quality. The positive correlation between daily naps and PSQI score (0.17) is also a factor, though the absolute number of naps is not excessively high.

Evidence suggesting a potentially **lower** PSQI score (bottom 50%) includes the participant's relatively low levels of depression (CESD Z-score: -0.86) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.82). Their self-esteem is within the average range (SelfEsteem Z-Score: 0.11), and they report moderate happiness (Happy Z-Score: -0.53). The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes is within the recommended range, and the sleep duration is consistent. The resting heart rate is slightly below average (Resting Heart Rate Z-Score: -0.21), which is a positive physiological indicator. The negative correlation between self-esteem and PSQI score (-0.35) suggests that their average self-esteem might contribute to better sleep quality.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the participant exhibits several positive indicators, such as low depression and anxiety and adequate sleep duration, several factors lean towards a potentially poorer sleep quality profile, placing them in the **top 50%** of the PSQI distribution. The late sleep start time, moderate variability in sleep schedules, and the significant early evening arousal indicated by heart rate data are notable concerns. The positive correlations between stress and naps with PSQI, alongside the moderate stress levels and some napping behavior, further support this conclusion. Although their psychological profile is generally positive, these behavioral and physiological patterns suggest a likelihood of experiencing challenges with sleep quality.

39146,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and moderate chronic anxiety (STAI score of 42.0, Z-score 0.07). Self-esteem appears to be within the average range, as indicated by a Self-Esteem score of 43.0, which is notably higher than the scale's upper limit of 40, suggesting potentially high self-esteem, though the Z-score is positive (0.68), suggesting it is above the mean of the population. Happiness is reported as relatively low (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Stress levels are notably elevated (Score 25.0, Z-score 0.92), suggesting a higher perceived burden compared to the study population. Health satisfaction is above average (Score 4.78, Z-score 0.38).

Behaviorally, this participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and minimal engagement in physical activity, with exercise frequency being ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" for solo exercise and ""Not at all"" for exercising with others or sports. Daily recreation habits reveal a significant amount of time spent on video games (1-2 hours, Z-score 2.47), internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), alongside moderate time spent on sedentary hobbies and socializing with friends. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies and reading is minimal.

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a mesor heart rate of 78.4 bpm (Z-score 0.61) and an amplitude of 10.99 bpm (Z-score 0.07), indicating a higher-than-average resting heart rate and an average range of daily variation. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is observed at approximately 3:57 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours, with deviations from the mesor being most negative between 1 AM and 6 AM. Heart rates begin to increase in the morning, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening. Resting heart rate is also elevated at 65.4 bpm (Z-score 0.86), which is significantly higher than the mesor, indicating a substantial difference between resting and peak heart rates. Circadian rhythm metrics, including interdaily stability (0.46, Z-score 0.42) and intradaily variability (0.62, Z-score 0.53), are within a range that suggests moderate regularity in daily rhythms. Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.46, Z-score 1.15) indicates a moderate degree of rhythmicity over a 24-hour period.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score -0.47), which is slightly below the population average. The variability in sleep duration is relatively low (Standard Deviation 62 minutes, Z-score -0.89). The median sleep start time is late at 1:32 AM, with a moderate standard deviation of 84 minutes (Z-score 0.01), suggesting some variability in sleep onset. There are no recorded daily naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86).

The participant's PSQI score would likely place them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. This conclusion is drawn from several contributing factors. Firstly, while the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes is slightly less than ideal, the low standard deviation in sleep duration suggests consistent sleep patterns. The absence of naps further contributes to consolidated sleep. Furthermore, the participant reports no substance use, which is often associated with poorer sleep quality. While stress levels are high, the self-reported CES-D score indicates a lack of significant depressive symptoms, which often correlates with poor sleep. The negative correlation between Self-Esteem and PSQI score (-0.35) suggests that higher self-esteem may be associated with better sleep quality. Similarly, negative correlations with Health Satisfaction (-0.21) and Happiness (-0.27) indicate that better health satisfaction and higher happiness may be linked to better sleep quality, suggesting that their current levels may not be significantly detrimental. The wearable data, while indicating some physiological arousal patterns and a late sleep onset, does not present extreme deviations that would strongly suggest poor sleep quality on its own. The positive correlation between lower deviations from mesor during sleep hours (e.g., 2-3 am, 3-4 am) and PSQI score suggests that lower deviations during these times are associated with poorer sleep quality. However, the overall picture, considering the lack of significant reported sleep disturbances in the self-report data and the absence of substance use, leans towards average to good sleep quality within the context of the study population.

67918,3.0,0.015706806282722512,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a generally healthy psychological profile, characterized by low levels of reported depression (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score of -0.86) and anxiety (STAI score of 35.0, Z-score of -0.62). Their self-esteem is notably high, as indicated by a Z-score of 1.38 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. This high self-esteem is correlated with a moderate negative association with PSQI scores (-0.35), suggesting that higher self-esteem may be linked to better sleep quality. Similarly, higher reported health satisfaction (score of 5.89, Z-score of 1.22) also shows a slight negative correlation with PSQI scores (-0.21). Trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.18), and current happiness levels are slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53), both exhibiting weak negative correlations with PSQI scores. Stress levels are near the population mean (Z-score of -0.17), with a very weak positive correlation to PSQI scores (0.20).

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), with Z-scores indicating significantly lower usage than the study population. Exercise habits are moderate, with ""Exercised Alone"" and ""Exercised with Others"" reported as ""1-2 times a month"" (Z-scores of -0.43 and -0.17, respectively), and ""Sports"" frequency as ""Not at all"" (Z-score of -1.09). These exercise patterns show negligible correlations with PSQI scores. Daily recreational habits show a pattern of moderate engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 0.01) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.18), with moderate engagement in listening to music (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.21) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.16). Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for shorter durations. None of these daily recreation habits show strong correlations with PSQI scores, with most being very weak and either positive or negative.

The wearable data reveals a highly regular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.59, Z-score of 1.49) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.52, Z-score of 1.65) are significantly elevated compared to the study population, indicating strong day-to-day consistency in activity patterns. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (0.37, Z-score of -1.24) is notably low, suggesting a lack of fragmentation in daily activity. The Mesor (81.27, Z-score of 1.0) and Amplitude (15.71, Z-score of 1.59) of the heart rate rhythm are also higher than average, indicating a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate, with the peak activity (Acrophase) occurring in the mid-afternoon (3:42 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly above average (62.8, Z-score of 0.55), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI scores (0.13).

Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates periods of significantly lower than expected heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: -18.41, Z-score of -1.51; 2-3 AM: -20.43, Z-score of -1.1; 3-4 AM: -22.68, Z-score of -1.01). Conversely, the participant exhibits periods of elevated heart rate during the afternoon, particularly between 1 PM and 3 PM (e.g., 1-2 PM: 19.37, Z-score of 1.95; 2-3 PM: 19.68, Z-score of 2.34), aligning with the Acrophase and reflecting a pattern of physiological arousal during the day. These hourly deviations show mostly weak correlations with PSQI scores.

Sleep statistics indicate a notably long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 42 minutes, which is significantly above the study population mean (Z-score of 1.88). This long sleep duration has a weak positive correlation with PSQI scores (0.07). The variability in sleep duration and sleep start time is relatively low (Z-scores of -0.6 for both standard deviations), suggesting consistent sleep timing. The median sleep start time is late, at 23:38:52. There are no reported daily naps.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely has a PSQI score in the **bottom 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively good to average sleep quality.

Evidence supporting a lower PSQI score includes the participant's generally healthy psychological profile, characterized by low depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem. High self-esteem and health satisfaction are negatively correlated with PSQI scores, suggesting they are associated with better sleep. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a highly regular and structured circadian rhythm, with strong interdaily stability and low intradaily variability. This regularity in physiological patterns is often indicative of good sleep hygiene and quality. While the median sleep duration is quite long, which weakly correlates with higher PSQI scores, the consistency in sleep duration and start time, along with the absence of naps, points towards a stable sleep pattern. The low variability in sleep start time, despite being late, suggests a consistent, albeit potentially delayed, sleep schedule.

Evidence for a higher PSQI score (poorer sleep quality) is less pronounced. The positive correlation between resting heart rate and PSQI, while weak, could be a minor indicator. Additionally, the very long sleep duration, while indicative of sleep being obtained, could on its own (if interpreted as oversleeping or fragmented sleep causing longer time in bed) contribute to a higher PSQI score in some domains. However, the overall consistency and regularity of sleep metrics suggest that these factors do not outweigh the indicators of good sleep. The moderate engagement in passive recreational activities and shorter durations for reading and sedentary hobbies do not strongly suggest poor sleep hygiene in this context, especially given the lack of substance use.

Holistically, the strong indicators of a regular circadian rhythm, consistent sleep timing, positive psychological well-being, and healthy lifestyle choices (e.g., no substance use) strongly suggest that this participant experiences relatively good sleep quality, placing them in the bottom 50% of the PSQI distribution.

34467,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a generally positive psychological profile. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score -0.66) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score -0.82). Self-esteem is within the normative range (score of 40.0, Z-score 0.26), and the participant reports high levels of happiness (Z-score 1.64). While stress levels are slightly elevated (Z-score 0.1), this does not appear to be a dominant concern. Trust in others is moderate (Z-score 0.18), and health satisfaction is good (score of 5.33, Z-score 0.8). Academic performance is strong, with GPAs consistently at or near 4.0 across multiple semesters.

Behaviorally, this participant abstains from substance use, including alcohol, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits indicate regular physical activity, with a notable tendency to exercise with others (frequency ""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.23) alongside exercising alone (frequency ""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score 0.32). Participation in sports is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-score -1.09). Daily recreational habits reveal a preference for activities like socializing with friends (time ""31 minutes an hour,"" Z-score -0.62) and moderate internet usage (time ""31 minutes an hour,"" Z-score -0.49). There is a distinct absence of watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, listening to music, or dedicated reading time, and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for a short duration (16-30 minutes).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals several interesting patterns. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the day, is notably low (Z-score -2.13), suggesting a lower overall resting cardiovascular load compared to the study population. This is further supported by a low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.49). The circadian rhythm exhibits moderate regularity, with an interdaily stability of 0.3 (Z-score -0.9) and a high intradaily variability of 0.75 (Z-score 1.44). The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is recorded at 2:42 PM. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates a distinct diurnal pattern. Heart rate is significantly depressed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am: -16.92, Z-score -2.15; 3-4 am: -23.28, Z-score -1.1) and elevated during the morning and evening hours (e.g., 7-8 am: 17.41, Z-score 3.24; 7-8 pm: 22.23, Z-score 1.87). This pattern suggests a clear wakefulness-activity period and a pronounced sleep-related suppression of heart rate.

Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes (Z-score 0.28). However, the variability in sleep duration is slightly elevated (standard deviation of 128 minutes, Z-score 0.61), suggesting some inconsistency in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late, at 23:34:13, with a substantial standard deviation of 134 minutes (Z-score 1.12), indicating considerable variability in bedtime. The participant also engages in occasional naps (mean daily naps 0.12, Z-score 0.61). The correlations observed between several metrics and PSQI score provide additional context. Notably, higher levels of happiness and health satisfaction are weakly correlated with lower PSQI scores (negative correlations), suggesting these positive psychological states may be associated with better sleep quality. Conversely, higher stress levels show a weak positive correlation with PSQI, aligning with the expectation that stress can negatively impact sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we will holistically analyze the evidence presented. The population PSQI mean is 6.72 with a standard deviation of 2.16, placing the 50th percentile at 6.0 and the 75th percentile at 8.0. This suggests that scores below 6.0 are in the bottom 50% (good sleep quality), and scores above 8.0 are in the top 50% (poor sleep quality).

Evidence for a **low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile)**, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality, is supported by several factors. The participant reports good health satisfaction and high levels of happiness, both of which show a negative correlation with PSQI score. Their academic performance is excellent, and they exhibit no substance use, contributing to a generally healthy lifestyle. Crucially, their median sleep duration is 7 hours and 24 minutes, which is within recommended ranges and has a positive Z-score, indicating it is longer than average for this cohort. The wearable data also shows a pronounced reduction in heart rate during sleep hours, indicative of restorative sleep. While there is some variability in sleep duration and start time, the core sleep duration is substantial.

Evidence for a **high PSQI score (top 50th percentile)**, indicating relatively poor sleep quality, is less pronounced but warrants consideration. The participant's sleep start time has a high standard deviation, suggesting irregularity, and they do engage in occasional naps. Elevated stress, while not severe, is positively correlated with PSQI score. The intradaily variability of heart rate is high, which could, in some contexts, be associated with poorer sleep regulation, though in this case, it is paired with a low mesor and resting heart rate, potentially reflecting a high level of physical activity during awake periods.

**Holistic Analysis:**

Considering the entirety of the data, the evidence strongly suggests the participant would fall into the **bottom 50th percentile** of the PSQI distribution. The robust indicators of good sleep quality, namely sufficient sleep duration, positive psychological well-being (high happiness, good health satisfaction), and the absence of detrimental lifestyle factors (substance use), outweigh the concerns related to sleep schedule variability and occasional naps. The negative correlations between happiness, health satisfaction, and PSQI are particularly salient, pointing towards an association with better sleep. The physiological data, despite some variability, ultimately supports a pattern of consolidated rest during sleep periods.

59673,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.43), with a high self-esteem score (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.66), which is notably above the study population mean. They also report a high level of trust in others (Trust Z-score: 1.15) and a moderately positive self-assessment of happiness (Happy Z-score: 0.55). While their reported stress levels are close to the population average (Stress Z-score: 0.1), their overall satisfaction with physical health is comparatively low (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Usage Z-score: 0.94) and beer (Usage Z-score: 0.3), while reporting no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity includes exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, with no participation in sports (Sports Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits are varied, with limited time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -0.62), playing video games (Z-score: -0.56), and moderate internet and music listening durations (Z-scores: -0.49 and 0.21 respectively). Notably, they spend a considerable amount of time socializing with friends (Z-score: -0.62), and do not engage in reading or other sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a regular circadian rhythm, as suggested by the interdaily stability (Value: 0.42, Z-score: 0.09) and intradaily variability (Value: 0.57, Z-score: 0.17) metrics. The mesor (Value: 74.66, Z-score: 0.1) and amplitude (Value: 10.79, Z-score: 0.0) are within typical ranges. The acrophase, occurring at 5:58 PM, aligns with a common pattern of peak cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon/early evening. The resting heart rate (Value: 57.2, Z-score: -0.11) is slightly below the population average. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of elevated physiological arousal in the late evening and early morning hours, particularly between 11 PM and 1 AM (12-1am Z-score: 1.72, 11-12am Z-score: 1.49) and again between 5 PM and 8 PM (5-6pm Z-score: 0.81, 6-7pm Z-score: 1.44). Conversely, significant dips in heart rate from the mesor are observed during the late night and early morning sleep period (e.g., 3-4am Z-score: -0.39, 4-5am Z-score: -0.24).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score: 0.54), which is longer than the population average. However, the sleep duration standard deviation is relatively high (Value: 144 minutes, Z-score: 0.98), suggesting considerable variability in nightly sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late at 1:21 AM (Z-score: 0.33), and there is also notable variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 98 minutes, Z-score: 0.33). The participant also engages in a higher than average number of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.18, Z-score: 1.27).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The PSQI population data indicates a mean score of 6.72 with a standard deviation of 2.16. The 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. Therefore, a score of 6 or below is considered within the bottom 50% (good to average sleep quality), and a score above 6 is in the top 50% (poor sleep quality).

Evidence for a potentially low PSQI score (bottom 50%) includes the participant's generally positive psychological state, characterized by low reported depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem. Their overall sleep duration is above average, and while there is variability, it is not exceptionally so. The moderate correlation coefficients between some of their more positive traits (e.g., STAI, CESD, Health Satisfaction) and PSQI score suggest that improvements in these areas might be associated with better sleep quality.

Conversely, evidence for a potentially high PSQI score (top 50%) is suggested by the considerable variability in sleep duration and sleep start times. The late median sleep start time and higher than average frequency of naps also point towards potential disruptions in sleep patterns. The significant deviations in heart rate from the mesor during late evening and early morning could indicate physiological arousal interfering with sleep consolidation. The low health satisfaction, despite other positive psychological indicators, might indirectly influence sleep quality.

Considering the available evidence holistically, the significant variability in sleep duration and start times, coupled with the physiological indicators of arousal during typical sleep periods and the late sleep onset, lean towards a PSQI score that is likely in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. While positive psychological traits are present, the sleep-specific metrics and physiological data suggest more notable challenges.

74899,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant presents with a notable constellation of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may inform their sleep quality. A significant finding is the elevated score on the STAI-Trait anxiety scale (Z-score = 1.06), classifying them as anxious. This is accompanied by a moderately elevated CES-D score (Z-score = 0.38), suggesting some burden of depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within average to slightly below average range (Z-score = -0.87), and self-reported happiness is also on the lower side (Z-score = -0.53). A particularly striking metric is the high stress level (Z-score = 2.28), indicating this individual experiences considerably more stress than the study population. Health satisfaction is also reported as above average (Z-score = 1.3).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 1.01) and moderate exercise, including alone (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07) and with others (Frequency: 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.53), and sports (Frequency: 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.91). Their daily recreational habits include moderate screen time, with 16-30 minutes of watching TV/videos/movies and 1-2 hours of internet usage. Notably, they spend limited time listening to music (15 minutes or less) and do not engage in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability of 0.43 (Z-score = 0.17) and an Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of 0.3 (Z-score = -0.19). The participant's resting heart rate is 62.1 bpm (Z-score = 0.47), which is within a healthy range. The mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is 80.87 bpm (Z-score = 0.95). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2-3 AM and 4-5 AM, with significant negative deviations reaching -10.98 and -17.27 respectively. This is followed by a marked increase in heart rate in the late afternoon and evening, with positive deviations peaking between 5-6 PM (22.1, Z-score = 1.69) and 8-9 PM (15.02, Z-score = 0.95), aligning with the acrophase reported at 5:49 PM.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

To assess the participant's overall sleep quality relative to the study population, we examine the available data and its correlation with PSQI scores. The participant's median sleep duration is 5 hours and 58 minutes (Z-score = -1.52), which is considerably shorter than the population average and indicates a likely negative impact on sleep quality. The median sleep start time is 02:25:30, which is also very late and may contribute to poor sleep.

Several self-reported measures also suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality. The high anxiety (STAI, Z-score = 1.06) and elevated stress levels (Z-score = 2.28) are known contributors to sleep disturbances. While not directly correlated with PSQI in the provided data, these psychological states are strongly associated with diminished sleep quality in the literature. The CES-D score (Z-score = 0.38) and lower happiness (Z-score = -0.53) could also indirectly influence sleep.

The wearable data, while indicating some regularity in circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability = 0.43), also highlights extremely short sleep durations. The positive correlations between higher anxiety, stress, and potentially depressive symptoms with PSQI scores (0.40, 0.19, and 0.49 respectively) suggest that these factors likely contribute to a higher PSQI score for this participant. Given the significantly low median sleep duration, late sleep onset, and the presence of elevated anxiety and stress, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

35011,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological patterns, which are analyzed in conjunction with their sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Self-report data indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score of 0.7), suggesting a subjective experience of a higher burden of these symptoms compared to the study population. Conversely, they report low levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 36.0, Z-score of -0.52) and a moderate level of trust (Trust score of 3.17, Z-score of -0.14). Their self-esteem is in the upper quartile of the study population (SelfEsteem score of 45.0, Z-Score of 0.96). However, their overall health satisfaction is notably low (Health Satisfaction score of 1.89, Z-score of -1.78), indicating a significantly lower satisfaction with their physical health compared to their peers. Despite reporting moderate happiness (Current happiness score of 4.0, Z-Score of 0.55), the elevated depressive symptoms and low health satisfaction warrant attention. Stress levels are relatively low (Stress score of 18.0, Z-Score of -0.98). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows a slight decline over the observed period, with scores ranging from 3.53 to 3.1.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times per week, which places them in the higher quartile for these activities (Beer Z-Score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-Score: 0.94). They do not report using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is relatively low, with exercise and sports participation occurring only 1-2 times a month (Exercised Alone Z-Score: -0.43, Exercised with Others Z-Score: -0.17, Sports Z-Score: 0.25). Their daily recreation habits involve significant screen time, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: 0.64) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.18), and listening to music (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: 0.21). Notably, they report minimal time spent socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: -0.62), and do not engage in reading or sedentary hobbies. This pattern suggests a lifestyle characterized by higher screen-based leisure and lower social interaction and engagement in more passive or physically demanding activities.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a significantly elevated resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Value: 77.6, Z-Score: 2.31), which is considerably higher than the study population's average. The mesor (average daily heart rate), derived from cosinor analysis, is also high (Mesor Value: 86.67, Z-Score: 1.74), suggesting an overall elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm is notably low (Amplitude Value: 4.29, Z-Score: -2.1), indicating a reduced diurnal variation in heart rate, which could be indicative of a less robust circadian rhythm. This is further supported by low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Value: 0.17, Z-Score: -1.98) and high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Value: 0.74, Z-Score: 1.37) in heart rate, suggesting a lack of consistent daily rhythmicity and greater fluctuation within days. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm is reported at 5:46 PM, indicating the peak time of heart rate during the day. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. A significant decrease in heart rate deviation is observed during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 3-4 AM (Value: -8.22, Z-Score: 1.28) and 4-5 AM (Value: -7.12, Z-Score: 1.82), suggesting a period of significantly reduced physiological arousal during these hours, aligning with typical sleep periods. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during late afternoon and evening, with peaks between 7-8 PM (Value: 9.86, Z-Score: -0.29) and 10-11 AM (Value: 9.4, Z-Score: 0.63), suggesting periods of increased physiological activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 5 minutes, which is shorter than the study average (Median Sleep Duration Z-Score: -1.37). The standard deviation of sleep duration is 63 minutes, which is moderately variable (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score: -0.87). The median sleep start time is late, at 02:34:00 AM, with a standard deviation of 70 minutes, suggesting some irregularity in sleep onset (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score: -0.28). The participant does not report daily naps. The correlation analysis between various metrics and PSQI score indicates that higher depressive symptoms (CES-D correlation: 0.49), higher stress levels (Stress correlation: 0.2), and a higher resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate correlation: 0.12) are positively associated with PSQI score, suggesting these factors may contribute to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem (SelfEsteem correlation: -0.35) and higher health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction correlation: -0.21) are negatively associated with PSQI score, indicating these factors may be protective of sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's PSQI score ranking, we examine the available evidence in relation to the study population's PSQI distribution. The population mean PSQI is 6.72, with a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score above 6.0 generally indicates poorer sleep quality.

Evidence supporting a potentially high PSQI score (top 50th percentile, indicating poorer sleep quality) includes:
*   **Elevated Depressive Symptoms:** A CES-D score of 20.0 (Z-score: 0.7) is above the average for the study population and positively correlated with PSQI (0.49), suggesting a potential contribution to poor sleep.
*   **Low Health Satisfaction:** A very low health satisfaction score (1.89, Z-score: -1.78) is significantly below average and negatively correlated with PSQI (-0.21), indicating that dissatisfaction with physical health may be associated with better sleep quality, which might seem counterintuitive but the data suggests a protective effect. However, the strong negative correlation with PSQI suggests that higher health satisfaction would be associated with better sleep.
*   **Shorter Sleep Duration:** A median sleep duration of 6 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score: -1.37) is below the population average, a common indicator of poor sleep quality.
*   **Late Sleep Onset:** A median sleep start time of 02:34:00 AM is indicative of a delayed sleep phase, often associated with poorer sleep.
*   **Elevated Resting Heart Rate and Mesor:** The significantly elevated resting heart rate (77.6, Z-score: 2.31) and Mesor (86.67, Z-score: 1.74) suggest physiological dysregulation that can impact sleep.
*   **Reduced Circadian Rhythm Regularity:** Low interdaily stability (0.17, Z-score: -1.98) and high intradaily variability (0.74, Z-score: 1.37) in heart rate point to a disorganized circadian system, which is strongly linked to poor sleep quality.
*   **High Amplitude of Deviation from Mesor During Sleep Hours:** The significant negative deviations from the mesor during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM) suggest a period of suppressed physiological arousal, which, when combined with other factors like short duration and late onset, may not represent restorative sleep.

Evidence supporting a potentially low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile, representing relatively good or average sleep quality) is limited. While their STAI score indicates low anxiety and their self-esteem is high, these are not as directly indicative of sleep quality as the other factors. The moderate happiness score is also not a strong indicator of either good or poor sleep quality in isolation.

**Holistic Analysis:** The combination of elevated depressive symptoms, significantly disrupted circadian rhythmicity (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability), shorter sleep duration, late sleep onset, and elevated physiological arousal (high resting heart rate) strongly suggests that this participant is likely experiencing poorer sleep quality. The positive correlations of depressive symptoms and stress with PSQI, and the negative correlation of health satisfaction with PSQI, further support the interpretation of suboptimal sleep. Given the population's 50th percentile PSQI score is 6.0, and many of the indicators discussed point towards factors contributing to elevated PSQI scores, it is most probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the top 50th percentile of the study population.

89710,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that likely influence their sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI. Notably, the individual reports significant levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.67) and anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.35), both of which are positively correlated with poorer sleep quality (CES-D correlation = 0.49, STAI correlation = 0.4). These elevated psychological distress markers are accompanied by below-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -1.85) and lower reported happiness (Happy Z-score = -1.61), suggesting a general negative affective state that could disrupt sleep. The participant also reports moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.94). In terms of daily activities, there is a marked tendency towards sedentary behaviors, with substantial time spent on the internet (Internet Usage Z-score = 2.19), listening to music (Listening to Music Z-score = 2.06), and watching videos (Watching TV/Videos/Movies Z-score = 0.64). Conversely, exercise frequency is relatively low, particularly for more vigorous activities.

Analysis of the wearable data reveals distinct patterns in circadian rhythm and physiological arousal. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is notably low (Value = 0.22, Z-score = -1.56), indicating a less regular daily pattern in cardiovascular activity. This is further suggested by a relatively low amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Amplitude Z-score = -1.04), implying less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:57 PM, which aligns with typical diurnal patterns but its stability is compromised by the low interdaily stability. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor highlights periods of increased physiological arousal during the evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 5-6 PM (20.32) and 8-9 PM (14.83), and also between 2-3 AM and 3-4 AM (negative deviations indicating lower than usual heart rate during these times). However, the overall mesor (70.67) and resting heart rate (58.2) are within typical ranges. The participant's median sleep duration is reported as 6 hours and 44 minutes, which is slightly below average for the population (Z-score = -0.56). The standard deviation for sleep duration is within the population norm, suggesting some consistency in sleep length, but the start time shows greater variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = 1.09), indicating irregular sleep timing. The presence of occasional naps is also noted (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = 0.31).

Given the available data, the participant's PSQI score is likely to fall in the top 50th percentile, indicating poorer sleep quality. This assessment is primarily driven by the pronounced elevations in depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are strongly correlated with worse sleep. Coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, these psychological factors represent significant risk factors for poor sleep quality. While the wearable data does not explicitly indicate very short sleep durations or extreme physiological distress during sleep, the low interdaily stability of heart rate and irregular sleep start times suggest disruptions in the regularity and structure of the participant's daily routines and sleep patterns. The moderate alcohol consumption could also contribute to fragmented sleep. Although the resting heart rate and mesor are within normal ranges, the overall constellation of psychological distress, sedentary lifestyle, and disrupted circadian rhythmicity points towards a higher likelihood of experiencing significant sleep complaints.

97596,15.0,0.9947643979057592,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant examination in relation to sleep quality. Notably, a high score on the CES-D scale (33.0, Z-score 2.05) indicates a significant burden of depressive symptoms, a factor known to negatively impact sleep. Concurrently, their STAI-Trait score (47.0, Z-score 0.56) suggests a moderate level of chronic anxiety. While their self-esteem score is within the average range (36.0, Z-score -0.31), and trust levels are below average (-0.78 Z-score), their self-reported happiness is notably low (2.0, Z-score -1.61). This constellation of elevated depressive symptoms, moderate anxiety, and low happiness suggests a potential underlying psychological distress that could manifest in disrupted sleep.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07), a positive habit. However, their engagement in sports is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-score -1.09). They also spend a significant amount of time listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), which could either be a relaxing or a potentially stimulating activity depending on the nature of the music. Other recreational habits, such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and socializing with friends, fall within or below average engagement levels. There is no reported usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the study population (63.6 bpm, Z-score 0.65). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern. During the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), heart rate is significantly lower than the mesor, with deviations of -17.95, -18.27, and -15.65 respectively. This pattern might reflect periods of deeper rest. Conversely, in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM), heart rate deviations are notably positive, reaching 16.29 and 17.13, suggesting a period of increased physiological arousal during this time. The acrophase of their circadian rhythm is noted at 4:14 PM, indicating the peak of their heart rate cycle. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity, such as interdaily stability (0.39, Z-score -0.16), are slightly below average, suggesting some degree of variability in the daily rhythm. Intradaily variability (0.66, Z-score 0.81) is higher than average, indicating more fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes, which is longer than the population average (Z-score 1.22). The standard deviation for sleep duration is also within the average range (60 minutes, Z-score -0.92), suggesting consistent sleep duration on a nightly basis. However, the median sleep start time is quite late, at 00:31:32, with a standard deviation of 90 minutes (Z-score 0.15), indicating some variability in sleep timing. The low average daily naps (0.07, Z-score -0.02) suggests that napping is not a significant factor in their sleep pattern.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine whether the participant's overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population, we will examine the available data for evidence of good or poor sleep.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSQI Score (Bottom 50th Percentile - Relatively Good/Average Sleep Quality):**

*   **Median Sleep Duration:** The participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes, which is a relatively long sleep duration and generally associated with better sleep quality. The Z-score of 1.22 supports this being above the population average.
*   **Sleep Duration Standard Deviation:** A standard deviation of 60 minutes for sleep duration suggests consistency in sleep duration, which is a positive indicator for sleep quality.

**Evidence for a High PSQI Score (Top 50th Percentile - Relatively Poor Sleep Quality):**

*   **Elevated Depressive Symptoms (CES-D):** The CES-D score of 33.0 (Z-score 2.05) is significantly high, classifying the participant as experiencing a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. Depression is a well-established factor that strongly correlates with and contributes to poor sleep quality. The positive correlation of 0.49 between CES-D and PSQI score further supports this link.
*   **Low Self-Reported Happiness:** A very low happiness score (2.0, Z-score -1.61) is also indicative of potential psychological distress that can negatively impact sleep. The negative correlation of -0.26 suggests that lower happiness is associated with higher PSQI scores.
*   **Moderate Anxiety (STAI-Trait):** The STAI-Trait score of 47.0 (Z-score 0.56) indicates a moderate level of chronic anxiety, which can disrupt sleep onset and maintenance. The positive correlation of 0.40 with PSQI further implicates anxiety as a contributing factor to poorer sleep.
*   **Elevated Stress Levels:** The stress score of 32.0 (Z-score 2.83) is exceptionally high, indicating significant stress. Stress is a major contributor to sleep disturbances. The positive correlation of 0.17, while not as strong as depression or anxiety, still suggests a link between higher stress and poorer sleep quality.
*   **Late Sleep Start Time:** The median sleep start time of 00:31:32 is quite late, suggesting a potential delayed sleep phase or difficulty initiating sleep at an earlier hour.
*   **Higher Intradaily Variability:** The higher than average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.81) could reflect less stable physiological regulation throughout the day, potentially impacting sleep.

**Holistic Analysis:**

While the participant reports a relatively long and consistent sleep duration, the overwhelming evidence from psychological and stress-related factors strongly suggests poor sleep quality. The high scores in depressive symptoms, stress, and moderate anxiety, coupled with low happiness, are robust predictors of impaired sleep, as evidenced by their positive correlations with PSQI scores. These psychological factors are likely to manifest in difficulties with sleep initiation, maintenance, or the subjective experience of restfulness, which are central to the PSQI assessment. The late sleep start time also points towards potential sleep timing issues. Therefore, despite the objective duration metrics, the subjective and psychological impact on sleep is likely to be significant.

Considering the strong positive correlations between adverse psychological states (depression, anxiety, stress) and the PSQI, and the notably high levels of these distress indicators for this participant, it is highly probable that their PSQI score reflects poorer sleep quality. This places them in the top 50th percentile of the study population regarding PSQI scores.

Self-reported measures indicate a generally stable psychological profile. Depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 39) are within the ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" classifications, respectively. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES score of 35), and subjective happiness is also on the lower side of the spectrum for this participant (Z-score of -0.53), with a moderate level of trust in others (Z-score of 0.18). Stress levels are reported as moderate (score of 19, Z-score of -0.71), suggesting a lower burden compared to the study population. Academic performance is strong, as indicated by consistently high GPAs across semesters.

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed pattern. Substance use, specifically beer and wine or liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week, which is above average for the study population (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94, respectively). However, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is somewhat limited, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a month and exercising with others not at all, though participation in sports is 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate internet usage (2-3 hours) and listening to music, while sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies and reading are engaged in for shorter durations or not at all. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm.

The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is at 4:00 PM. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.17), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. Intradaily variability is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.25), indicating less fluctuation within a 24-hour period. The resting heart rate is notably low (52.3 bpm, Z-score of -0.7), which is generally associated with good cardiovascular fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a consistent pattern of lower-than-average heart rates during nighttime hours, particularly between 1 AM and 8 AM, with significant negative deviations indicating periods of reduced physiological arousal. During daytime hours, particularly from 8 AM onwards, heart rate deviations become positive, indicating periods of increased physiological activity, with peaks observed between 8-9 AM, 10-11 AM, and again in the evening between 7-10 PM.

Sleep statistics from the wearable device indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-score of 1.18), and a slightly higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around 12:05 AM, with a slight deviation from the population average (standard deviation of 74 minutes). The participant also engages in napping more frequently than the average (Z-score of 1.27). The weak correlations observed between most self-reported and wearable metrics and the PSQI score suggest that no single factor is strongly driving sleep quality in isolation, but rather a confluence of factors may be at play.

Based on the analysis of the provided data, this participant's overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is likely to fall within the **bottom 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors support this conclusion. The participant reports a significantly longer than average sleep duration (8 hours 8 minutes), which is a strong indicator of good sleep. While there is a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration, this does not necessarily negate the positive impact of the longer duration. Furthermore, the participant's psychological profile is generally stable, with low levels of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem. Their resting heart rate is low, suggesting good cardiovascular health. The aggregated heart rate data indicates consistent periods of low physiological arousal during typical sleep hours, which is conducive to sleep. Although they have a slightly higher frequency of substance use (beer and wine/liquor) and more frequent napping than average, these factors do not appear to be strongly negatively correlated with PSQI scores in this dataset. The moderate stress levels and above-average academic performance further suggest a generally functional individual. While the median sleep start time is past midnight, the extended duration compensated for this. The overall pattern of physiological data during the night suggests undisturbed rest.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by moderate levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score 0.17) and subjective happiness (Current happiness score of 4.0, Z-score 0.55), though not indicative of clinical depression (CESD score of 12.0, Z-score -0.14). Their self-esteem is within the average range (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 37.0, Z-score -0.17). Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent performance with a GPA averaging around 3.7. Lifestyle behaviors reveal a tendency towards higher stress levels (Stress score of 25.0, Z-score 0.92) and a lower-than-average satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction score of 5.33, Z-score 0.8). Substance use patterns include moderate consumption of beer and wine or liquor (1-2 times a week for both), with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is notably robust, with the participant exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07) and engaging in sports or exercising with others weekly (Z-score 0.91 and 0.53, respectively). Daily recreational habits indicate minimal engagement in screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less) and video games (none). However, internet usage is exceptionally low (15 minutes or less, Z-score -1.83), and dedicated reading or sedentary hobbies are not reported. Socializing with friends is reported for 16-30 minutes, which is on the lower end (Z-score -1.41).

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate data suggests a generally lower-than-average resting heart rate (Value 47.2, Z-score -1.3), potentially indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of deviation from the mesor. Notably, significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate, are observed during the early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 8 AM, with the most pronounced dips occurring between 2 AM and 3 AM (Value -22.98, Z-score -1.46) and 1 AM and 2 AM (Value -18.04, Z-score -1.46). Conversely, positive deviations, indicating higher than average heart rate, are observed in the late afternoon and early evening, peaking between 4 PM and 6 PM (e.g., 4-5 PM Value 16.95, Z-score 1.21; 5-6 PM Value 17.52, Z-score 1.02). These patterns suggest a chronotype that is not strictly aligned with typical diurnal rhythms, with potentially delayed activity peaks. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a moderate level of interdaily stability (Value 0.37, Z-score -0.33) and low intradaily variability (Value 0.54, Z-score -0.04), suggesting a somewhat regular daily rhythm. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate activity, is noted at 4:37 PM, aligning with the positive deviations observed in the hourly data.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 27 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.33), suggesting adequate sleep duration. However, the sleep duration exhibits moderate variability (Standard Deviation 64 minutes, Z-score -0.84). The median sleep start time is approximately 1:18 AM, which is later than typical, and this also shows considerable variability (Standard Deviation 36 minutes, Z-score -1.02). The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86) is noted.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators that suggest a PSQI score likely falling within the bottom 50th percentile, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Their median sleep duration of 7 hours and 27 minutes is above the population average, which generally correlates with better sleep. While the sleep start time is later than ideal and shows variability, the overall duration is sufficient. The participant's relatively low stress levels (despite a moderate anxiety score), good academic performance, and high engagement in physical activity can all contribute to positive sleep quality. Furthermore, the minimal consumption of alcohol and absence of drug use are favorable factors for sleep. The generally healthy lifestyle choices, including robust exercise routines and limited sedentary recreational activities, further support the notion of good sleep hygiene.

Conversely, there are no strong indicators suggesting a PSQI score in the top 50th percentile (poor sleep quality). While the sleep start time is late, it is not excessively so, and the overall duration is adequate. The observed variability in sleep duration and start time could contribute to a less-than-optimal PSQI score, but these factors are not consistently associated with significantly poor sleep quality across the entire spectrum of PSQI scores. The moderate anxiety score, while present, does not appear to be a dominant factor negatively impacting sleep based on the available data.

In conclusion, a holistic analysis of the evidence, including adequate sleep duration, generally healthy lifestyle behaviors, and moderate physiological stability, suggests that the participant likely has a PSQI score in the bottom half of the distribution.

The participant presents with a moderate level of depressive symptomatology (CES-D Z-score: 0.07), classified as ""Not depressed,"" and low chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62), categorized as ""not anxious."" Self-esteem is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.1 indicating above-average self-worth. While academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is strong (e.g., 3.79 in Spring 2016), trust of others is low (Z-score: -1.42). Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53), and stress levels are moderate (Z-score: -0.44). Health satisfaction is considerably high (Z-score: 1.63), suggesting a positive outlook on physical well-being.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, placing them above the population average in this regard (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is a significant part of their routine, with exercise occurring ""Three times a week or more"" both alone (Z-score: 1.07) and with others (Z-score: 1.23), and sports participation being particularly high (Z-score: 1.58). Daily recreational habits show a preference for listening to music for extended periods (2-3 hours, Z-score: 1.13), with moderate time spent socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16). Time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is minimal, and they do not engage in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Mesor Z-score: -1.9; Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -2.03), suggesting good cardiovascular health or a potentially lower metabolic rate. The mesor of the participant's heart rate rhythm is also notably low (Z-score: -1.9). The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of lower-than-average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -14.01 to -25.76), which is typical for sleep. Conversely, higher-than-average heart rates are observed during the evening and night (e.g., 6-11 PM, with deviations ranging from 8.33 to 18.88), potentially reflecting wakefulness, activity, or physiological responses to late-evening activities.

Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.74), suggesting less consistent daily patterns in heart rate, but a higher intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.23), which may reflect greater fluctuations within a 24-hour period. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.36), indicating a moderate adherence to a daily cycle. The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:57 PM).

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes, which is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.28). The standard deviation for sleep duration is also slightly below average (Z-score: -0.34), suggesting relatively consistent sleep duration from night to night. The median sleep start time is around 12:56 AM, with a standard deviation of 111 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The participant experiences very few daily naps (Z-score: -0.08).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's sleep duration is slightly below the average reported for the study population, with a median duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes. The population's median PSQI score is 6.0, with a 75th percentile of 8.0 and a 25th percentile of 5.0. A higher PSQI score indicates poorer sleep quality.

Several factors could contribute to a potentially higher PSQI score, suggesting poorer sleep quality. The relatively low interdaily stability of the participant's circadian rhythm (Z-score: -0.74) could indicate a less regulated sleep-wake cycle. While sleep duration is only slightly below average, the median sleep start time of 00:56:09, coupled with a substantial standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score: 0.61), suggests variability in bedtime which can negatively impact sleep quality. The higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 1.23) might also reflect physiological disruptions during the day or night that could affect sleep.

Conversely, several factors suggest potentially good or average sleep quality. The participant reports low anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62) and is classified as ""Not depressed"" (CES-D Z-score: 0.07), which are generally associated with better sleep. Their high health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.63) and engagement in regular physical activity, including sports, are positive indicators for sleep. The low resting heart rate and mesor are indicative of good physiological regulation. Furthermore, the relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration suggests consistency, which is a positive aspect of sleep quality.

Considering the data holistically, while there are some indicators of potential sleep disruption, such as the variability in sleep onset and lower interdaily stability, the presence of low anxiety, good health satisfaction, and consistent physical activity are strong counterpoints. The slightly below-average sleep duration is also not a definitive indicator of poor quality on its own. The correlation analysis does not strongly highlight any single metric as a significant predictor of PSQI score. Given the generally positive psychological and behavioral profiles and the fact that the median sleep duration is not drastically low, it is plausible that the participant's PSQI score falls within the average range of the study population.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the participant's PSQI score is likely to be in the bottom half of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

77872,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"This participant exhibits a relatively stable psychological profile with moderate levels of reported depression and anxiety, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" based on their CES-D and STAI scores, respectively. Their self-esteem is above average, as indicated by a Z-score of 0.82. They report average happiness (Z-score of -0.53) and slightly below-average stress levels (Z-score of -0.17). Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score of 0.97).

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, this individual engages in moderate alcohol consumption, with beer consumed 1-2 times a week and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month. They do not report using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is consistent with their social habits, with light participation in exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, but no engagement in sports. Daily recreational activities show a preference for passive entertainment, with limited time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games. Internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends are moderate. Notably, this participant dedicates a significant amount of time to reading (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score of 1.3) and sedentary hobbies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.82), indicating a preference for less physically demanding activities.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a regular circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.4 and an Intradaily Variability of 0.36, indicating a consistent daily pattern in heart rate. The MESOR is 78.69, and the Amplitude is 13.11, reflecting average physiological activity levels. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs around 5:58 PM. The resting heart rate is 57.8, which is within a healthy range. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR shows distinct patterns: a significant dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., -21.24 deviation from 5-6 AM), aligning with typical sleep periods. Conversely, elevated heart rate deviations are observed in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 5-6 PM (20.08 deviation) and 11 PM-12 AM (15.87 deviation), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal or activity towards the end of the day.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 50 minutes, which is slightly below the average for the study population (Z-score of -0.44), suggesting a potential for insufficient sleep. The variability in sleep duration (64 minutes standard deviation) is relatively low, implying consistent sleep patterns on a nightly basis. The median sleep start time is late, at 01:58:30, with a standard deviation of 82 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. There are no reported daily naps, and the participant's sleep patterns appear generally consistent across days, as suggested by the low variability in sleep start time.

The participant's overall PSQI score is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** of the study population. While their median sleep duration is slightly less than average, the evidence for good sleep quality outweighs indicators for poor sleep. Their psychological profile is generally stable and positive, with low depression and anxiety, and high health satisfaction. The wearable data suggests a consistent circadian rhythm and a relatively regulated heart rate pattern throughout the day and night, with clear dips during expected sleep periods. The low variability in sleep duration indicates a consistent sleep schedule. Although the sleep start time is late, the duration itself is not drastically short and the variability is moderate, suggesting that these factors do not severely detract from overall sleep quality to place them in the top half of the PSQI distribution. The moderate positive correlation between sleep duration and PSQI score (0.05) suggests that longer sleep duration is associated with lower PSQI scores (better sleep quality), which is consistent with the participant's slightly below average duration not leading to a significantly high PSQI score.

72348,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a generally low burden of negative psychological symptoms, reporting minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 6.0, Z-score -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 39.0, Z-score -0.23). Self-esteem is also at a moderate level (Score 34.0, Z-score -0.59), aligning with their self-reported happiness (Current 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Trust in others is slightly above average (Score 3.33, Z-score 0.18). Stress levels are reported as moderate (Score 22.0, Z-score 0.1). Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Score 4.89, Z-score 0.47), despite a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.68, which falls into the underweight category.

Behaviorally, this participant reports abstaining from all forms of substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, with Z-scores indicating this is significantly less common than the study population. Exercise habits are also infrequent, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a month, and exercising with others or participating in sports occurring less than 1-2 times a month. However, daily recreational habits indicate significant engagement in screen-based activities: watching TV/videos/movies for 1-2 hours, and internet usage for 3-4 hours. Listening to music occupies about an hour daily, and a sedentary hobby is engaged in for 1-2 hours. Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours daily, and reading for 15 minutes or less.

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a relatively structured and stable circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.65, Z-score 1.99) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.62, Z-score 2.49) are notably high, indicating consistent daily patterns in heart rate. The Mesor (86.31, Z-score 1.69) is also elevated, suggesting a higher average heart rate compared to the population, which is further supported by a high Resting Heart Rate (71.2, Z-score 1.55). The Acrophase occurs around 3:25 PM. The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a typical pattern of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -13.85 to -17.63 deviation from 12 AM to 6 AM), followed by a sharp increase in the morning and day, peaking between 9-10 AM (16.63 deviation). Heart rate then gradually decreases through the afternoon and evening.

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 22 minutes, which is notably longer than the population average, indicated by a high Z-score of 1.48. Furthermore, the standard deviation of sleep duration is low (39 minutes, Z-score -1.4), suggesting consistent sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is late at 23:44:57, with a relatively low standard deviation (26 minutes, Z-score -1.24), indicating a fairly consistent, albeit late, bedtime. There are no reported daily naps (Value 0.0, Z-score -0.86).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's sleep quality, as indicated by the provided data, is likely to fall in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution, suggesting relatively good or average sleep quality.

Several factors support this conclusion. Firstly, the median sleep duration is significantly longer than the population average (8 hours 22 minutes, Z-score 1.48), and the standard deviation of sleep duration is low (39 minutes, Z-score -1.4), indicating consistent and prolonged sleep. This directly addresses key components of good sleep quality. While the sleep start time is late (23:44:57), the low standard deviation suggests a consistent and predictable sleep schedule, which is often associated with better sleep. The absence of daily naps also points towards more consolidated nocturnal sleep.

Furthermore, while the participant engages in high levels of screen-based entertainment and sedentary hobbies, and has infrequent exercise, these behavioral patterns do not appear to be strongly correlated with a negative PSQI score (most correlations are close to zero or slightly positive). More importantly, the psychological profile, characterized by low depressive symptoms, low anxiety, and moderate self-esteem, generally aligns with better sleep quality. While stress is at a moderate level, it does not appear to be a dominant factor negatively impacting sleep in this dataset. The high Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours in heart rate data suggest a well-regulated circadian rhythm, which is fundamental for good sleep. The elevated Mesor and Resting Heart Rate do not have a strong negative correlation with PSQI.

Considering these points, the consistent and prolonged sleep duration, along with the stable circadian rhythm and the absence of significant negative psychological indicators, strongly suggest that this participant's PSQI score would be on the lower end of the distribution, indicating good to average sleep quality.

89607,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Psychologically, the individual reports elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and moderate anxiety (STAI score of 49.0, Z-score 0.76). While self-esteem is at the maximum score for the scale (40.0, Z-score 0.26), indicating high self-worth, the co-occurrence of higher depressive and anxiety symptoms warrants attention. Notably, happiness levels are slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), and trust in others is slightly below average (Z-score -0.46). Health satisfaction is also slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.20).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in regular physical activity, with frequent exercise both alone and with others, and participation in sports occurring ""three times a week or more"" across all categories. This aligns with generally positive health behaviors, though consumption of wine or liquor occurs 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Z-score 0.94). Significant time is allocated to sedentary activities, particularly video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 1.71) and sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41), along with reading for 16-30 minutes. This pattern suggests a balance between active and sedentary pursuits.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant exhibits strong interdaily stability in their heart rate rhythm (Z-score 1.24), indicating a regular daily pattern. However, the intradaily variability is lower than average (Z-score -0.67), suggesting less fluctuation within the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is higher than the population mean (Z-score 0.87), and the resting heart rate is also notably elevated (Z-score 1.24). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a pronounced dip during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score 1.19; 4-5 AM, Z-score 1.05; 5-6 AM, Z-score 0.80), consistent with a natural decrease in physiological arousal during sleep. Conversely, there are significant positive deviations during the midday (e.g., 1-2 PM, Z-score 1.49; 2-3 PM, Z-score 1.12) and early evening (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score 0.33), suggesting periods of higher physiological activity during wakefulness. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is noted at 5:14 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 12 minutes, Z-score 1.26) and a higher than average frequency of napping (0.18 daily naps, Z-score 1.27). The median sleep start time is late at 02:02:30, with moderate variability in sleep start time (42 minutes, Z-score -0.90). The standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low (65 minutes, Z-score -0.81), suggesting consistent sleep durations when sleep does occur.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the provided data, there is evidence to suggest that this participant's PSQI score might fall into the **bottom 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors support this interpretation. Firstly, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 12 minutes, which is longer than the population mean and statistically significantly higher (Z-score 1.26). While the sleep start time is late, the standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low, suggesting consistency in sleep duration on the nights the participant does sleep. The positive correlation between higher sleep duration and lower PSQI scores (implied by the negative correlation of sleep duration with PSQI if it were provided) is a general indicator of better sleep quality.

Furthermore, while the participant reports elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, which are often associated with poor sleep, the positive correlation of CES-D (0.49) and STAI (0.4) with PSQI suggests that higher scores in these areas are associated with worse sleep quality. However, the presence of strong daily routines (indicated by high interdaily stability in heart rate) and regular exercise, alongside above-average happiness, may be mitigating factors for overall sleep quality. The lower-than-average intradaily variability in heart rate, while potentially indicative of less dynamism, could also contribute to a more stable physiological state conducive to sleep. The absence of significant negative correlations between key behavioral and physiological metrics and PSQI score further supports a more favorable sleep quality. The modest negative correlation of Self-Esteem, Trust, Happy, and Health Satisfaction with PSQI hints that higher levels in these domains are associated with better sleep, and this participant scores at or above average on Self-Esteem and Happy, which would suggest better sleep.

Conversely, the late sleep start time and a tendency to nap could be indicative of some sleep dysregulation. However, when considering the overall picture, particularly the extended sleep duration and consistency, the evidence leans towards a PSQI score that is not among the highest in the study. The participant's elevated resting heart rate and higher mesor are notable but do not have a strong negative correlation with PSQI, suggesting their direct impact on overall sleep quality as measured by PSQI might be moderate. Therefore, the participant is more likely to be in the bottom 50% of the distribution for PSQI scores.

59900,14.0,0.9869109947643979,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a notably high median sleep duration of 9 hours and 22 minutes, which is significantly above the study population's mean, as indicated by a Z-score of 2.71. This extended sleep duration is accompanied by a substantial standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score 1.55), suggesting considerable variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is around 12:10 AM, with a standard deviation of 137 minutes (Z-score 1.19), indicating a highly irregular sleep schedule. This irregularity in both sleep duration and timing is potentially detrimental to sleep quality.

Psychologically, the participant reports levels of depression (CES-D score 13) and anxiety (STAI score 37) that are below the clinical threshold and align with the study population's norms (Z-scores of -0.03 and -0.43, respectively). Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11), and perceived happiness is also above average (Z-score 0.55). However, reported stress levels are below average (Z-score -0.71), and health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score -1.2), suggesting a potential disconnect between subjective well-being and physical health perception.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits moderate substance usage, with weekly consumption of beer and wine/liquor (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Notably, there is a complete absence of regular exercise, including solitary exercise, exercise with others, and participation in sports (Z-scores -1.93, -1.58, and -1.09, respectively). Daily recreation includes moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.01) and longer periods of internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.49). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score 0.16).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is within the normal range (Z-score 0.11). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest deviations from the mesor occurring during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, where negative deviations range from -9.2 to -12.77. This period aligns with expected physiological rest. Positive deviations, indicating elevated heart rate relative to the mesor, are observed throughout the day, peaking in the early afternoon (e.g., 1-2 PM with a deviation of 10.32). The cosinor analysis metrics show a moderate Mesor (Z-score -0.39) and amplitude (Z-score -0.81), suggesting a somewhat reduced but present daily rhythm. The acrophase, or peak time, is reported as 4:37 PM. Non-parametric circadian metrics like interdaily stability (Z-score -0.74) and intradaily variability (Z-score -1.16) are relatively low, indicating a less robust and potentially less consistent daily biological rhythm. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.29) further supports a weaker 24-hour periodicity in heart rate.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's PSQI score is assessed in relation to the study population's distribution, which has a mean of 6.7, a median of 6.0, and a 75th percentile of 8.0. The provided data does not include the participant's actual PSQI score. However, several metrics offer indirect insights into potential sleep quality. The extremely long median sleep duration (9 hours 22 minutes, Z-score 2.71) and its high variability (Z-score 1.55), coupled with a highly variable sleep start time (Z-score 1.19), are strong indicators of poor sleep hygiene and likely contribute to a higher PSQI score, suggesting poorer sleep quality. While the participant reports generally low levels of depression and anxiety, their low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.2) could indirectly impact sleep. The lack of any structured physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle are also generally associated with poorer sleep quality.

The low interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate, along with the low autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggest a disrupted circadian rhythm, which is a significant factor in sleep quality. While these are not direct measures of sleep quality, a poorly regulated circadian system often correlates with poorer sleep.

Considering the strong evidence of sleep schedule irregularity, prolonged and variable sleep duration, and disrupted circadian rhythm metrics, it is highly probable that the participant's PSQI score would fall into the upper half of the distribution, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

This participant presents with several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of distress, with a CES-D score of 6.0 (Z-score -0.76), suggesting the absence of significant depressive symptoms. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 32.0 (Z-score -0.92) indicates low chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is at a healthy level, with a score of 40.0 (Z-Score 0.26) representing the maximum possible score. Subjective happiness is slightly below average at 3.0 (Z-Score -0.53), and perceived stress is relatively low at 19.0 (Z-Score -0.71). Health satisfaction is moderately above average at 5.0 (Z-score 0.55) on a 1-7 scale. Behavioral habits include moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a week), with Z-scores indicating usage above the population average, but no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is relatively low (1-2 times a week and 1-2 times a month respectively), and sports participation is also infrequent (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate screen time for watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes) and relatively low engagement with video games (15 minutes or less) and internet usage (31 minutes to an hour). Notably, social interaction with friends is lower than average (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score -0.62).

Wearable data reveals a disrupted circadian rhythm, as indicated by a low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.28, Z-Score: -1.07) and moderate Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.46, Z-Score: -0.6). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value: 0.25, Z-Score: -0.61), further supporting a lack of regularity in daily physiological patterns. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population average (Value: 72.67, Z-Score: -0.17), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also notably low (Value: 8.37, Z-Score: -0.78), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the peak of the heart rate cycle, occurs in the early afternoon (1:27 PM). A resting heart rate of 61.9 (Z-Score: 0.45) is above average. The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. Notably, significant negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate) are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: -11.75, 1-2 AM: -13.47), which is expected during sleep. However, there are substantial positive deviations during late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 7-8 AM: 4.36, 8-9 AM: 9.46, 1-2 PM: 12.98, 2-3 PM: 12.42, 3-4 PM: 13.08), indicating periods of higher physiological activity during these times. Conversely, evening hours show decreasing deviations, culminating in significant negative deviations from 10-11 PM (-7.67) and 11 PM-12 AM (-7.42), suggesting a winding down of activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 45 minutes (Z-Score: -0.53), which is slightly below average, and a sleep duration standard deviation of 45 minutes (Z-Score: -1.26), suggesting relatively consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late at 00:50:24, with a standard deviation of 122 minutes (Z-Score: 0.86), indicating considerable variability in sleep onset. There were no reported daily naps (Value: 0.0, Z-Score: -0.86). The correlation between most self-reported psychological and behavioral variables and the PSQI score are generally weak, with a few notable exceptions. CES-D scores (depression symptoms) and STAI scores (anxiety) show moderate positive correlations with PSQI, suggesting that higher levels of these symptoms are associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction show weak negative correlations with PSQI, indicating a tendency towards better sleep quality with these traits. Stress also shows a weak positive correlation with PSQI.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's PSQI score would likely fall into the **bottom_50** of the study population distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. This assessment is based on a holistic interpretation of the available data. While the median sleep duration is slightly below average, the sleep duration is relatively consistent. The most significant indicators for potentially poorer sleep quality include a late median sleep start time and considerable variability in sleep onset. However, the participant's psychological profile is largely characterized by low distress (low depression and anxiety symptoms), good self-esteem, and moderate happiness and perceived stress, which generally correlate with better sleep quality. The weak positive correlations between depression and anxiety symptoms and the PSQI score, and the weak negative correlations between positive psychological traits (self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) and PSQI, further support a placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution. The disrupted circadian rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability and autocorrelation) might suggest a poorer objective sleep structure, but without a direct PSQI score, the subjective reporting captured by the PSQI is the primary determinant. Given the generally favorable psychological profile and moderate sleep duration, it is more probable that their overall PSQI score would not place them in the top half of poor sleepers.

35347,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally healthy psychological profile, characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.34), low chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02), and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-Score: 0.96). Their self-reported happiness is slightly below average for the study population (Happy Z-Score: -0.53), and they report moderate levels of stress (Stress Z-Score: 0.1). Trust in others is notably low (Trust Z-Score: -2.07), suggesting potential interpersonal difficulties that could impact well-being. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high. Physical health satisfaction is slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.28), and the participant has a low Body Mass Index (17.19).

Regarding lifestyle habits, substance usage is infrequent, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a month, and recreational drugs less than 1-2 times a month. Non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity levels are low, with exercise and sports occurring less than 1-2 times a month or ""Not at all."" Daily sedentary behaviors are prevalent, particularly extensive internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.19) and reading (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 6.21). Socializing with friends is reported as 3-4 hours daily, which is a substantial amount.

The participant's circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable pattern in heart rate, indicated by an Interdaily Stability of 0.45 (Z-Score: 0.33) and Intradaily Variability of 0.55 (Z-Score: 0.03). The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.28, Z-Score: -0.36) suggests a moderate degree of rhythmicity over a 24-hour period. The Mesor (Value: 77.12, Z-Score: 0.43) and Amplitude (Value: 12.72, Z-Score: 0.63) indicate typical physiological parameters, with a resting heart rate of 57.8 bpm (Z-Score: -0.04), slightly below the population average. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is observed around 6:18 PM.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights significant fluctuations throughout the day. Notably, the late evening and early morning hours (12-1 AM and 1-2 AM) show the highest positive deviations from the mesor (8.39 and 4.25, respectively), suggesting periods of elevated cardiovascular activity. Conversely, there is a marked dip in heart rate deviation during the pre-dawn hours (3-4 AM and 4-5 AM), reaching the lowest points (-13.69 and -20.52). A sharp increase in heart rate deviation is observed in the early evening, peaking between 6-7 PM (22.64), aligning with the acrophase. Significant positive deviations also occur later in the evening (9-10 PM and 10-11 PM), indicating periods of potential arousal.

Sleep statistics indicate a generous median sleep duration of 8 hours and 29 minutes, which is above the population average (Z-Score: 1.61). However, the variability in sleep duration is also higher than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation: 146 minutes, Z-Score: 1.04). The median sleep start time is very late, at 2:12 AM, and while the standard deviation of sleep start times is within a moderate range (56 minutes, Z-Score: -0.6), the overall late start suggests potential chronotype or behavioral influences on sleep timing. The participant also reports a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.3, Z-Score: 2.66).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, the participant's sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), is likely to fall within the **bottom 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

Several factors support this conclusion. The participant reports a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, which are often associated with poor sleep quality. Their high self-esteem is also a positive indicator. While self-reported happiness is slightly below average, this single metric does not strongly suggest a significantly impaired sleep profile. Their academic performance is consistently high, which typically requires effective cognitive function, often supported by adequate sleep.

Physiologically, while there are notable fluctuations in hourly heart rate deviations, particularly a sharp increase in the early evening and later at night, the overall circadian rhythm metrics (Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability) suggest a reasonable degree of regularity. The resting heart rate is within a healthy range.

Crucially, the participant reports a median sleep duration significantly longer than the population average, which is a strong indicator of good sleep quantity. While the variability in sleep duration and the late sleep onset are noted, the substantial duration of sleep itself is a primary determinant of good sleep quality. The relatively low frequency of substance use and a lack of non-prescribed drug use are also favorable for sleep.

While the participant engages in significant amounts of internet usage and reading, which are sedentary activities, and has low levels of physical activity, these behaviors do not directly and strongly correlate with a high PSQI score in the provided data. Furthermore, the PSQI score correlations for many of these factors are close to zero or weakly negative, suggesting limited impact on sleep quality according to this participant's data. The positive correlation between depression and PSQI score (0.49) and anxiety and PSQI score (0.4) are moderate, but the participant's scores in these areas are below average, mitigating their potential negative impact on the PSQI score.

Considering the substantial sleep duration and the absence of strong indicators of severe sleep disturbance, it is most probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the lower half of the distribution.

45641,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral indicators that are pertinent to sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports a high level of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 22.0 (Z-score: 0.9), placing them in the ""Depressed"" classification. This is accompanied by elevated trait anxiety, with an STAI score of 46.0 (Z-score: 0.46). In contrast, their self-esteem is relatively lower than the population average, evidenced by a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 32.0 (Z-score: -0.87). General happiness levels are also below average (Z-score: -0.53), and while trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.18), satisfaction with physical health is notably low (Z-score: -1.45). Stress levels are moderately elevated (Z-score: 0.38).

Behaviorally, the participant reports minimal engagement in substance use and a low frequency of exercise, including exercising alone, with others, and participation in sports. Their daily recreational habits are dominated by screen-based activities: significant time is spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64), playing video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score: 0.96), and using the internet (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85). Listening to music also occupies a notable portion of their day (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.67). There is limited social interaction with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.41) and a lack of engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. The participant’s Body Mass Index (BMI) is 25.85, which is on the higher end of a healthy weight range.

Physiologically, as assessed by wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits a higher than average interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.41), suggesting a more consistent daily pattern in heart rate. However, intradaily variability is below average (Z-score: -0.53), potentially indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is elevated (Z-score: 0.83), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also above average (Z-score: 0.81). The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (5:58 PM). Resting heart rate is also elevated (Z-score: 0.6). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals notable patterns of physiological arousal: significant positive deviations are observed in the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM, 11 PM-12 AM, 12-1 AM), suggesting higher than typical cardiovascular activity during these periods. Conversely, substantial negative deviations are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM, 8-9 AM), indicating periods of lower than typical cardiovascular activity.

In terms of sleep statistics, the median sleep duration is relatively long at 7 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score: 0.89). The variability in sleep duration is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.02). However, the median sleep start time is late, at 01:59:30, and the variability in sleep start times is below average (Z-score: -0.73). There are no reported daily naps.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents several indicators that could influence their PSQI score, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, the median sleep duration is relatively long (7 hours 54 minutes), which typically correlates with better sleep quality. The interdaily stability of their heart rate is high, suggesting some regularity in their daily physiological patterns. Their lower than average health satisfaction and elevated stress levels, alongside significant depressive symptoms and anxiety, are generally associated with poorer sleep quality. The late median sleep start time and elevated heart rate during late evening and nighttime hours are also red flags for disrupted sleep.

Considering the population PSQI distribution, where the 75th percentile is 8.0, a PSQI score above 8.0 would place an individual in the top 50% (poorer sleep quality). A score of 6.0 represents the median.

The participant's elevated stress, depression, and anxiety scores are strongly correlated with poorer sleep quality (CES-D: 0.49, STAI: 0.4). The late sleep onset and increased physiological arousal in the evening/night are also detrimental to sleep. While sleep duration is adequate, the timing and internal physiological state suggest potential disturbances that the PSQI would capture. The moderate to high levels of screen time and limited social engagement may also contribute to poorer sleep. Given these factors, it is likely that the participant's PSQI score would fall into the higher range, indicating poorer sleep quality.

64572,6.0,0.387434554973822,"The participant presents with generally low levels of psychological distress. Their CES-D score is substantially below the population mean, indicating minimal recent depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score suggests a low propensity for chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is slightly above average, and self-reported happiness is close to the population mean, suggesting a relatively stable and positive psychological outlook. Stress levels are near the population average, without significant deviation. Trust in others is slightly elevated compared to the population, and health satisfaction is also slightly above average. The participant reports no substance usage for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, indicating a low-risk behavioral profile in this regard.

Regarding physical activity and daily habits, the participant engages in exercise alone 1-2 times a week, with less frequent participation in exercise with others or sports. This pattern suggests a moderate engagement with physical activity, primarily as an individual pursuit. Daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate engagement with watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and slightly longer durations for internet usage and socializing with friends. Time spent on listening to music and reading is relatively brief, with reading at 15 minutes or less daily. This combination of habits indicates a balanced, though not exceptionally active, lifestyle.

Wearable data reveals a highly regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability score, significantly above the population average. This suggests a consistent daily pattern in physiological activity. Intradaily Variability is close to the population average, indicating a typical pattern of fluctuation within a 24-hour period. The Mesor, representing the mid-point of the circadian rhythm, is slightly below the population average, as is the Resting Heart Rate, suggesting a potentially lower baseline physiological arousal. The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average, indicating a greater difference between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. The Acrophase, or the time of peak heart rate, is reported as 4:57 PM, aligning with typical diurnal patterns.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. During late night and early morning hours (10 PM to 7 AM), heart rate consistently deviates negatively from the Mesor, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 2 AM and 6 AM, reaching as low as -24.75% deviation. This is indicative of a period of reduced physiological arousal during typical sleep hours. Conversely, during the afternoon and evening (approximately 12 PM to 10 PM), heart rate deviations are predominantly positive and increasingly so in the late evening, peaking at 23.64% deviation between 8 PM and 9 PM. This suggests heightened physiological activity during these periods, potentially reflecting an active wakeful state.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the population average, and the Sleep Duration Standard Deviation suggests moderate consistency in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is approximately 12:43 AM, which is later than the population average, and the Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation indicates some variability in bedtime. The participant reports no daily naps.

The participant's psychological profile is characterized by low distress, moderate physical activity with a preference for individual exercise, and moderate engagement in common recreational activities. Their circadian rhythm, as inferred from heart rate data, appears to be highly structured and regular, with a lower resting heart rate and a slightly higher amplitude of daily heart rate variation. The observed sleep duration is below average, and sleep onset tends to be late with some variability.

Given the PSQI population data (Mean: 6.73, SD: 2.16, 75th percentile: 8.0), the participant's sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, while below the population average, is closer to the median (6.0) and 25th percentile (5.0) than the upper end of the distribution. The late sleep start time and its variability could contribute to poorer sleep quality. However, the strong interdaily stability in heart rate suggests a regular daily routine, which can be conducive to good sleep. The low stress and anxiety levels are also positive indicators for sleep quality. Without a direct PSQI score, the interpretation must rely on the correlation of provided metrics with sleep quality. The modest negative correlations of self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction with PSQI scores suggest that higher levels of these traits are associated with better sleep quality. The positive correlation of stress with PSQI suggests higher stress predicts poorer sleep. The participant scores well on these positive indicators. The negative correlation of sleep duration with PSQI indicates shorter sleep predicts poorer sleep, which is a concern here. The positive correlation of sleep start time variability with PSQI indicates greater variability predicts poorer sleep, also a concern. However, the strong circadian stability and low psychological distress are significant protective factors. The median sleep duration, though below average, is not extremely short.

Considering the available data, the participant's sleep duration is a potential area of concern, as is the variability in sleep start time. However, the strong evidence of psychological well-being (low depression, anxiety, and near-average happiness) and the highly stable circadian rhythm are significant factors suggesting relatively good sleep. The participant's sleep duration is closer to the population median than the lowest quartile, and while the sleep start time is late, its variability is moderate. The positive correlations of self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction with better sleep (lower PSQI) are favorable for this participant. The positive correlation of stress with poorer sleep is also favorable as the participant has low stress. Overall, the evidence leans towards the participant having a PSQI score that is not in the highest quartile of poor sleep.

28312,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"This participant exhibits moderate levels of psychological distress and engagement in certain lifestyle behaviors, which appear to have minimal direct correlation with their sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Their CES-D score is within the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a Z-score of 0.07, suggesting no significant burden of depressive symptoms. However, they report higher-than-average chronic anxiety, indicated by an STAI score of 48.0 (Z-score 0.66). Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45), and reported happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55). Stress levels are moderately elevated (Z-score 0.38). Health satisfaction is slightly lower than the study mean (Z-score -0.2).

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant reports consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively, placing them in the higher percentile for substance usage compared to the study population. Notably, they report no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is low, with ""Exercised Alone"" and ""Exercised with Others"" reported as 1-2 times a month (Z-scores -0.43 and -0.17 respectively), and ""Sports"" frequency is ""Not at all"" (Z-score -1.09), indicating significantly less engagement in physical activity than the average participant. Daily recreation habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and socializing with friends (Z-scores around 0.15-0.01), with less time spent on video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies.

The wearable data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm, though with some notable characteristics. Interdaily Stability is moderately high (Z-score 0.33), suggesting a consistent daily pattern. Intradaily Variability is within the average range (Z-score -0.11). The Mesor (average heart rate) is elevated (Z-score 1.3), and the Amplitude is also notably high (Z-score 1.54), indicating larger fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:32 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.42). Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates a pattern of significantly lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score -0.85; 4-5 AM, Z-score -0.89), and significantly higher than average heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, Z-score 1.65; 6-7 PM, Z-score 0.78). This pattern, particularly the low heart rate during deep sleep and the pronounced increase in the late afternoon/early evening, suggests a robust but perhaps intense circadian drive.

In terms of sleep statistics, the median sleep duration is 7 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score 0.51), which is slightly longer than the study average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also higher than average (Z-score 0.51), suggesting some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is quite late at 01:23:30, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is slightly lower than average (Z-score -0.54), indicating a relatively consistent, albeit delayed, sleep onset. The number of daily naps is minimal (Z-score 0.04). The weak correlations observed between most individual metrics and the PSQI score suggest that no single factor overwhelmingly dictates overall sleep quality in this participant.

Based on the provided data, it is difficult to definitively place this participant in the top or bottom 50% of the PSQI distribution without knowing their actual PSQI score. However, several factors suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality, placing them towards the **top_50** percentile. While their median sleep duration is adequate, the high amplitude of their heart rate rhythm and elevated Mesor could indicate physiological stress or arousal that interferes with sleep consolidation. The late median sleep start time, coupled with the variability in sleep duration, also points to potential sleep schedule issues. Furthermore, the elevated anxiety levels (STAI score) are a known contributor to poor sleep quality. While their CES-D score is low, the combination of anxiety, late sleep onset, and potential physiological dysregulation suggests a higher likelihood of experiencing sleep difficulties that would result in a poorer PSQI score compared to the study average. The generally weak correlations with PSQI in the provided data make it challenging to rely solely on these for a definitive placement, but the overall pattern of elevated anxiety and potential physiological disruptions leans towards a higher PSQI score.

56805,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, offering insights into their overall well-being and sleep patterns. Psychologically, the individual reports very low levels of both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 1.0, Z-score of -1.28) and anxiety (STAI score of 20.0, Z-score of -2.11), indicating a stable and generally calm emotional state. Conversely, they exhibit higher than average self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 50.0, Z-Score of 1.66) and happiness (Happy score of 5.0, Z-Score of 1.64), suggesting a positive self-perception and contentment. Trust in others is also moderately elevated (Trust score of 3.67, Z-Score of 0.83). While health satisfaction is notably high (Health Satisfaction score of 7.0, Z-score of 2.05), stress levels are reported as average (Stress score of 21.0, Z-Score of -0.17). The participant abstains from all forms of substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs. Their exercise habits involve moderate solitary activity (Exercised Alone: '1-2 times a week') but significant engagement in group exercise and sports ('Three times a week or more'), reflected in positive Z-scores for these activities. Daily recreational habits indicate minimal engagement with passive screen time (Watching TV/Videos/Movies, Video Games, Internet Usage) and a complete absence of listening to music, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is reported as '31 minutes an hour', suggesting moderate social interaction.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, this participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (44.2 bpm, Z-score of -1.66), which is indicative of a good level of cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals moderate interdaily stability (Value of 0.3, Z-Score of -0.9) and near-average intradaily variability (Value of 0.54, Z-Score of -0.04), suggesting a somewhat regular daily physiological pattern. The MESOR, representing the midpoint of the circadian rhythm, is lower than average (Value of 64.45, Z-Score of -1.3). The hourly deviations from the mesor highlight a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 am: -23.62, 3-4 am: -28.48, 4-5 am: -30.64), which is a typical pattern associated with sleep. Conversely, there are notable peaks in heart rate during mid-morning (8-9 am: 14.6, 10-11 am: 18.31) and evening hours (6-7 pm: 15.96, 8-9 pm: 13.5). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the rhythm, occurs at 3:10 PM.

Sleep statistics reveal significant deviations from population norms, primarily in the duration and timing of sleep. The median sleep duration is considerably shorter than average at 5 hours and 33 minutes (Z-score of -2.02), suggesting a substantial deficit in sleep quantity. The median sleep start time is also notably late, at approximately 1:20 AM (Median Sleep Start Time), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is 54 minutes, indicating some variability in bedtime. There is no evidence of daily napping, suggesting that the limited sleep duration is not being compensated for during the day. The low sleep duration is particularly concerning given the participant's otherwise positive psychological profile and good physical health indicators.

Based on the available data, the participant's sleep quality is likely to be in the lower half of the distribution. The most significant indicator of potentially poor sleep quality is the substantially reduced median sleep duration (5 hours 33 minutes), which is two standard deviations below the population mean. This limited sleep duration is strongly correlated with reduced overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. While the participant reports generally good psychological well-being, high self-esteem, and low anxiety, these positive traits may be masking or coexisting with underlying sleep issues. The lack of napping further suggests that this sleep deficit is not being mitigated. The late sleep onset time also contributes to a potentially disrupted sleep schedule. Although other factors such as exercise habits are positive, the core metric of sleep duration points towards a problematic sleep pattern. Considering the population's average PSQI score is 6.73 with a 75th percentile of 8.0, a consistent sleep duration of under 6 hours would strongly suggest a PSQI score above the 50th percentile.

26800,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"This participant presents with a generally stable psychological and behavioral profile, with a few notable areas that may influence sleep quality. Self-report data indicate a low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score -0.66) and a below-average level of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 40.0, Z-score -0.13). Self-esteem is measured as above average (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 45.0, Z-score 0.96), though the interpretation of this specific scale score is reversed, suggesting potential misunderstanding or an unusual scoring convention, as higher scores typically indicate greater self-esteem. Trust levels are close to the population mean (Score 3.17, Z-score -0.14), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Stress levels are also near the population average (Score 21.0, Z-score -0.17). Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score 4.0, Z-score -0.2). The participant reports moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are infrequent, with sports participation occurring 1-2 times per week, but solo exercise and exercise with others being notably low. Daily recreational habits are largely sedentary, with minimal engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, or reading, and moderate internet usage (1-2 hours) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours).

Wearable data reveals a heart rate mesor of 67.3 bpm (Z-score -0.91), which is lower than the population average, suggesting a generally lower resting cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also low (8.0, Z-score -0.9), indicating less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at approximately 4:08 PM, which is within a typical diurnal pattern. Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.3, Z-score -0.9), suggesting some irregularity in daily rhythmicity, while intradaily variability is moderate (0.47, Z-score -0.53). The hourly deviation from the mesor in heart rate shows significant increases during typical work/activity hours (e.g., 9-10 AM: 20.89, Z-score 2.2; 10-11 AM: 14.86, Z-score 1.43) and decreases during typical sleep hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -15.81, Z-score 0.08; 4-5 AM: -21.8, Z-score -0.61). This pattern aligns with expected physiological responses to wakefulness and sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score 0.06), which is very close to the population mean. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 94 minutes (Z-score -0.15), suggesting some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is notably late at 1:28 AM (approximately 13 hours after midnight), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is 89 minutes (Z-score 0.13), indicating a consistent but late sleep schedule with some nightly variation. The participant averages very few daily naps (0.07, Z-score -0.02). The correlation analysis shows weak to negligible relationships between most survey and wearable metrics and the PSQI score, with a few exceptions. A positive correlation is observed between CES-D score and PSQI score (0.49), suggesting that higher depressive symptom burden is associated with poorer sleep quality, though the participant's CES-D score is low. Similarly, stress levels show a weak positive correlation (0.2). Conversely, higher self-esteem (if the reversed interpretation is ignored) and trust are weakly negatively correlated (-0.35 and -0.21, respectively), indicating a trend towards better sleep quality with higher self-esteem and trust. Interestingly, higher alcohol consumption (wine/liquor) shows a weak positive correlation with PSQI score (0.06), but the participant's intake is moderate.

Overall, the participant exhibits several factors that could contribute to sleep quality. Their psychological profile is largely within normal ranges, with no significant indicators of depression or high anxiety. However, the late median sleep start time and some variability in sleep duration, coupled with low interdaily stability in heart rate rhythmicity, might point towards suboptimal sleep patterns. The moderate consumption of alcohol and sedentary lifestyle could also play a role. While most individual metrics do not strongly correlate with PSQI, the general trend of a late sleep onset, some variability in sleep duration, and a slightly below-average happiness score suggest a potential for moderate sleep disturbance. Given that the median sleep duration is adequate, and psychological distress is low, the primary concern seems to be the timing and consistency of sleep.

Considering the provided data and the correlations, the participant's PSQI score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the distribution. While the late sleep start time is a concern, the absence of significant depressive or anxious symptoms, adequate average sleep duration, and generally low resting heart rate and moderate happiness levels suggest that their sleep quality, while not exceptional, is likely not in the severely impaired range. The weak positive correlation of CES-D with PSQI indicates that their low CES-D score would favor a better PSQI score. The correlations with self-esteem and trust, which are near average to above average for self-esteem, also suggest a tendency towards better sleep quality. The median sleep duration being just above 7 hours is also a positive indicator. The data does not strongly indicate a high PSQI score (poor sleep quality) that would place them in the top 50% of the distribution.

47142,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"This participant presents with a notable pattern of moderate psychological distress, coupled with suboptimal sleep and activity metrics that collectively suggest a potentially compromised overall sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports a CES-D score of 19.0, classified as ""Depressed,"" with a positive correlation to PSQI score (0.5), indicating that higher depressive symptom burden is associated with poorer sleep quality. Concurrently, a STAI score of 43.0 suggests a tendency towards anxiety, showing a moderate positive correlation (0.4) with PSQI. While self-esteem is within the average range (Score: 35.0, Z-score: -0.45), and reported happiness is somewhat lower (Score: 3.0, Z-score: -0.53), the presence of depressive symptoms is a significant factor to consider in relation to sleep. Stress levels are also elevated (Score: 20.0, Z-score: -0.44), with a slight positive correlation (0.2) to PSQI. Health satisfaction is low (Score: 3.0, Z-score: -0.95), which may reflect or contribute to the observed sleep and psychological patterns.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a sedentary lifestyle with minimal engagement in physical activities. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all,"" with highly negative Z-scores across all categories, suggesting a significant deviation from the study population norms in this aspect. Exercise habits are limited, with no participation in sports or exercising with others, and only infrequent solo exercise (1-2 times a week). Daily recreational habits are dominated by prolonged internet usage (""31 minutes an hour"") and moderate listening to music (16-30 minutes), with minimal time dedicated to reading or socializing. Notably, the participant reports ""Do not do"" for watching TV/videos/movies and a low duration for video games, indicating a preference for screen-based activities that are not purely passive entertainment. This pattern of low physical activity and passive screen time may contribute to difficulties with sleep regulation.

The wearable-derived physiological data reveal a highly irregular circadian rhythm, likely impacting sleep quality. The Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.54, Z-Score: 1.08) is relatively high, suggesting a degree of consistency in daily patterns, yet the Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.36, Z-Score: -1.31) is low, which is counterintuitive and suggests a lack of robust daily fluctuations in heart rate. However, the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.5, Z-Score: 1.48) is notably high, indicating a strong daily periodicity in heart rate. The Mesor (Value: 83.59, Z-Score: 1.32) is significantly elevated above the population mean, suggesting a higher average heart rate throughout the day. This is further supported by the high Resting Heart Rate (Value: 65.1, Z-Score: 0.83). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the Mesor, particularly during the late night and early morning hours. From 2 AM to 6 AM, the heart rate deviation is notably negative, reaching its lowest point between 4-5 AM (-22.67), which could indicate prolonged periods of low physiological arousal that are not conducive to restorative sleep or are indicative of a disrupted sleep architecture. Conversely, heart rates tend to be higher than the Mesor in the evening and early morning waking hours, with peak positive deviations observed between 7 PM and 10 PM.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes, which is below the average for the population and associated with a negative Z-score (-0.81), aligning with the observed psychological and physiological patterns. The median sleep start time is late at 1:39 AM, with a standard deviation of 69 minutes, suggesting variability in bedtime. The participant also engages in frequent napping (Mean Daily Naps: 0.3, Z-Score: 2.66), which can disrupt nocturnal sleep. The correlations provided suggest that depressive symptoms (CESD, r=0.5) and anxiety (STAI, r=0.4) have the strongest positive associations with PSQI score, indicating that these psychological states are key contributors to poorer sleep quality in this individual. While the direct correlations for many behavioral and physiological metrics are weak, the confluence of elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, sedentary lifestyle, and a disturbed circadian rhythm characterized by a high Mesor and significant deviations from it during sleep hours, points towards a significant impairment in sleep quality.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant’s sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is likely to fall into the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. The presence of moderate depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with a significantly late and variable sleep schedule, below-average sleep duration, and frequent napping, strongly suggests difficulties in achieving restorative sleep. While some physiological metrics like interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours indicate a degree of regularity, the high Mesor and pronounced negative deviations in heart rate during hypothesized sleep periods, along with the limited engagement in physical activity and social interaction, further underscore potential sleep disturbances. The positive correlations of CESD and STAI scores with PSQI further reinforce the notion that psychological distress is a significant driver of poor sleep for this participant, pushing their overall PSQI score into the higher (worse) range.

60396,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally healthy psychological profile, with a CES-D score suggesting no significant depressive symptoms (Z = -0.55) and a relatively high Self-Esteem score (Z = -0.73). Anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, are noted as within a range that might be classified as ""anxious"" (Z = 0.07), but this score is close to the population mean. Reported happiness levels are above average (Z = 0.55), and trust in others is notably high (Z = 1.15). Stress levels are slightly below the population average (Z = -0.17). Health satisfaction is also elevated (Z = 0.88), aligning with a relatively healthy BMI of 24.36.

Behavioral habits reveal moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, aligning with above-average population Z-scores for these categories. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all,"" with Z-scores indicating lower-than-average usage. Exercise patterns show a mix of activities: exercising alone occurs 1-2 times a week, while exercising with others is more frequent, occurring three times a week or more (Z = 1.23). Sports participation is infrequent, occurring less than 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate engagement with screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games (both around 16-30 minutes). Internet usage and listening to music are reportedly minimal or not engaged in, with significantly low Z-scores. Socializing with friends and reading also show below-average engagement times.

Wearable data reveals several important physiological and circadian rhythm characteristics. The participant's resting heart rate is relatively low (Z = -1.04), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a mesor (average heart rate) that is below the population mean (Z = -1.11), and an amplitude that is also slightly below average (Z = -0.2). The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:52 PM. Notably, intradaily variability in heart rate is significantly low (Z = -1.45), suggesting a highly regular and stable daily pattern of physiological activity. Conversely, interdaily stability is also low (Z = -0.24), which might indicate less consistent day-to-day synchronization of daily routines. However, the autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (Z = 1.57), suggesting a strong tendency for daily patterns to repeat. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows deviations from the mesor that are generally lower during nighttime hours (e.g., -24.02% deviation between 5-6 am), increasing significantly during the late evening and early night (e.g., 18.95% deviation between 8-9 pm). This pattern suggests a typical diurnal heart rate variation, with a notable increase in the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 23 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z = 0.26). The variability in sleep duration is below the population average (Z = -0.69), suggesting more consistent nightly sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is late at 1:46 AM, with low variability in start times (Z = -0.66). The frequency of daily naps is minimal (Z = -0.08).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's PSQI group, we will examine the available data in relation to their likely PSQI score. The population mean PSQI score is 6.73, with a 50th percentile of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score above 6.0 generally indicates poorer sleep quality.

The participant exhibits several factors that might correlate with better sleep quality, placing them in the **bottom_50** percentile. Their median sleep duration of 7 hours and 23 minutes is above average, and the low variability in sleep duration (Z = -0.69) and sleep start time (Z = -0.66) suggests good sleep regularity. Low Intradaily Variability (Z = -1.45) in heart rate also points towards a stable circadian rhythm. Furthermore, their psychological profile is generally positive, with no significant depressive symptoms and high self-esteem.

Conversely, the late median sleep start time (1:46 AM) could be indicative of a delayed sleep phase, which can contribute to poorer sleep quality for individuals whose schedules demand earlier wake times. However, the low variability in sleep start time suggests this late sleep schedule is consistent for the participant. The correlations provided offer some guidance: several metrics associated with potentially better sleep quality (e.g., low stress, higher happiness, better health satisfaction) have negative correlations with PSQI score, meaning higher values of these metrics are associated with lower PSQI scores (better sleep). While the direct PSQI score is not provided, the preponderance of evidence leans towards a PSQI score that would fall within the better half of the distribution.

This participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of self-reported depression (CES-D Z-score: -1.07) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.92), along with a healthy self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.82). Their reported happiness is notably high (Z-score: 1.64), and stress levels are considerably low (Z-score: -1.53), suggesting a generally positive psychological disposition. Lifestyle behaviors indicate consistent physical activity, with exercise reported three times a week or more both alone and with others, and participation in sports 1-2 times a week. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement with passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes) and listening to music (15 minutes or less), with minimal engagement in internet usage, video games, reading, or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is also reported as limited (16-30 minutes). The participant has an excellent academic record, with all reported GPAs at 4.0. Health satisfaction is above average (Z-score: 0.63).

From a physiological and circadian perspective, the participant's resting heart rate is relatively low (Value: 53.0, Z-score: -0.61), suggesting good cardiovascular health. Cosinor analysis of their heart rate data reveals a mesor of 67.41 bpm (Z-score: -0.89) and an amplitude of 13.08 bpm (Z-score: 0.74). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the daily heart rate rhythm, occurs around 6:03 PM. The interdaily stability of their heart rate is moderate (Value: 0.43, Z-score: 0.17), and intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Value: 0.66, Z-score: 0.81), suggesting a less regular daily pattern in heart rate fluctuations. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor during the late evening and nighttime hours. Specifically, between 2 AM and 7 AM, there are notable negative deviations, reaching a minimum of -20.52 bpm between 6-7 AM, indicating lower-than-average heart rate during these early morning hours. Conversely, a substantial positive deviation occurs between 5 PM and 11 PM, peaking at +39.22 bpm between 5-6 PM, and remaining elevated throughout the evening hours, suggesting higher cardiovascular arousal during this period. This pattern, with a late evening acrophase and pronounced nighttime dips, might indicate a delayed or disrupted circadian signal impacting heart rate.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score: 0.76), which is longer than the average in the study population. The standard deviation for sleep duration is relatively low (Value: 62 minutes, Z-score: -0.87), suggesting consistency in sleep length. The median sleep start time is around 12:54 AM, which is later than typical, and the standard deviation for sleep start time is moderate (Value: 49 minutes, Z-score: -0.74), indicating some variability in bedtime. Notably, there are no reported daily naps (Value: 0.0, Z-score: -0.86). The correlation analysis provides some suggestive insights: a positive correlation is observed between stress levels and PSQI score (0.19), while higher self-esteem (-0.35) and happiness (-0.26) are negatively correlated with PSQI score. Lower depression scores are positively correlated with PSQI score (0.49), and lower anxiety scores are also positively correlated (0.4). This implies that traits associated with better mental well-being tend to be associated with better sleep quality, though these correlations are modest.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Analyzing the provided data in relation to the participant's PSQI score distribution, we observe several key indicators. The population PSQI scores range with a mean of 6.73, a median of 6.0, and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score of 6 or below would generally be considered in the bottom 50% (good to average sleep quality), while a score above 6 would fall into the top 50% (poor sleep quality).

Evidence supporting a potentially lower PSQI score (bottom 50%) includes the participant's generally positive psychological profile: low stress (Z-score: -1.53), high happiness (Z-score: 1.64), good self-esteem (Z-score: 0.82), and low reported depression and anxiety. These factors are often associated with better sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports a longer-than-average sleep duration (7 hours 48 minutes, Z-score: 0.76) with relatively consistent nightly lengths (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.87), which typically contributes to good sleep. Their excellent academic performance and lack of substance use also point towards stable lifestyle habits that can support healthy sleep.

However, there are also indicators that might suggest a PSQI score in the upper half of the distribution (top 50%), signifying poorer sleep quality. The median sleep start time of approximately 12:54 AM, coupled with the elevated positive deviations in heart rate during the late evening (peaking at 5-6 PM and remaining elevated until 11 PM) and pronounced negative deviations during the early morning hours, suggests a potential disruption in the natural circadian rhythm and sleep-wake timing. The intraday variability of heart rate is also somewhat elevated (Z-score: 0.81), indicating less regularity in daily physiological patterns, which can negatively impact sleep quality. While the absolute sleep duration is good, the timing and physiological patterns during sleep hours may be contributing to a less restorative sleep experience. The moderate, though positive, correlation between stress and PSQI score (0.19) and the positive correlation between CES-D score and PSQI score (0.49) suggest that even mild increases in these negative psychological states might have a discernible impact on sleep quality.

Considering the balance of evidence, the participant exhibits several traits and behaviors strongly associated with good sleep quality, such as low psychological distress and adequate sleep duration. However, the observed physiological patterns, particularly the late sleep start time and the pronounced heart rate deviations during nighttime hours, coupled with the elevated intradaily variability in heart rate, raise concerns about the structural quality and timing of their sleep. While the duration is sufficient, the regularity and alignment with circadian rhythms may be suboptimal. The positive correlations of stress and depressive symptoms with PSQI, even if modest, suggest that these factors are not entirely absent in their potential impact on sleep. Given the moderate nature of the correlations and the strong indicators of overall well-being, it is more likely that the physiological timing irregularities, while present, are not severe enough to push their PSQI score into the definitively poor sleep category. The substantial duration and consistency in sleep, alongside the generally positive psychological state, likely place them towards the better end of the spectrum.

Therefore, a holistic analysis suggests the participant's PSQI score is likely to fall in the bottom 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

92038,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a profile characterized by relatively low levels of psychological distress and a generally healthy lifestyle, which may be indirectly influencing their sleep quality. Their self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.18) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02), suggesting a stable psychological state. Furthermore, they report high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.66) and happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64), aligning with a positive self-perception. While their reported stress levels are moderate (Stress Z-score: -0.44), their high satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.3) suggests a proactive approach to well-being.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in regular exercise, with both solitary and group exercise occurring at a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07, Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23). Their substance usage, specifically beer and wine or liquor, is at a moderate level (""1-2 times a week,"" Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Their daily recreational habits lean towards less passive activities, with minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, video games, or general internet usage (all Z-scores below -0.56). Notably, they dedicate time to reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score: 1.3) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16), indicating a balanced engagement in leisure activities.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant demonstrates a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.16) is close to the population mean, suggesting consistent daily patterns. However, the intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.23) is notably higher than average, implying more fluctuations in heart rate within a 24-hour period. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals a typical pattern of lower heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, deviations of -20.76 and -22.66 respectively), indicating periods of rest. Conversely, the highest deviations from the mesor occur in the mid-afternoon (3-4 PM, 25.31 and 4-5 PM, 25.31), suggesting a peak in physiological arousal during this time. Their resting heart rate (Value: 53.4, Z-score: -0.56) is lower than the population average, which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 36 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.52). However, the variability in sleep duration is higher than average (Z-score: 1.0), suggesting some inconsistency in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:27 AM, with a considerable standard deviation of 114 minutes (Z-score: 0.69), indicating significant variability in when they initiate sleep. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86) suggests a lack of overt sleepiness during the day.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a tendency towards the lower half of the PSQI distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. Psychologically, their low reported levels of depression and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, are typically associated with better sleep. Their generally healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and moderate substance use, also correlates with positive sleep outcomes.

From a physiological perspective, their slightly longer than average sleep duration and a resting heart rate suggestive of good cardiovascular health are favorable indicators. While there is some variability in sleep duration and start time, these do not appear to be extreme enough to definitively place them in the poorer sleep quality category based on the available data. The positive correlations with PSQI score for some beneficial factors (e.g., Self-Esteem, Happy, Health Satisfaction, which are higher in this participant) and negative correlations for less beneficial factors (e.g., Stress, which is moderate in this participant) further support a more favorable sleep quality.

The absence of significant red flags in their behavioral and physiological metrics, combined with self-reported psychological well-being, points towards a PSQI score that likely falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.14) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.33), aligning with classifications of ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Self-esteem is within a favorable range, indicated by a Z-score of -0.17 relative to the study population. Subjective happiness is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55), and perceived stress levels are notably lower than the population mean (Z-score of -0.71). Trust of others is also slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.5). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is strong, with a 3.75 for Fall 2015.

Lifestyle behaviors reveal a consistent pattern of limited engagement in substance use, with no reported use of beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are mixed; while participation in sports is relatively high (Z-score of 0.91), exercising alone or with others occurs with low frequency. Daily recreation primarily involves moderate amounts of internet usage, watching TV/videos/movies, and listening to music, with less time spent on video games or socializing. Reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are less frequent. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.12).

Physiological data from the wearable device indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.16), while intradaily variability is close to the population mean (Z-score of 0.1). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is somewhat elevated (Z-score of 0.48), suggesting some consistency in daily heart rate patterns. The mesor (average heart rate over a 24-hour period) is notably low (Z-score of -1.27), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also below average (Z-score of -0.6), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 4:57 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score of -0.85). The aggregated hourly deviation from the mesor indicates a pattern of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM show the largest negative deviations) and higher heart rate in the afternoon and early evening, with the most pronounced positive deviation observed between 2-3 PM (Z-score of 1.22). This pattern is consistent with typical diurnal physiological rhythms.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 1 minute, which is close to the population average (Z-score of -0.21). The variability in sleep duration is also near the population mean (Z-score of -0.15). The median sleep start time is approximately 12:50 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score of -0.7), suggesting some variability but not extreme inconsistency. There are no reported daily naps, which is significantly below the population average (Z-score of -0.86).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers insights into various factors that may influence sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI. On the positive side, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are often associated with better sleep. Their self-esteem and perceived happiness are also within a reasonable range, and they experience lower-than-average stress. Academic performance is strong. Lifestyle habits are generally healthy, with no substance use and a moderate level of physical activity, particularly in sports. Physiological data shows a relatively stable circadian rhythm, and the median sleep duration is within the recommended range.

However, there are a few factors that might contribute to a less optimal PSQI score. While sleep duration is adequate, the median sleep start time of nearly 1 AM, coupled with a notable standard deviation in sleep start times, could indicate some irregularity in sleep scheduling. The absence of daily naps might also contribute to a higher PSQI score if naps are used to compensate for daytime sleepiness. The moderate engagement in some recreational activities and lower-than-average health satisfaction could indirectly impact sleep.

The population PSQI has a mean of 6.72 and a 50th percentile of 6.0. Given the participant's generally low stress, low anxiety and depression, and adequate sleep duration, it is plausible they fall within the bottom 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While the sleep start time variability could be a minor detractor, the absence of significant psychological distress and the presence of healthy lifestyle habits lean towards a better overall sleep profile.

The participant exhibits a moderate level of psychological distress, with a CES-D score of 13, indicating no significant depressive symptoms, and an STAI-Trait score of 43, which suggests a tendency towards anxiety proneness within the ""anxious"" classification. Self-esteem appears to be high, with a score of 40, at the upper limit of the scale, correlating negatively with PSQI. Trust levels are above average (Z-score of 0.83), and self-reported happiness is also above average (Z-score of 0.55), both correlating negatively with PSQI. Stress levels are slightly below average (Z-score of -0.17), with a positive correlation to PSQI. The participant's BMI is within the healthy range (20.0) and self-reported health satisfaction is above average (Z-score of 0.22), correlating negatively with PSQI.

Behaviorally, the participant reports frequent alcohol consumption (beer three times a week or more, wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), but infrequent use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits indicate moderate engagement in solitary exercise (1-2 times a week) and higher engagement in exercising with others and sports (three times a week or more, and 1-2 times a week respectively). Daily recreational habits show substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours) and playing video games (31 minutes an hour), while internet usage, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies occupy less time. Notably, time spent socializing with friends is moderate (1-2 hours). Correlations with PSQI for these behavioral metrics are generally low, with some minor positive correlations observed for screen-based entertainment (Watching TV/Videos/Movies, Video Games) and stress.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as suggested by the interdaily stability (0.46, Z-score 0.42) and intradaily variability (0.5, Z-score -0.32). The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score -0.55). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the evening at 7:39 PM. Resting heart rate is low (52.0 bpm, Z-score -0.73), indicating good cardiovascular fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a distinct diurnal pattern. There is a significant increase in heart rate deviations during the evening hours (7-8 PM and 8-9 PM show Z-scores of 2.12 and 0.68 respectively), suggesting increased physiological arousal during this period. Conversely, there is a pronounced dip in heart rate deviations during the early morning hours (particularly 7-8 AM, with a Z-score of -1.14), consistent with the body's natural suppression of activity during sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes, which is below average for the study population (Z-score -1.25). The standard deviation of sleep duration is within the average range, suggesting relative consistency in sleep duration from night to night. The median sleep start time is exceptionally late (04:31:59), with a moderate standard deviation. Mean daily naps are absent. Correlations with PSQI indicate a slight positive association with increased sleep duration variability and mean daily naps.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents several indicators that may influence their PSQI score, reflecting both positive and potentially negative aspects of their sleep quality. On the positive side, the participant reports high self-esteem, high happiness, and high trust, all of which correlate negatively with PSQI, suggesting they may contribute to better sleep quality. Their resting heart rate is also low, indicating good physical health, and their health satisfaction is above average, again correlating negatively with PSQI. The circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability and intradaily variability, suggest a degree of regularity in their physiological rhythms, which is generally conducive to good sleep.

However, several factors suggest a potentially poorer sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes is significantly below the population average (Z-score -1.25), and shorter sleep durations are typically associated with higher PSQI scores. The very late median sleep start time (04:31:59) further suggests a significant disruption to conventional sleep schedules, which often leads to impaired sleep quality. While the correlations are not strongly indicative, the moderate positive correlation between stress and PSQI, and the slight positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSQI, suggest these factors could be contributing to a higher PSQI score. Additionally, the high engagement in sedentary leisure activities like watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, coupled with moderate alcohol consumption, may indirectly affect sleep quality. The notable elevation in heart rate deviations during the evening hours, peaking around 7-8 PM, could also be indicative of pre-sleep arousal that may interfere with sleep onset or maintenance.

Considering the population's PSQI distribution with a mean of 6.72 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, the participant's significantly short sleep duration and very late sleep onset are strong indicators of poorer sleep quality. While other psychological and physiological factors may be positive, the objective measures of sleep timing and duration appear to be the most critical in determining their position within the PSQI distribution. Given these factors, it is likely that the participant's PSQI score would fall in the upper half of the distribution, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

The participant reports moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 14.0, Z-score 0.07) and a tendency towards anxiety (STAI score of 45.0, Z-score 0.37), placing them in the upper range of the population for these measures. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 34.0, Z-score -0.59), while happiness is moderately above average (score of 4.0, Z-score 0.55). Trust levels are below the population mean (score of 2.83, Z-score -0.78), and perceived stress is slightly below average (score of 20.0, Z-score -0.44). Health satisfaction is also somewhat lower than the population mean (score of 3.56, Z-score -0.53). Academic performance appears mixed, with a decline in Fall 2016 GPA (3.1) compared to previous semesters.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports no substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs), with significantly low Z-scores for Beer and Wine/Liquor usage. Exercise frequency is low, with minimal engagement in exercising alone (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.43) and no reported exercise with others or participation in sports. Daily recreational activities include moderate engagement in video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.96) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18), with less time spent listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.72) and socializing with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41). Sedentary hobbies occupy 1-2 hours daily (Z-score 1.41), and reading is limited to 15 minutes or less (Z-score 0.32).

Wearable data reveals a circadian rhythm with a Mesor of 74.34 (Z-score 0.05) and an amplitude of 12.42 (Z-score 0.53), suggesting a moderately pronounced daily variation. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 4:54 PM. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.45, Z-score 0.33), indicating a degree of regularity in the daily rhythm, while intradaily variability is notably higher than the population average (0.64, Z-score 0.67), suggesting more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also slightly above average (0.35, Z-score 0.22), further supporting some daily regularity. The resting heart rate is below the population mean at 54.2 (Z-score -0.47). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -25.99 at 5-6 am, Z-score -1.11), with a pronounced elevation in the evening hours (e.g., 22.05 at 6-7 pm, Z-score 1.65).

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 3 minutes, which is considerably shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.41). The variability in sleep duration is also elevated, with a standard deviation of 133 minutes (Z-score 0.74). The median sleep start time is late, at 01:47:16, with high variability around this time (standard deviation of 135 minutes, Z-score 1.14). The average daily naps are minimal (0.07, Z-score -0.08).

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data presents several indicators that may contribute to a poorer sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI. Notably, the median sleep duration is significantly short (6 hours 3 minutes) and exhibits high variability, both suggesting disruption. The late and highly variable sleep start time further points to an irregular sleep schedule. While the correlation between median sleep duration and PSQI score is relatively low (0.05), the magnitude of the deviation from the population mean strongly suggests a negative impact on sleep quality. The elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.67) could reflect increased physiological arousal or stress throughout the day and night, which is often associated with poorer sleep. Moderate anxiety levels (STAI Z-score 0.37) can also directly impair sleep quality. The positive correlation between STAI and PSQI score (0.4) further supports this.

Conversely, several factors do not strongly suggest a significantly poor PSQI score. The participant reports no substance usage, which is generally beneficial for sleep. Their academic performance, while showing a dip, is generally high. They also report above-average happiness and below-average stress levels. The interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm is slightly above average, indicating some regularity. The resting heart rate is also below population average.

Considering the strong evidence for significantly shortened and irregular sleep duration, coupled with a late and variable sleep onset, and the contributing factor of moderate anxiety, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score falls in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality relative to the study population. The population's median PSQI score is 6.0, with the 75th percentile at 8.0. Given the observed sleep duration and variability, it is plausible this participant exceeds the median and potentially the 75th percentile.

The participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile, characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.76) and anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.22). This aligns with high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = 1.52) and a significant degree of trust in others (Trust Z-score = 1.79), coupled with high self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score = 1.64). Their reported stress levels are slightly below the population average (Stress Z-score = -0.17). This overall positive psychological state is further supported by a high satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score = 1.63). In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports infrequent substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor less than 1-2 times a month, and not using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits indicate a balance between individual exercise (1-2 times a week) and exercising with others (three times a week or more), although they do not participate in organized sports. Daily recreational activities are relatively limited; they spend minimal time watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or using the internet, and even less time listening to music or socializing with friends. They do not engage in reading or other sedentary hobbies.

The participant's wearable data reveals a robust and well-structured circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of their heart rate is notably high (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 1.41), suggesting consistent daily patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is very low (Intradaily Variability Z-score = -2.08), indicating a stable and less fluctuating heart rate throughout the day and night. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also strong (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score = 1.4), further confirming the regularity of their circadian cycle. The Mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is close to the population mean (Mesor Z-score = 0.05). However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly elevated (Amplitude Z-score = 2.26), suggesting a larger range between peak and trough heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at approximately 3:42 PM. Their resting heart rate is below the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.61). An examination of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals distinct diurnal patterns. Heart rates are consistently below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, reaching their lowest deviations between 2-5 AM. Deviations become positive and increasingly pronounced from approximately 8 AM onwards, peaking significantly in the afternoon between 3-5 PM, before gradually declining into the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = 1.1), with a standard deviation that is close to the population average, suggesting consistency in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late, around 00:16, and the standard deviation of sleep start times is slightly above average, indicating some variability in bedtime. Notably, the participant reports no daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = -0.86). The sleep statistics do not show a strong correlation with the PSQI score.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding potential PSQI score placement. On one hand, their positive psychological profile, characterized by low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, trust, and happiness, as well as high health satisfaction, suggests a predisposition towards better sleep quality. Their lifestyle, with infrequent substance use and a balanced exercise routine, also does not indicate major behavioral impediments to sleep. Their wearable data shows a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm, which is generally indicative of good sleep hygiene. Furthermore, their sleep duration is longer than average and relatively consistent.

However, several factors could contribute to a less favorable PSQI score. The late median sleep start time (00:16) and some variability in sleep start times could point towards sleep timing issues. The significant elevation in the amplitude of their heart rate circadian rhythm, while indicative of a strong rhythm, might suggest higher physiological arousal during their active phase, which could potentially impact sleep onset or quality. While correlations between specific metrics and the PSQI score are provided, many of these are weak or do not clearly point towards a high PSQI. For instance, higher self-esteem and trust are correlated negatively with PSQI, suggesting better sleep. Conversely, stress is positively correlated, which is consistent with the data but at a near-average level. The positive correlation between CES-D and STAI scores with PSQI suggests that increased depressive and anxious symptoms would be associated with poorer sleep quality, which is not observed in this participant's profile.

Considering the population PSQI statistics (Mean: 6.73, 75th percentile: 8.0), the participant's generally positive psychological state, regular circadian rhythm, and longer sleep duration lean towards better sleep quality. While there are some indicators of potential sleep timing variability, they do not appear to be substantial enough to outweigh the evidence for good sleep health across other domains. Therefore, it is plausible that this participant's PSQI score would fall in the lower half of the distribution, indicating average to good sleep quality.

This participant presents with a generally lower-than-average level of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 8.0, Z-score -0.55) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 29.0, Z-score -1.22), suggesting a relatively stable psychological disposition. Self-esteem is reported at a score of 45.0, which, though higher than the typical range for the scale (10-40), has a positive Z-score of 0.96, indicating it is above average in the study population. Self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.53). Stress levels are reported at 20.0 (Z-score -0.44), which is below the population average, aligning with lower anxiety and depressive symptom scores. Trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score 0.18), and health satisfaction is below average (Z-score -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (beer three times a week or more, Z-score 1.72; wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94), which is significantly above the population average for beer consumption. Recreational drug use is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-score -0.31), and non-prescribed drug use is also absent. Physical activity is relatively consistent, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week alone (Z-score 0.32) and with others (Z-score 0.53), and participation in sports 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.25), which are generally in line with population averages. Daily recreation involves considerable time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13) and moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18). Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours (Z-score 0.16). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a resting heart rate of 54.1 bpm (Z-score -0.48), which is below average. The mesor of their heart rate rhythm is 71.41 bpm (Z-score -0.35), also below average. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 7.19 bpm (Z-score -1.16), indicating a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate compared to the population. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is reported at 6:09 PM. Critically, the circadian rhythm metrics reveal low interdaily stability (Value 0.17, Z-score -1.98) and low intradaily variability (Value 0.29, Z-score -1.8), suggesting a highly irregular and unstructured daily pattern in heart rate. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value 0.17, Z-score -1.29). The hourly deviation from the mesor indicates a significant dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM with a deviation of -10.51, Z-score 0.92, and 4-5 AM with -13.75, Z-score 0.72). Heart rate increases noticeably in the evening, peaking between 7-8 PM (deviation 13.29, Z-score 0.31).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 39 minutes (Z-score -0.66), which is below average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 97 minutes (Z-score -0.08), suggesting some variability. The median sleep start time is 02:10:59 AM, which is substantially later than average (indicated by a large negative deviation from the mesor in early morning hours and significant deviations later in the day). The standard deviation of sleep start time is 88 minutes (Z-score 0.12), indicating moderate consistency in bedtime. The participant also averages 0.25 daily naps (Z-score 2.07), which is significantly above the population average, suggesting a potential need for daytime sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality, necessitating a holistic evaluation. On the positive side, the participant exhibits low levels of reported depressive symptoms and anxiety, along with above-average self-esteem. However, their health satisfaction is below average, and they engage in higher-than-average alcohol consumption, particularly beer.

The most significant indicators of potentially poor sleep quality stem from the wearable data. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 39 minutes is below the population average. More critically, the sleep start time of approximately 2:11 AM, combined with a high average of 0.25 daily naps, suggests significant sleep timing issues and possible sleep deprivation or fragmented sleep. The low interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate further point towards a disrupted circadian rhythm, which is intrinsically linked to sleep regulation. The pronounced heart rate dips in the early morning hours and subsequent evening increases, coupled with a late acrophase, reinforce the notion of a misaligned circadian phase.

While correlations with the PSQI score are provided as guidance, it is crucial to interpret these in the context of the overall data. The positive correlation of stress with PSQI (0.2) is not highly concerning given the participant's below-average stress scores. The negative correlation of self-esteem with PSQI (-0.35) and trust (-0.21) are also not strong drivers for poor sleep quality given the participant's scores on these measures. Conversely, the positive correlation of mean daily naps with PSQI (0.17) aligns with the observed high nap frequency.

Considering the combination of insufficient sleep duration, a very late sleep onset, a high frequency of naps, and objective evidence of circadian rhythm dysregulation, it is likely that this participant experiences poor sleep quality that would place them in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution for PSQI scores.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by relatively low levels of self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.24), moderate anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score = -0.03), and slightly below average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -0.31). Happiness levels are also reported as below average (Happy Z-score = -0.53). Notably, the participant reports higher than average stress levels (Stress Z-score = 0.65), which could be a contributing factor to some of the observed sleep patterns. Their perceived health satisfaction is significantly above the population average (Health Satisfaction Z-score = 1.3), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being despite higher stress.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports moderate weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94), while abstaining from beer and recreational drugs. Exercise is a prominent behavior, with a high frequency of exercising alone (Frequency = 'Three times a week or more', Z-score = 1.07), but no reported instances of exercising with others. Daily sedentary activities include moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.85). Notably, dedicated time for reading, video games, and other sedentary hobbies is reported as ""Do not do."" Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score = 0.16), indicating a moderate social engagement.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal several insights into the participant's circadian rhythm and heart rate patterns. The mesor (average heart rate across the 24-hour cycle) is notably low relative to the population (Mesor Z-score = -1.54), with a low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -1.04), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The circadian rhythm exhibits lower than average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score = -0.49) and near average intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score = -0.04), indicating some irregularity in daily patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is significantly low (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score = -1.45), further supporting a less robust daily rhythm. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is reported as 5:17 PM. Analysis of the hourly deviation from the mesor highlights a pronounced increase in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and early evening hours, peaking between 4-5 PM (24.58) and 5-6 PM (23.91), which aligns with the reported acrophase. Conversely, heart rates are consistently below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, with the most significant negative deviations observed between 3-4 AM (-16.4) and 4-5 AM (-16.43), suggesting a period of significant physiological quiescence.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.48). The variability in sleep duration is also slightly above average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score = 0.39). The median sleep start time is notably late, at 02:28:00 AM, with a corresponding high standard deviation in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = 0.41), suggesting considerable variability in bedtime. The participant reports a very low frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = -0.02).

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The provided data offers several indicators that suggest the participant may have a PSQI score within the lower half of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The participant's psychological profile shows generally moderate to low levels of distress, with a CES-D score indicating no significant depressive symptoms, a near-average anxiety score, and slightly below-average self-esteem. While stress levels are reported as higher than average, this is contrasted with a significantly high satisfaction with their physical health.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular solitary exercise and has moderate social engagement. The reported sedentary activities, while present, do not appear to be excessively dominating their daily routine, with the exception of internet usage.

Physiologically, the lower mesor and resting heart rate, along with a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours, suggest a baseline of physiological regulation that could support adequate sleep. While the interdaily stability of their circadian rhythm is slightly below average, this does not necessarily translate to poor sleep quality, and the intradaily variability is within the average range.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes, which, while slightly below average, is not indicative of severe sleep deprivation. The most significant concern regarding sleep quality is the late median sleep start time of 02:28:00 AM and the substantial variability in sleep start times. A late and inconsistent bedtime can often contribute to poorer sleep quality. However, the sleep duration standard deviation is only marginally above average, suggesting that despite the variability in *when* they sleep, the *duration* might be more consistent once they do sleep. The low frequency of naps is also a positive indicator.

Considering the population PSQI distribution with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, a lower PSQI score (indicating better sleep quality) would fall at or below 6.0. While we do not have the participant's actual PSQI score, the confluence of several factors leans towards a potentially better sleep quality. The absence of significant depressive symptoms, high health satisfaction, regular exercise, and a resting heart rate suggesting good cardiovascular health are all protective factors for sleep. The primary detractor is the late and variable sleep onset. However, the moderate sleep duration and low nap frequency, coupled with the general psychological and physiological indicators, suggest that the participant might not experience the significant sleep disturbances typically associated with the top 50% of the PSQI distribution. Without direct PSQI scores, this assessment is inferential, but the evidence suggests a profile more aligned with the bottom half.

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral traits, with several indicators suggesting potential areas of concern related to stress, anxiety, and sleep. Subjective well-being is moderately impacted, as evidenced by a relatively neutral CES-D score (indicating not depressed) but a slightly elevated STAI score, suggesting proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem appears to be in the lower range for the study population, while current self-reported happiness is also below average. Stress levels are moderately elevated, correlating positively with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also below average.

Lifestyle behaviors reveal a moderate intake of alcohol, specifically wine or liquor on a weekly basis, which is higher than the population average. Physical activity is relatively low, with exercise occurring only once or twice a week, and sports participation being absent. Sedentary behaviors are prominent, particularly in terms of watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, both exceeding population averages in daily time spent.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates significant variability in heart rate throughout the day, as suggested by a high Intradaily Variability score. This, combined with a low Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours, points to a less structured and potentially disrupted circadian rhythm. The mesor of the heart rate is elevated compared to the population average, and the amplitude is notably lower, suggesting a dampened daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase occurring in the late afternoon (4:54 PM) is consistent with a later chronotype, which may contribute to difficulties in adhering to a typical sleep schedule. The average deviation from the mesor shows pronounced dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (3-6 AM), potentially reflecting periods of deep sleep or physiological recovery, but these occur during times when waking is typically expected for many.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours, which is slightly below the population average. More notably, the median sleep start time is very late (1:49 AM), coupled with a substantial standard deviation in sleep start times, indicating significant sleep schedule irregularity. The participant also reports a moderate frequency of napping. While sleep duration and start time do not exhibit strong correlations with the PSQI score, the overall pattern of physiological dysregulation and irregular sleep timing, alongside elevated stress and anxiety, suggests a potential for poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture with respect to sleep quality, requiring a holistic assessment. On the one hand, subjective measures of depression are not elevated, and self-esteem, while below average, does not indicate severe impairment. Alcohol consumption, particularly wine or liquor, is higher than average, which can negatively impact sleep quality. More significantly, the wearable data points to a disrupted circadian rhythm, characterized by low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability in heart rate. The late median sleep start time and significant variability in sleep onset further suggest a disordered sleep schedule, which is a key component of poor sleep quality. Elevated stress and anxiety levels are also known contributors to sleep disturbances. The moderate frequency of napping, alongside the short median sleep duration, may indicate attempts to compensate for poor nocturnal sleep.

While there is no direct measure of the participant's PSQI score, the constellation of factors—particularly the physiological indicators of circadian disruption, the irregular sleep schedule, and the psychological variables of stress and anxiety—strongly suggest a higher likelihood of experiencing poor sleep quality. These factors are commonly associated with elevated PSQI scores, indicating sleep disturbances. Given the population parameters where the 75th percentile for PSQI is 8.0, the observed pattern leans towards the upper half of the distribution, signifying poorer sleep quality.

The participant exhibits a range of psychological and behavioral characteristics that likely influence their sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological state, with a CES-D score of 5.0 suggesting no significant depressive symptoms and an STAI-Trait score of 35.0 indicating low chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is relatively high, as evidenced by a score of 44.0 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, coupled with above-average reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and trust in others (Z-score 2.75). However, the participant reports elevated stress levels (Z-score 1.74). Their academic performance, reflected in GPA scores ranging from 3.63 to 3.95, is strong. Substance usage is notably absent, with no reported use of beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a month alone or with others, but sports are engaged in 1-2 times a week, suggesting some structured physical engagement. Daily recreational habits are predominantly sedentary, with limited time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and listening to music. Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported as approximately 31 minutes per hour, while reading and other sedentary hobbies are limited to 15 minutes or less.

Wearable data provides insights into physiological patterns and sleep regularity. The mesor of the heart rate is 72.97 bpm, which is slightly below average for the population (Z-score -0.13), and the amplitude is 10.62 bpm, also slightly below average (Z-score -0.05). The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs around 4:37 PM, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern of physiological activity. Interdaily stability of the heart rate is 0.43 (Z-score 0.17), indicating a moderate degree of day-to-day regularity in circadian rhythms, while intraday variability is 0.73 (Z-score 1.3), suggesting higher than average within-day fluctuations. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.22, Z-score -0.87), further supporting less consistent daily patterning. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a notable pattern: a significant decrease in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM with -7.49 deviation, 3-4 AM with -15.69, 4-5 AM with -20.56, 5-6 AM with -21.45, 6-7 AM with -21.42). This is followed by a substantial increase in heart rate deviation starting from the late morning and extending through the afternoon, peaking between 3-4 PM (17.84 deviation, Z-score 1.61). This pattern suggests a tendency for the heart rate to drop significantly during typical sleep hours and to increase markedly during daylight hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.76). The variability in sleep duration is high, as indicated by a standard deviation of 172 minutes (Z-score 1.62). The median sleep start time is late, around 2:54 AM, with moderate variability (106 minutes standard deviation, Z-score 0.51). The participant also engages in napping, with a mean of 0.2 naps per day (Z-score 1.49), suggesting potential sleep fragmentation or a strategy to compensate for insufficient nocturnal sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators relevant to assessing the participant's PSQI score relative to the study population. The population's PSQI mean is 6.73, with a 50th percentile of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score below 6.0 generally indicates good sleep quality, while scores of 6.0 or higher suggest potential sleep problems.

Evidence suggesting a **low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile)** includes the participant's generally positive psychological profile. They report low levels of depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness, which are typically associated with better sleep quality. Their strong academic performance, despite elevated stress, may also suggest a certain level of functioning that is not severely hampered by sleep issues. Furthermore, the absence of substance use and a moderate level of structured physical activity (sports) could contribute to better sleep hygiene.

However, there are significant indicators pointing towards a **high PSQI score (top 50th percentile)**, suggesting poorer sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes is notably shorter than optimal, and the high standard deviation in sleep duration (172 minutes, Z-score 1.62) points to significant inconsistency. The late median sleep start time of approximately 2:54 AM, coupled with a moderate standard deviation, suggests a delayed sleep phase or irregular sleep schedule. The presence of daily naps (mean of 0.2, Z-score 1.49) often serves as a compensatory behavior for insufficient or poor-quality nighttime sleep. The aggregated hourly heart rate data, showing significantly reduced heart rate deviation during typical sleep hours and elevated deviation during the afternoon, further supports a disrupted circadian rhythm and potentially inefficient sleep. While the correlation data does not directly provide a PSQI score, the positive correlation of sleep duration standard deviation (0.21) and mean daily naps (0.18) with PSQI are indicative of potential poorer sleep. The higher intraday variability (Z-score 1.3) in heart rate also aligns with less structured physiological rhythms, which can negatively impact sleep. The elevated stress levels, despite other positive psychological indicators, could also contribute to sleep difficulties.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the participant presents with many positive psychological attributes, the objective sleep metrics from the wearable device are strongly indicative of sleep disturbances. The significantly shortened and highly variable sleep duration, the late and inconsistent sleep start time, and the presence of naps collectively suggest that the participant experiences poor sleep quality. These objective findings, coupled with the potential for elevated stress to disrupt sleep, outweigh the more positive self-reported psychological measures in determining overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the top 50th percentile of the study population, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

28724,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a profile characterized by moderate psychological distress, specific behavioral patterns, and a generally regular, albeit slightly elevated, physiological rhythm. Self-reported measures indicate a low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and near-average levels of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.13). Self-esteem is also within the typical range for the population (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score: 0.11). Notably, the participant reports high levels of current happiness (Z-score: 1.64), which appears to be incongruent with the reported moderate levels of stress (Z-score: -0.44). Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.2).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, reporting wine or liquor usage 1-2 times per week (Z-score: 0.94), while abstaining from beer and recreational drugs. Physical activity levels are noteworthy, with frequent solo exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07) but infrequent exercise with others and no participation in sports. Daily recreational habits are dominated by sedentary activities, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64) and listening to music (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.21), alongside moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.18) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16). Reading and sedentary hobbies occupy less time.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a consistent circadian rhythm characterized by moderate stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.74) and higher variability within the day (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.51). The Mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is slightly below average (Mesor Z-score: -0.45), and the Amplitude, indicating the extent of daily variation, is also below average (Amplitude Z-score: -0.57). The Acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported as 3:31 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the population mean (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.2). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, there are substantial positive deviations during the late morning and early afternoon, specifically between 8-9 AM (Z-score: 0.94), 9-10 AM (Z-score: 1.07), 10-11 AM (Z-score: 0.61), 11 AM-12 PM (Z-score: 1.71), and 1-2 PM (Z-score: 2.1). Conversely, the late night and early morning hours (from 12 AM to 6 AM) show consistent negative deviations from the Mesor, indicating lower physiological activity during this period.

Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score: 0.79), with relatively low variability in nightly sleep durations (Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.81). The median sleep start time is late, just before midnight (23:58:59), with a low standard deviation in sleep start times (28 minutes, Z-score: -1.22), suggesting consistent sleep timing. The frequency of daily naps is minimal (Z-score: -0.02).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's overall sleep quality relative to the study population, we will consider the provided PSQI population statistics and examine the correlations between various metrics and the PSQI score. The population PSQI mean is 6.73, with a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. This indicates that a PSQI score above 6.0 would place an individual in the top 50% of the distribution, suggesting poorer sleep quality.

Several factors suggest the participant may have a PSQI score in the bottom 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Their median sleep duration is substantial at 7 hours and 49 minutes, and the variability in sleep duration is low, both of which are generally associated with better sleep quality. The low standard deviation in sleep start times also points to consistent sleep patterns. Furthermore, the participant reports not being depressed (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and has relatively low chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.13), and their self-esteem is within the average range. While the participant reports high current happiness (Z-score: 1.64), and a correlation exists between happiness and PSQI (Score Correlation: -0.27), this strong positive self-report does not necessarily translate to poor sleep quality, and the correlation itself is not exceptionally strong.

Conversely, some factors might suggest a higher PSQI score, placing them in the top 50%. The significant deviations in hourly heart rate during the late morning and early afternoon, particularly the peak at 1-2 PM (Z-score: 2.1), could indicate physiological dysregulation that may be indirectly linked to sleep disturbances. The high intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 1.51) also suggests a less stable physiological rhythm, which can impact sleep. The moderate wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94) is a behavioral factor that can negatively influence sleep quality. The correlation between stress and PSQI (Score Correlation: 0.2) is positive, suggesting higher stress may be associated with poorer sleep, although the participant's stress score itself is not markedly high.

However, the most direct indicators of sleep quality available in the data are the sleep statistics. The substantial median sleep duration, low variability in sleep duration, and consistent sleep timing are strong indicators of good sleep. While some physiological and behavioral elements might suggest areas for improvement, they do not strongly contraindicate good sleep quality in the absence of direct PSQI domain scores. Given the robust sleep duration and consistency metrics, and the absence of significant self-reported sleep complaints (which are not directly provided but implied by the general survey data), it is more likely that this participant falls into the bottom 50% of the PSQI distribution. The positive correlations of sleep duration (0.05) and sleep duration standard deviation (-0.2) with PSQI, while not strongly negative, further support this.

69831,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological patterns that likely influence their sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally lower-than-average level of stress (Z-score = -1.53), coupled with slightly below average happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.2). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and exercises infrequently, with no reported solitary exercise or sports participation, although they do engage in sports 1-2 times a week. Their alcohol consumption, including beer and wine/liquor, falls into the 1-2 times a week category, which is above the population average (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively).

Daily activities are characterized by substantial engagement in screen-based behaviors and social interactions. The participant reports spending 2-3 hours watching TV/videos/movies, 3-4 hours on the internet, and more than 4 hours listening to music. Socializing with friends also occupies a significant portion of their day, exceeding 4 hours. Reading and playing video games are not regular activities for this individual. These patterns, particularly high internet and music listening times, correlate moderately with poorer sleep quality, as indicated by the positive score correlations.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate data reveals a resting heart rate of 56.0 bpm, which is below the population average (Z-score = -0.26). The cosinor analysis of their heart rate suggests a mesor of 71.67 bpm (Z-score = -0.31) and an amplitude of 11.4 bpm (Z-score = 0.2), with the acrophase occurring in the late afternoon (4:43 PM). The interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Value = 0.38, Z-score = -0.24), while intradaily variability is also lower than the population average (Value = 0.44, Z-score = -0.74). This suggests a somewhat less consistent daily rhythm in heart rate. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveal characteristic dips during the early morning hours (e.g., -22.31 at 4-5 AM), followed by a gradual increase throughout the day, peaking in the late evening (e.g., 18.13 at 7-8 PM). These diurnal variations are within expected physiological ranges.

Regarding sleep statistics, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours, which is above the population average (Z-score = 1.01), and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (Value = 104 minutes, Z-score = 0.07), suggesting consistent sleep length. However, their median sleep start time is notably late, at 1:34 AM, with a standard deviation of 35 minutes. This late sleep onset, coupled with the above-average duration, indicates a potential for disrupted circadian timing and may contribute to difficulties in achieving restorative sleep, despite the longer sleep duration. No daily naps were reported (Z-score = -0.86).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators for evaluating the participant's overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On the positive side, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours, which is above the population average, and a low standard deviation in sleep duration, suggesting consistency in sleep length. Their resting heart rate is also below average, and their stress levels are considerably lower than the population average. Furthermore, they report generally not being anxious and having a moderate level of self-esteem.

However, several factors suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality. The median sleep start time of 1:34 AM is significantly later than average, indicating a likely shift in their circadian timing. The correlation analysis also highlights a positive association between extended durations of internet usage, listening to music, and watching TV/videos/movies with poorer PSQI scores. These behaviors are prominent in the participant's daily routine. While the participant reports lower than average happiness and health satisfaction, and higher than average substance usage, the direct correlations with PSQI are not strongly indicative of a major impact on sleep quality from these specific factors in this dataset. The interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm is also slightly below average, suggesting some irregularity in their daily physiological patterns.

Considering the balance of evidence, the late sleep onset time and the significant time spent on screen-based and audio-visual activities, which correlate with poorer sleep quality, are strong indicators that the participant may experience difficulties with their sleep. While the absolute sleep duration is adequate, the timing and behavioral patterns suggest a potential for a PSQI score that falls within the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality relative to the study population. The consistent nature of their sleep duration might mitigate some of the negative effects, but the late sleep start time and high engagement in potentially disruptive activities are more concerning for sleep quality.

44927,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"This participant presents a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that inform their sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.76) and moderate levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.13), with relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -0.87). They also report above-average trust in others (Trust Z-score = 1.15) and below-average happiness (Happy Z-score = -0.53). Their perceived stress levels are near the population mean (Stress Z-score = 0.1). Behavioral data indicate a complete absence of substance use, including beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is low for solitary activities and absent for group activities, yet they report engaging in sports three times a week or more, which is a significant outlier (Sports Z-score = 1.58). Daily recreation habits include moderate internet and music listening, with limited time spent socializing, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Notably, they report not engaging in watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games.

Physiologically, as measured by the Fitbit, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (RHR Z-score = -0.42) and a lower than average Mesor (Z-score = -0.33) and Amplitude (Z-score = -0.39) in their circadian rhythm of heart rate. The Acrophase of the heart rate rhythm is around 3:34 PM. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity, Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -0.16) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -0.18), are close to the population mean, suggesting a moderately structured circadian pattern. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the night and early morning hours, with significant negative deviations from the Mesor, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 1-2 AM Z-score = -0.86, 3-4 AM Z-score = -0.30, 4-5 AM Z-score = -0.63). Conversely, heart rate tends to be higher than average in the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 7-8 AM Z-score = 1.9, 9-10 AM Z-score = 0.91, 2-3 PM Z-score = 0.67). This pattern suggests a potential discrepancy between physiological wakefulness signals and actual sleep patterns, with pronounced physiological lows during typical sleep times.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average (Duration Z-score = -0.77). The variability in sleep duration is also lower than average (SD Z-score = -0.79), suggesting a more consistent sleep duration from night to night. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:59:30), with a moderate standard deviation, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The participant also engages in very infrequent napping, with a mean of 0.07 daily naps. The overall correlation coefficients provided suggest a modest positive correlation between PSQI score and CES-D (0.49), STAI (0.40), and Stress (0.20), indicating that higher levels of these psychological factors may be associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, and health satisfaction show weak negative correlations with PSQI, suggesting a potential protective effect on sleep quality.

Considering the provided data, several indicators point towards a potential for suboptimal sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes is notably shorter than average, and the Z-score of -0.77 suggests it is within the lower half of the distribution for sleep duration. The significant physiological dips in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, coinciding with the sleep period, may reflect inefficient sleep or a mismatch between the body's natural rhythms and the implemented sleep schedule. While the participant reports not using substances and engaging in sports, their limited engagement in other physical activities and sedentary recreational habits do not strongly contribute to promoting good sleep hygiene. The positive correlations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress with PSQI suggest that if these psychological states were more pronounced, they would negatively impact sleep quality. However, their current levels are not extremely high. The low sleep duration, coupled with physiological patterns indicative of potential sleep inefficiency, suggests that the participant's sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is likely to fall in the less favorable half of the distribution.

71894,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress and altered physiological rhythms, which likely contribute to suboptimal sleep quality. Self-reported data reveal elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.15) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 2.24), positioning them in the upper echelons of the study population for these traits. Concurrently, self-esteem is markedly low (SelfEsteem Z-score = -2.7), and general happiness is also reduced (Happy Z-score = -1.61). Health satisfaction is also notably low (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -1.95). These psychological factors are associated with a positive correlation with the PSQI score, suggesting that higher distress and lower self-esteem are linked to poorer sleep quality. While stress levels are only marginally above the population mean (Stress Z-score = 0.1), the combination of high depression and anxiety scores with low self-esteem and happiness suggests a substantial psychological burden that could profoundly impact sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in high levels of internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score = 2.19) and listening to music (Listening to Music Z-score = 2.06), spending more than 4 hours daily on each. This is contrasted with minimal engagement in reading (Reading Z-score = 0.32) and recreational activities like watching TV/videos or playing video games. While physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring three times a week or more when alone (Exercised Alone Z-score = 1.07), and 1-2 times a week with others, sports participation is absent. Substance usage is minimal, with beer consumed less than once or twice a month and wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs not used at all. These behavioral patterns, particularly the high digital engagement, may displace or disrupt sleep-promoting activities. The correlations between these behavioral metrics and PSQI are generally weak, with internet and music listening showing a slight positive association, while exercise shows a slight negative association.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a somewhat irregular circadian rhythm, though with notable daily variations in heart rate. The mesor (mean heart rate around which daily oscillations occur) is slightly elevated (Mesor Z-score = 0.95) compared to the study population. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate, is observed around 2:33 PM. A significant finding is the pronounced deviation of hourly heart rates from the mesor, particularly during the early morning waking hours (6-7 AM, 7-8 AM), with substantially positive values indicating heightened physiological arousal during this period. Conversely, late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 1-4 AM) show significant negative deviations, suggesting periods of lower-than-average heart rate during these times. The intradaily variability is higher than average (Intradaily Variability Z-score = 0.81), indicating less smooth transitions in heart rate throughout the day. Interdaily stability, however, is close to the population average (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 0.5), suggesting some degree of regularity in daily rhythmicity. Resting heart rate is also above average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = 0.65). These physiological patterns, particularly the intense morning arousal and low nighttime heart rates, could reflect a dysregulated sleep-wake cycle. The correlations between most circadian metrics and PSQI are weak, with mesor and resting heart rate showing slight positive associations.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = -0.58), and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.56). However, the duration of sleep is also variable (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score = -1.06). The absence of napping is noted (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = -0.86). The median sleep duration and its variability, coupled with the observed psychological distress and physiological patterns, suggest that sleep quality is likely impacted. The weak but positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSQI further supports this.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant presents several indicators that suggest a likely PSQI score in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. The elevated CES-D and STAI scores, indicative of significant depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, are positively correlated with the PSQI score. Furthermore, low self-esteem and happiness levels, also negatively correlated with PSQI, contribute to the profile of psychological distress that is often associated with sleep disturbances. While the median sleep duration is only slightly below average, the variability in sleep duration, and the presence of marked psychological distress, are strong predictors of lower sleep quality. The physiological data, showing high variability in heart rate throughout the day and particularly pronounced arousal in the morning, could reflect an irregular circadian rhythm that disrupts consolidated sleep. These factors collectively point towards a sleep quality that is likely below average for the study population.

30453,16.0,1.0,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a complex psychological and behavioral profile that may influence sleep quality. Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 31.0, Z-score 1.84), moderate chronic anxiety (STAI score of 51.0, Z-score 0.96), and lower self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 27.0, Z-score -1.57). Happiness levels are also reported to be low (Z-score -1.61). Despite these indicators of potential distress, reported stress levels are only slightly above average (Stress score of 23.0, Z-score 0.38), and trust in others is below the population mean (Trust score of 2.67, Z-score -1.1). Health satisfaction is also somewhat lower than average (Score of 2.78, Z-score -1.11). Academically, the reported GPAs suggest consistent, though not exceptional, academic performance.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage of beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. They engage in moderate exercise, exercising alone 1-2 times a week and with others three times a week or more, and participate in sports three times a week or more. Daily recreational habits show a significant amount of time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and reading (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score 2.28), suggesting a preference for solitary and potentially calming activities. However, they also report 1-2 hours of internet usage and 1-2 hours of sedentary hobbies. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is minimal. Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes to an hour daily.

Wearable data reveals some notable physiological patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated compared to the population mean (Value 67.5, Z-score 1.11). Circadian rhythm analysis shows a Mesor (mean circadian rhythm level) that is higher than the population average (Value 80.18, Z-score 0.85), suggesting a generally higher baseline physiological arousal. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Value 8.82, Z-score -0.63), potentially indicating less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is around 3:51 PM. Measures of rhythm regularity indicate relatively low interdaily stability (Value 0.3, Z-score -0.9), suggesting inconsistent daily patterns, and moderate intradaily variability (Value 0.63, Z-score 0.6), indicating some fluctuation within days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value 0.27, Z-score -0.45), further supporting a lack of strong daily periodicity. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show a pattern of lower-than-average heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 am deviation of -13.21, Z-score -0.77; 3-4 am deviation of -13.27, Z-score 0.48), with a return to higher-than-average deviations during late morning and afternoon hours (e.g., 4-5 pm deviation of 12.18, Z-score 0.5).

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 25 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.96). The variability in sleep duration is higher than average (Value 145 minutes, Z-score 1.0). The median sleep start time is quite late, at 1:21 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (Value 95 minutes, Z-score 0.26), suggesting some variability in bedtime. There are no reported daily naps. The correlation between these specific sleep statistics and PSQI score do not indicate a strong direct relationship, with median sleep duration having a modest positive correlation (0.08), and sleep duration variability having a slightly stronger positive correlation (0.19).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant exhibits several factors that may contribute to a poorer sleep quality, thus placing them in the top 50% of the PSQI distribution. Notably, the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 25 minutes is below the population average, and the variability in sleep duration is high. These metrics are directly related to sleep quantity and consistency, key components of sleep quality. Furthermore, the elevated resting heart rate and higher Mesor from the circadian rhythm analysis, coupled with low interdaily stability, suggest a generally more aroused physiological state and a less structured daily rhythm, which can negatively impact sleep. The presence of significant depressive symptoms and moderate anxiety, along with lower self-esteem and happiness, are well-established psychological correlates of poor sleep quality. While the participant engages in regular exercise and has healthy substance use habits, the high engagement in listening to music and internet usage, especially when combined with sedentary hobbies, could potentially contribute to sleep difficulties if not managed effectively in the pre-sleep routine. The late median sleep start time also suggests a potential misalignment with typical diurnal schedules.

The correlations provided offer some directional insight but do not override the holistic interpretation. For instance, the positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSQI score (0.19) suggests that greater inconsistency in sleep duration is associated with worse sleep quality, which aligns with the participant's high sleep duration standard deviation. The negative correlation between self-esteem and PSQI (-0.35) indicates lower self-esteem is associated with poorer sleep quality. Although the correlation between CES-D score and PSQI (0.49) is the strongest positive correlation with PSQI, suggesting higher depressive symptoms are linked to worse sleep quality, the Z-score for CES-D is significantly elevated.

Considering the confluence of objective sleep duration metrics, physiological arousal indicators, and psychological distress, it is likely that this participant would have a PSQI score in the top 50% of the distribution, indicative of relatively poor sleep quality.

66047,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"This participant presents with a constellation of psychological and behavioral indicators suggestive of elevated distress and potentially suboptimal sleep. Self-reported measures indicate a high burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 3.4) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 3.13), both of which are significantly above the study population mean. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (SelfEsteem Z-score: -2.42), and current happiness is also below average (Happy Z-score: -1.61). While stress levels are moderately elevated (Stress Z-score: 0.65), the strong positive correlations between CES-D and STAI scores with the PSQI (0.49 and 0.39 respectively) suggest a significant link between these internal states and perceived sleep quality. Lifestyle factors, such as substantial daily screen time engaging in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 3.17) and internet usage (Z-score: 2.19), are considerably higher than the average participant, while physical activity, including exercising alone or with others, and participation in sports, are infrequent. The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) falls within the overweight category at 26.9. Health satisfaction is also reported as low (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -2.28).

Wearable data reveals a circadian rhythm characterized by a Mesor of 80.2 (Z-score: 0.85), suggesting a slightly elevated average heart rate compared to the population. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is reported at 6:35 PM. The hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicate a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (3-6 AM), with deviations reaching as low as -16.13 from the Mesor during the 6-7 AM hour. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviations during the late evening and early morning hours (12-1 AM, 1-2 AM), and again in the late afternoon/early evening (5-7 PM). The observed circadian metrics of Interdaily Stability (0.43, Z-score: 0.17) and Intradaily Variability (0.58, Z-score: 0.24) do not exhibit extreme deviations from the population means, suggesting a moderately structured daily rhythm. However, the significant elevations in CES-D and STAI scores, coupled with low self-esteem and happiness, and high screen time, are strongly associated with poorer sleep quality as indicated by their positive correlations with the PSQI. The participant's median sleep duration is 7 hours and 15 minutes, which is close to the population average, with a standard deviation of 106 minutes for sleep duration. The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:40:59, with a standard deviation of 84 minutes, indicating significant variability in sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is also elevated (0.28, Z-score: 2.4), suggesting potential daytime sleepiness or fragmented sleep patterns.

Given the substantial elevations in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and low self-esteem, along with significant engagement in high screen time activities and a late, variable sleep start time, it is highly probable that this participant experiences poor sleep quality. The positive correlations of psychological distress measures with the PSQI score are particularly salient indicators. While the median sleep duration itself is not critically low, the late sleep onset and its variability, coupled with frequent napping, are often indicative of disrupted sleep architecture. These factors, when considered holistically alongside the psychological distress, strongly suggest a PSQI score that falls within the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality relative to the study population.

79834,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex profile with several notable features impacting sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 8.0, Z-score of -0.55) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.43), suggesting a generally stable emotional state. Self-esteem is also within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.17). Notably, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score of -0.53), and trust in others is significantly lower than the population norm (Z-score of -1.42). Stress levels are also reported as relatively low (Z-score of -0.71). Despite these psychological indicators, the participant reports moderate satisfaction with their health (Health Satisfaction score of 5.0, Z-score of 0.55), which is slightly above average.

Behaviorally, substance use patterns reveal a divergence: no reported use of beer or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, yet frequent consumption of wine or liquor (three times a week or more, Z-score of 1.68). Physical activity is minimal, with infrequent engagement in exercising alone (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score of -1.18) and no reported exercise with others or participation in sports. Daily recreation primarily involves moderate engagement with television/videos (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 0.01) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.18), with less time dedicated to listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score of -0.72). Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours, which is near the population average (Z-score of 0.16). The participant does not engage in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a resting heart rate of 52.9 bpm (Z-score of -0.62), which is below the population mean. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is 69.8 bpm (Z-score of -0.57), also suggesting a lower baseline cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is relatively high at 12.5 bpm (Z-score of 0.56), indicating a notable variation between the highest and lowest points of the daily heart rate cycle. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is observed at 5:23 PM. Circadian rhythm stability metrics are mixed; Interdaily Stability is slightly below average (Value of 0.37, Z-score of -0.33), suggesting some irregularity in the daily rhythm, while Intradaily Variability is notably low (Value of 0.41, Z-score of -0.95), indicating less fluctuation within a 24-hour period. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is somewhat elevated (Value of 0.4, Z-score of 0.64), suggesting a degree of regularity in daily patterns.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. During typical sleep hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), heart rate deviations are consistently negative, ranging from -13.73 to -20.77 bpm, indicating a significant reduction in physiological arousal during these periods. The highest deviations occur in the late evening and early morning, with particularly high positive deviations observed between 9-10 PM (17.24 bpm, Z-score of 1.61) and 6-7 PM (20.36 bpm, Z-score of 1.36), suggesting periods of increased physiological activity leading up to or during the typical wind-down phase. There are also notable periods of elevated heart rate between 2-3 PM (13.48 bpm, Z-score of 1.19), which may correspond to post-lunch activity or other daily events.

Sleep statistics indicate a generous median sleep duration of 8 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score of 1.39), well above the population mean. The variability in sleep duration is relatively low (85 minutes, Z-score of -0.35). However, the median sleep start time is late, at 00:46:30, with a standard deviation of 52 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The absence of daily naps (Value of 0.0, Z-score of -0.86) is consistent with a generally regular sleep schedule, despite the late start time.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators that can inform the overall PSQI score ranking. On the positive side, the participant reports a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms and anxiety, and their self-esteem is within the average range. They also report a generous median sleep duration (8 hours 18 minutes), which is significantly longer than the population average. The low intradaily variability in heart rate suggests a generally regulated physiological system throughout the day.

However, several factors may contribute to a higher PSQI score. The participant's frequent consumption of wine or liquor, coupled with minimal engagement in physical exercise and a late median sleep start time, could negatively impact sleep quality. While the absolute sleep duration is long, the late bedtime might be indicative of difficulties initiating sleep or maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, which are common components of poor sleep quality. The moderate health satisfaction is also not a strong indicator of excellent sleep. The correlations provided are mostly low and not strongly indicative of a specific PSQI group. However, the positive correlation between stress and PSQI score (0.2) is noted, though the participant's stress score is low. The positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSQI score (0.2) is also a factor, although the participant's sleep duration variability is low. The negative correlation between health satisfaction and PSQI score (-0.21) and trust and PSQI score (-0.21) suggest that higher scores in these areas are associated with better sleep quality, which the participant does not fully exhibit.

Considering the available evidence, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. While the extended sleep duration and low levels of common psychological distress are favorable, the late sleep onset, frequency of alcohol consumption, and low engagement in physical activity present potential risks for poorer sleep quality. Without direct PSQI scores, we must infer based on contributing factors. Given the robust sleep duration and generally stable psychological state, it is plausible that the participant's sleep quality, while not necessarily optimal, falls within a more average range of the distribution. The significant positive Z-score for sleep duration suggests this metric alone might elevate their standing in terms of subjective sleep quantity.

Therefore, the evidence leans towards the participant likely having a PSQI score in the **bottom 50%** of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality, primarily driven by the substantial reported sleep duration.

33133,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators, with notable implications for sleep quality. A significantly elevated score on the CES-D scale (31.0, Z-score 1.84) suggests a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, which is positively correlated with PSQI score (0.49). This is further compounded by a moderately high STAI-Trait anxiety score (49.0, Z-score 0.76), also showing a positive correlation with PSQI (0.4). While self-esteem is within the average range (Score: 37.0, Z-Score: -0.17), the co-occurrence of high depressive and anxiety symptoms could contribute to sleep disturbances.

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate levels of substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are polarized; the participant exercises alone three times a week or more (Z-Score 1.07) but not at all with others (Z-Score -1.58), and engages in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-Score 0.91). This suggests a preference for solitary physical activity. Daily recreational habits indicate significant internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-Score 1.52), moderate listening to music (31 minutes an hour), and socializing with friends (1-2 hours), while activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading are engaged in minimally or not at all. These leisure patterns, particularly the extensive internet usage, may influence sleep onset and quality.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, evidenced by an interdaily stability of 0.4 (Z-score -0.08) and an intradaily variability of 0.63 (Z-score 0.6). The mesor of 73.53 (Z-score -0.06) and amplitude of 10.11 (Z-score -0.22) are within typical ranges, with the acrophase occurring in the late afternoon at 4:25 PM. Resting heart rate is average (58.6 bpm, Z-score 0.05). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of lower physiological arousal during the night, particularly between 1-2 AM and 2-3 AM, with the most pronounced negative deviations observed in the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM). Conversely, heart rate tends to elevate in the late morning (8-9 AM, Z-score 2.09) and early evening (5-6 PM, Z-score 0.83), reflecting typical diurnal activity patterns.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score -0.68), which is slightly below the population average. The standard deviation for sleep duration (63 minutes, Z-score -0.85) suggests a relatively consistent sleep length, though perhaps not optimally consolidated. The median sleep start time is late at 00:40:29, with a standard deviation of 101 minutes (Z-score 0.39), indicating variability in bedtime. The average daily nap rate is low (0.09, Z-score 0.21).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a likelihood of being in the **top 50%** of the study population for PSQI score, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. Firstly, the significantly elevated scores on both the CES-D (indicating depression) and STAI-Trait (indicating anxiety) scales are strongly associated with poorer sleep quality, as supported by their positive correlations with PSQI (0.49 and 0.4, respectively). These psychological factors are known to disrupt sleep architecture and subjective sleep experience.

Secondly, while the participant engages in regular solitary exercise, their sedentary habits, particularly extensive internet usage (3-4 hours daily), may negatively impact sleep hygiene and contribute to delayed sleep onset. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes is below average, and while the daily variability in sleep duration is not high, the late sleep start time and its variability could indicate difficulty initiating sleep or maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. The negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with PSQI, although moderate, also suggest that lower levels of these traits, even if within the average range as in this case for self-esteem, could contribute to poorer sleep. The absence of strong positive correlations between most wearable metrics and PSQI, coupled with the presence of significant psychological distress, points towards a sleep quality that is likely compromised.

47810,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"This participant exhibits a moderate level of depressive symptoms and below-average levels of chronic anxiety, as indicated by their CES-D and STAI-Trait scores, respectively. Their self-esteem is within the average range, and they report lower-than-average happiness. Notably, their health satisfaction is significantly below the study population average, despite a healthy Body Mass Index. In terms of lifestyle, the participant consumes wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average, while abstaining from beer and recreational drugs. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week, both alone and with others, and sports participation also at this frequency. Daily sedentary recreational habits are limited, with minimal time spent on watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage. Socializing with friends and reading are also reported as infrequent or not performed.

Analysis of wearable data reveals a notably high intraday variability in heart rate, with a Z-score of 2.01, suggesting a disorganized or less regular physiological rhythm throughout the day. While the mesor (average heart rate) and amplitude of the circadian rhythm are within the population average, the acrophase is recorded at 4:46 PM. The heart rate deviation from the mesor during nocturnal hours (2 AM to 6 AM) shows significant negative deviations, particularly between 3 AM and 6 AM, reaching a Z-score of -1.12 at 5-6 AM. This pattern suggests periods of significantly reduced physiological arousal during the early morning hours. Conversely, the participant exhibits positive deviations in heart rate from the mesor during the evening and early night (6 PM to 10 PM), with Z-scores reaching up to 1.16 at 8-9 PM, indicating heightened physiological activity during this period.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 40 minutes, which is below the population average, and a sleep duration standard deviation suggesting moderate consistency. The median sleep start time is late, at 1:26 AM, with a sleep start time standard deviation that is also below the population average, implying a relatively consistent (though late) sleep onset. The participant also reports a relatively high frequency of daily naps, with a Z-score of 2.34, suggesting a tendency to sleep during the day.

The participant's PSQI score would likely fall in the **top_50** percentile of the study population. This conclusion is drawn from several factors: a below-average median sleep duration, a late median sleep start time, and a high frequency of daily naps, all of which are commonly associated with poorer sleep quality. While the STAI-Trait score indicates low anxiety and the CES-D indicates no significant depression, which are generally associated with better sleep, the objective sleep duration and timing, along with daytime napping behavior, are more direct indicators of sleep quality that tend to contribute to a higher PSQI score. The high intraday variability in heart rate also suggests potential sleep disruption.

58196,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by generally positive psychological indicators and active lifestyle behaviors, alongside specific patterns in physiological data that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported data indicates low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 6.0, Z = -0.76) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z = -1.02), which are favorable for psychological well-being. Self-esteem is notably high (RSES score of 46.0, Z = 1.1), and the participant reports high levels of happiness (Current happiness score of 5.0, Z = 1.64). Trust in others is within the population average (Score of 3.33, Z = 0.18), and health satisfaction is also high (Score of 6.11, Z = 1.38). Academically, the participant demonstrates strong performance with a recent GPA of 4.0.

Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant engages in regular exercise, both alone and with others, at a frequency of three times a week or more (Exercised Alone Frequency Z = 1.07, Exercised with Others Frequency Z = 1.23). Substance usage, including beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week (Beer Usage Z = 1.01, Wine or Liquor Usage Z = 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drugs are not used. Leisure activities are predominantly sedentary; the participant reports not watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is limited to 16-30 minutes (Z = -1.16), listening to music for 15 minutes or less (Z = -0.72), and socializing with friends for 31 minutes to an hour (Z = -0.62). Reading is not a reported activity (Z = -0.67).

Wearable data reveals a somewhat irregular circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Value of 0.34, Z = -0.57), suggesting less consistency in daily physiological patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is high (Value of 0.66, Z = 0.81), which could indicate more fluctuations within a day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Value of 0.22, Z = -0.87), further supporting a less rigid daily rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate) is within the lower range of the population (Value of 66.57, Z = -1.01), and the amplitude is also lower than average (Value of 8.84, Z = -0.63), indicating a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly below the population average (Value of 53.4, Z = -0.56).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor highlights significant differences throughout the day. During the late-night and early-morning hours (12 AM to 6 AM), heart rates are consistently below the Mesor, with the largest negative deviations observed between 1 AM and 5 AM (e.g., 1-2 AM: -16.06, Z = -1.18; 3-4 AM: -16.4, Z = -0.01). Heart rates begin to rise above the Mesor around 7 AM and continue to increase through the morning and early afternoon, peaking between 3 PM and 4 PM (e.g., 3-4 PM: 14.39, Z = 0.99; 4-5 PM: 12.25, Z = 0.51). There is a notable dip in heart rate deviation in the late afternoon (5-6 PM: 4.15, Z = -0.93) followed by a rise in the evening hours (e.g., 9-10 PM: 13.57, Z = 0.96), and a decrease again towards late night. This pattern suggests a significant physiological shift towards lower arousal during typical sleep hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 33 minutes (Z = -0.79), which is less than the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 82 minutes (Z = -0.42), suggesting moderate variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is very late, at 1:01 AM, with a standard deviation of 72 minutes (Z = -0.24), indicating some variability in sleep onset. The participant also reports a mean of 0.15 daily naps (Z = 0.94), which is higher than the population average.

Correlations between various metrics and the PSQI score suggest several potential influences on sleep quality. Higher CES-D scores are associated with a moderate positive correlation (0.49), indicating that even mild increases in depressive symptoms could be linked to poorer sleep. Similarly, higher STAI scores show a moderate positive correlation (0.4), suggesting that anxiety proneness might contribute to sleep disturbances. Lower self-esteem (RSES Score Correlation = -0.35) and lower happiness (Current Happiness Score Correlation = -0.26) are weakly correlated with better sleep quality, implying that improvements in these areas might be associated with higher PSQI scores. Higher stress levels show a weak positive correlation (0.2) with PSQI score, suggesting stress could be detrimental to sleep. Health satisfaction shows a weak negative correlation (-0.21), meaning higher satisfaction is linked to better sleep. Substance usage, particularly beer and wine/liquor, shows very weak positive correlations (0.03 and 0.06 respectively), suggesting minimal impact on sleep quality in this individual. Exercise frequency shows weak negative correlations (-0.08 and -0.09), indicating that more frequent exercise is associated with better sleep. The late sleep start time is associated with a weak positive correlation (0.18) with PSQI, implying a later bedtime could correlate with poorer sleep quality. Napping frequency shows a weak positive correlation (0.18) with PSQI, suggesting that more naps might be associated with worse sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely falls into the **bottom_50** percentile for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 33 minutes is below the population average, and the sleep start time is quite late (1:01 AM), these factors are not strongly correlated with significantly poorer sleep quality based on the provided correlation coefficients. The median sleep duration has a weak positive correlation (0.05) with PSQI, and the sleep start time standard deviation has a weak positive correlation (0.18). The positive psychological indicators, including low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and happiness, are generally associated with better sleep quality, and indeed, the self-esteem and happiness scores have negative correlations with the PSQI score (-0.35 and -0.26 respectively), indicating that higher levels of these traits are associated with lower, or better, PSQI scores. Furthermore, the participant's high health satisfaction is also weakly correlated with better sleep quality (-0.21).

Although the wearer data indicates some irregularities in circadian rhythm (low interdaily stability and autocorrelation), these metrics do not have strong correlations with the PSQI score. The significant physiological shifts observed in the hourly heart rate data, with heart rates consistently below Mesor during typical sleep hours, are indicative of a body preparing for rest. The average number of naps is slightly higher than the population average and shows a weak positive correlation with PSQI (0.18), suggesting that this behavior might contribute slightly to a less optimal sleep profile, but not enough to suggest a top-half PSQI score. In summary, the overwhelming influence of positive psychological traits and the generally favorable correlations with measures of well-being and health satisfaction outweigh the indications of less than ideal sleep timing and duration in placing this participant in the bottom 50th percentile of PSQI scores.

The participant exhibits generally low levels of psychological distress, with a CES-D score indicative of no significant depressive symptoms (Z-score: -0.97) and a STAI-Trait score suggesting low chronic anxiety (Z-score: -0.82). Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score: 0.96), which is inversely correlated with PSQI score, suggesting potentially better sleep quality. Current happiness levels are slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53), and perceived stress is relatively low (Z-score: -0.17). Health satisfaction is above average (Z-score: 0.63). Academic performance is strong, with GPAs consistently above 3.7. Trust levels are near the population mean (Z-score: -0.14).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores indicating higher than average usage (1.01 and 0.94 respectively). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-scores: -0.31 and -0.11). Physical activity is frequent, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07), and exercising with others and participating in sports occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits show a strong preference for sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, which are reportedly not engaged in. Video game usage is minimal (15 minutes or less), and internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours). Socializing with friends and reading are also reported as not being done, which is contrary to expectations given the reported exercise habits.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.14). The mesor of their heart rate rhythm is above average (Z-score: 0.56), and the amplitude is also above average (Z-score: 0.47), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is around 4:23 PM. Intradaily variability in heart rate is notably low (Z-score: -1.59), indicating a highly regular heart rate pattern throughout the day. Interdaily stability, reflecting the consistency of the daily rhythm across days, is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.25). The aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor reveal a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -20.96, 4-5 AM: -22.2, 5-6 AM: -23.21), aligning with typical sleep periods. A sharp increase in heart rate is observed during the late morning and early afternoon, peaking between 2-3 PM (14.47), which is significantly higher than the average deviation. Heart rate then gradually decreases through the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is longer than the population average (Z-score: 0.59). The variability in sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score: -0.82), suggesting more consistent sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is late, around 11:56 PM, with moderate variability in start times. Napping behavior is reported as absent.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators that suggest a potentially good or average sleep quality, placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are often associated with poorer sleep quality. Their high self-esteem, while inversely correlated with PSQI, suggests a general well-being that may extend to sleep. The participant also reports above-average health satisfaction.

From the wearable data, the median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes is within the generally recommended range and is longer than the population average, indicating sufficient sleep duration. The low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: -1.59) is a strong indicator of physiological regularity, which is often associated with better sleep quality. The pronounced dip in heart rate during typical sleep hours further supports the notion of restful periods. The low variability in sleep duration also suggests consistency.

While the sleep start time is late (23:56), the duration is adequate, and the stability of sleep onset is moderate. The absence of daily naps also contributes positively.

The correlations provided also offer some insight. For instance, a negative correlation between self-esteem and PSQI score (-0.35) suggests that higher self-esteem is associated with lower (better) PSQI scores. Conversely, a positive correlation between stress and PSQI score (0.20) indicates that higher stress is linked to higher (worse) PSQI scores. Given the participant's low stress levels, this might suggest a better PSQI score.

Considering the combination of low psychological distress, adequate and consistent sleep duration, and physiological regularity as indicated by the wearable data, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

This participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by elevated psychological distress and moderate engagement in certain lifestyle behaviors, alongside indications of a disrupted circadian rhythm. Self-reported measures reveal significant levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 2.26) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.55), placing them in the higher range for these traits within the study population. Concurrently, self-esteem appears to be at an average or slightly below-average level (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.87). Happiness is notably low (Happy Z-score: -1.61), and while stress levels are slightly above average (Stress Z-score: 0.38), the presence of pronounced depressive and anxious symptoms suggests a significant psychological burden. Health satisfaction is also at an average level (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.38).

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor ""1-2 times a month,"" with Z-scores indicating this is slightly above the population mean for these categories. Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity patterns suggest a mixed approach: exercising alone ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.32) and engaging in sports ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Z-score: -0.42), while exercising with others occurs with higher frequency, ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.23), indicating a preference for social exercise. Daily recreational habits include considerable time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64) and moderate internet usage (Z-score: -0.49), while less time is dedicated to listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies. The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) is 25.84, which falls within the overweight category.

Analysis of wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals an interdaily stability of 0.42 (Z-score: 0.09), suggesting a somewhat regular daily pattern in heart rate, though not exceptionally strong. Intradaily variability is relatively low at 0.48 (Z-score: -0.46), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate within a 24-hour period. The acrophase, representing the peak in heart rate activity, is recorded at 3:36 PM. The mesor, or average heart rate, is 72.96 bpm (Z-score: -0.13), which is close to the population average. The resting heart rate is also within the average range (Value: 57.6, Z-score: -0.07).

Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor provides insights into the daily physiological arousal pattern. Significantly, there are pronounced negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours, with the most extreme being a deviation of -20.94 (Z-score: -0.47) between 4-5 AM and -20.2 (Z-score: -0.61) between 3-4 AM. Conversely, positive deviations are observed during the afternoon and early evening, particularly between 7-8 PM (deviation: 19.78, Z-score: 1.44) and 6-7 PM (deviation: 17.75, Z-score: 0.91). These patterns suggest a delayed onset of peak arousal and potentially a prolonged period of reduced physiological activity during typical sleep hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes (Z-score: 0.27), which is slightly longer than the population average. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 69 minutes (Z-score: -0.72), suggesting relatively consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is approximately 00:21 AM, with a standard deviation of 58 minutes (Z-score: -0.54), indicating moderate variability in sleep onset. The participant also engages in napping, with a mean of 0.24 naps per day (Z-score: 1.9), placing them in the upper range for napping frequency within the study population.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant exhibits several factors that could contribute to a poorer PSQI score, indicating sleep difficulties. The elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 2.26) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.55) are well-established correlates of impaired sleep quality. The low self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: -1.61) further supports a psychological state that is likely to negatively impact sleep. The significant deviations in heart rate during typical sleep hours, with marked decreases in the early morning, suggest a disrupted internal timing mechanism that may interfere with restorative sleep. The relatively late median sleep start time (around 00:21 AM) and the moderate variability in sleep onset, combined with the higher than average frequency of naps, can also be indicative of poor sleep hygiene or underlying sleep issues. Although median sleep duration is adequate, the overall pattern of psychological distress, physiological arousal during sleep, and behavioral habits associated with sleep initiation and maintenance suggests a propensity for lower sleep quality.

Conversely, there are few indicators that would strongly suggest a ""bottom_50"" PSQI score (representing good or average sleep quality). While sleep duration is adequate, and sleep duration variability is not particularly high, these factors alone do not outweigh the significant indicators of psychological distress and circadian disruption.

Considering the prominent presence of high psychological distress, particularly depression and anxiety, alongside a disrupted circadian physiological pattern, and a later than average sleep start time, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the top 50th percentile of the study population, signifying poorer sleep quality.

23576,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally stable psychological traits and a predominantly sedentary lifestyle with moderate engagement in physical activities. Self-reported psychological measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72), falling within the non-depressed and not anxious classifications, respectively. Self-esteem is moderately high, with a Z-score of 0.96, suggesting a positive self-perception, though this is counterbalanced by a below-average trust score (Z-score: 0.83). Happiness levels are slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53), while stress levels are also slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.17). Academic performance is strong, with GPA scores consistently at 3.94 or 4.0.

Behaviorally, the participant abstains from substance use, including alcohol, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is consistent, with exercise occurring alone three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07) and with others or in sports 1-2 times a week. Daily recreation habits are skewed towards screen time, with substantial hours spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score: 1.71), which are notably higher than the population average. Internet usage is moderate (Z-score: -0.49), while listening to music is relatively low (Z-score: -0.72). Socializing with friends occupies 1-2 hours daily (Z-score: 0.16), and reading or engaging in sedentary hobbies are not reported.

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with an interdaily stability of 0.47 (Z-score: 0.5) and intradaily variability of 0.58 (Z-score: 0.24). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.45 (Z-score: 1.06), indicating some regularity in daily patterns. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is 71.37 bpm (Z-score: -0.35), which is slightly below the population mean. The amplitude of 10.47 bpm (Z-score: -0.1) suggests a moderate diurnal variation in heart rate. The acrophase, indicating the peak of heart rate, occurs at 4:05 PM. The resting heart rate is 57.6 bpm (Z-score: -0.07), indicating a healthy resting cardiovascular state. Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns: the lowest deviations, indicating reduced physiological arousal, are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: -12.27, 2-3 AM: -16.69, 3-4 AM: -17.21, 4-5 AM: -17.6, 5-6 AM: -19.39), aligning with expected sleep physiology. Conversely, higher deviations, indicative of increased physiological activity, are observed during daylight hours, particularly in the mid-morning (e.g., 10-11 AM: 11.79) and late afternoon (e.g., 4-5 PM: 12.55).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score: 0.72), which is slightly longer than the population average. The variability in sleep duration is relatively low (Standard Deviation: 58 minutes, Z-score: -0.98), suggesting consistent sleep duration from night to night. The median sleep start time is around 12:38 AM, with moderate variability (Standard Deviation: 45 minutes, Z-score: -0.83). Notably, the participant reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators that may influence the participant's overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On the positive side, the participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, and a strong academic record, which are generally associated with better sleep. Their substance use is negligible, and they engage in regular physical activity. The wearable data suggests a relatively stable circadian rhythm and a healthy resting heart rate. Furthermore, the median sleep duration is 7 hours and 46 minutes, which is above the typical recommended range and indicates a sufficient quantity of sleep. The low variability in sleep duration and start time further points towards a structured and consistent sleep schedule.

However, several factors could contribute to a less optimal PSQI score. The participant reports a moderate amount of time spent on passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, which can sometimes interfere with sleep quality. While self-esteem is high, trust is moderately low. The correlation between many of the factors and the PSQI score are generally weak, with a few exceptions. For instance, stress has a weak positive correlation (0.2), and depression has a weak positive correlation (0.49), suggesting that increases in these areas might be associated with poorer sleep quality, though the participant's current scores in these domains are not elevated.

Considering the overall pattern, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing relatively good to average sleep quality. The substantial sleep duration, consistency in sleep timing and duration, and low psychological distress are strong indicators of good sleep. While passive screen time is a potential concern, its correlation with PSQI is mild. The median PSQI score for the population is 6.0, with a 75th percentile of 8.0. Given the consistent and sufficient sleep duration, low distress, and structured daily routines indicated by the data, it is more likely that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the bottom 50% of the distribution, indicating better-than-average or average sleep quality.

93485,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"This participant exhibits a generally balanced psychological profile and engagement in certain health-promoting behaviors, alongside some indicators of elevated physiological arousal during specific periods of the day. Their self-reported CES-D score (6.0) falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a Z-score of -0.76, suggesting a lower burden of depressive symptoms compared to the study population. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score (35.0) indicates a ""not anxious"" classification (Z-score of -0.62), implying lower levels of chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 44.0 and a Z-score of 0.82, placing them above the mean for self-worth. Their current happiness level is moderate (3.0, Z-score -0.53), and stress levels are below average (20.0, Z-score -0.44). Health satisfaction is particularly high (6.67, Z-score 1.8), suggesting a positive self-perception of physical well-being. In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports moderate substance usage (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. They actively engage in exercise, performing it alone three times a week or more, although exercise with others and sports participation are infrequent. Daily recreational habits include moderate internet (1-2 hours) and music listening, with limited time spent on reading and socializing. Notably, sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games are not engaged in.

Analysis of wearable data reveals patterns in circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The mesor (average heart rate) of 72.76 (Z-score -0.16) is within the normal range. The amplitude of 16.65 (Z-score 1.9) is notably high, suggesting a significant fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate strong regularity; interdaily stability is high (0.53, Z-score 1.0), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also elevated (0.47, Z-score 1.23), suggesting consistent daily patterns. However, intradaily variability is moderate (0.61, Z-score 0.46). The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is reported as 4:00 PM. A key observation from the aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor is a pattern of significant hypo-arousal during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM, with the most pronounced negative deviations occurring between 3-4 AM (-29.13) and 4-5 AM (-32.15). Conversely, there is a marked increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late morning and early afternoon, peaking between 1 PM and 2 PM (20.84). This pattern suggests a robust biological rhythm with a tendency towards lower physiological arousal during sleep hours and heightened arousal during active daytime periods.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 1 minute, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.2), but the standard deviation of sleep duration is also lower than average (70 minutes, Z-score -0.69), suggesting a relatively consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:58:14), with a standard deviation of 81 minutes, indicating some variability in bedtime. There are no reported daily naps. The participant's resting heart rate is notably low (47.3, Z-score -1.29), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness.

Based on the presented data, the participant's PSQI score would likely fall in the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While their median sleep duration is slightly below the population average and there is some variability in sleep start time, these factors are offset by several positive indicators. Their psychological profile is largely positive, characterized by low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and good health satisfaction, which are generally associated with better sleep. The wearable data highlights a well-structured circadian rhythm with high interdaily stability, suggesting a predictable daily physiological pattern. The notable hypo-arousal during the late night and early morning hours, despite the significant amplitude in heart rate variation, could be indicative of a physiological state conducive to sleep consolidation, rather than disruption. The low resting heart rate also suggests good overall physical health, which often correlates with better sleep quality. The lack of significant negative correlations between most measured variables and the PSQI score further supports this conclusion. The positive correlation between sleep duration standard deviation and PSQI score suggests that less variability in sleep duration is associated with lower (better) PSQI scores, and this participant has a lower than average SD.

62617,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"The participant exhibits several characteristics that provide insight into their psychological state and behavioral patterns, particularly in relation to sleep. Self-reported measures indicate a low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 1.0, Z-score of -1.28) and low levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 28.0, Z-score of -1.31). Conversely, this participant reports higher than average self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 47.0, Z-score of 1.24) and happiness (Z-score of 1.64). Trust in others is also above average (Z-score of 1.47), and health satisfaction is slightly higher than the population mean (Z-score of 0.38). Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor used 1-2 times a week, and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise is a regular habit, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more, and exercising with others or participating in sports occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational activities show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with minimal time dedicated to video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, or other sedentary hobbies.

Analysis of wearable-derived metrics reveals a highly regular sleep schedule and physiological rhythm. The participant demonstrates strong interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.73) and low intradaily variability (Z-score of -1.45) in heart rate, suggesting a consistent circadian rhythm. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs around 5:03 PM. The mesor (midline estimating rhythm assessment) of 78.2 is slightly above average, and the amplitude of 7.67 is below average, indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the population. The resting heart rate is within the average range (Value: 60.6, Z-score: 0.29). Hourly deviations from the mesor indicate generally lower than expected heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM) and higher than expected rates in the evening (e.g., 7-10 PM), aligning with typical diurnal patterns. Notably, sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 25 minutes, which is substantially longer than the population average (Z-score of 1.53), and a relatively low variability in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is late, around 11:56 PM, with moderate variability. The participant does not report napping. The positive correlation between CES-D score and PSQI score (0.49) and STAI score and PSQI score (0.4) suggest that while this participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, any increase in these symptoms could be associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction are weakly negatively correlated with PSQI, suggesting these positive psychological states may be associated with better sleep.

Given the participant's consistently long sleep duration (median of 8 hours 25 minutes, Z-score of 1.53), low reported depressive symptoms and anxiety, and high self-esteem and happiness, it is likely that their PSQI score falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The strong regularity in their circadian rhythm and heart rate further supports this conclusion. Although the median sleep start time is late, the long duration and low variability suggest this is a consistent and potentially restorative sleep pattern for this individual. The strong positive correlations of depressive symptoms and anxiety with PSQI scores, coupled with the participant's low scores in these areas, reinforce the likelihood of better sleep quality.

This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological rhythms, with notable patterns that may inform sleep quality. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a moderate level of anxiety (STAI Score: 42.0, Z-score: 0.07) and a classification of ""anxious,"" with a moderate positive correlation (0.4) with PSQI score. Depressive symptoms are not elevated (CESD Score: 15.0, Z-score: 0.18, Classification: ""Not depressed""), and the correlation with PSQI is moderate (0.49). Self-esteem appears to be within an average range (SelfEsteem Score: 37.0, Z-Score: -0.17), with a negative correlation (-0.35) suggesting higher self-esteem may be associated with better sleep quality. Trust in others is slightly higher than average (Score: 3.67, Z-Score: 0.83), exhibiting a weak negative correlation (-0.21) with PSQI. Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Current: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53), with a negative correlation (-0.27). Stress levels are notable (Score: 25.0, Z-Score: 0.92), showing a moderate positive correlation (0.2) with PSQI. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Score: 4.67, Z-score: 0.3), with a weak negative correlation (-0.21).

Behavioral habits reveal a high frequency of exercise, specifically ""Exercised Alone"" (Frequency: ""Three times a week or more"", Z-Score: 1.07), which shows a weak negative correlation (-0.09) with PSQI. Conversely, exercising with others and participating in sports occur less frequently (""1-2 times a month""). Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of beer, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, and infrequent use of wine or liquor (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational activities include significant amounts of ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (Time: ""31 minutes an hour"", Z-Score: 0.64) and ""Sedentary Hobby"" (Time: ""1-2 hours"", Z-Score: 1.41), both of which show weak positive correlations with PSQI. Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours), while listening to music and socializing with friends are reported for shorter durations. Reading time is limited to ""15 minutes or less"".

Wearable data illuminates the participant's physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. The mesor of the heart rate (Mesor: 62.62, Z-Score: -1.55) is notably lower than the population average, suggesting a lower overall resting heart rate. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also lower than average (Amplitude: 8.56, Z-Score: -0.72), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak in heart rate, occurs around 3:19 PM. The resting heart rate is on the lower side (Value: 50.3, Z-Score: -0.93), which aligns with a lower mesor. The participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by a moderate interdaily stability (Value: 0.45, Z-Score: 0.33) and relatively high intradaily variability (Value: 0.63, Z-Score: 0.6).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct diurnal patterns. Significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate, are observed during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: -13.33, 2-3 AM: -17.70, 3-4 AM: -20.30, 4-5 AM: -20.63, 5-6 AM: -20.42), consistent with sleep and reduced physiological arousal. Conversely, pronounced positive deviations, signifying elevated heart rate, are evident during mid-morning (9-10 AM: 19.76, 10-11 AM: 19.79) and late afternoon (4-5 PM: 27.38), suggesting periods of higher physiological activity or arousal.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above the population average and shows a weak positive correlation with PSQI (0.05). The standard deviation of sleep duration is within the average range, with a slight negative correlation (-0.25) suggesting more consistent sleep durations might be associated with better sleep quality. The median sleep start time is around 00:31, with a standard deviation of 78 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The frequency of daily naps is very low.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data suggests that this participant is likely to have a PSQI score in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

Evidence supporting a lower PSQI score includes a relatively healthy sleep duration (7 hours 18 minutes median), which is slightly above the population mean. While not a direct PSQI component, the low resting heart rate and mesor, coupled with a generally stable circadian rhythm, suggest good physiological regulation which often underpins quality sleep. Furthermore, the participant reports minimal substance use and a high frequency of exercising alone, habits generally associated with better well-being. The negative correlation of self-esteem with PSQI (-0.35) is a positive indicator, and this participant's self-esteem score is within a healthy range. The moderate anxiety and slightly below-average happiness are noted, but their correlations with PSQI are moderate and do not overwhelmingly suggest poor sleep.

Conversely, there is limited strong evidence to suggest a high PSQI score. While stress levels are elevated (Z-Score: 0.92) and show a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (0.2), this alone is not sufficient to place the participant in the top half. The significant time spent on ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and ""Sedentary Hobby"" are weak positive correlations with PSQI and do not represent critical risk factors for poor sleep quality in isolation.

Holistically, the participant's objective sleep duration and physiological rhythm stability, combined with the absence of significant unhealthy behaviors, lean towards an average to good sleep quality profile. The presence of moderate anxiety and stress, while worth noting, does not appear to be a dominant factor driving poor sleep in this dataset.

48013,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits and behaviors, with notable indicators of heightened anxiety and depressive symptomatology. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 55.0, with a Z-score of 1.35, suggests a significant level of chronic anxiety compared to the study population. This is further corroborated by a CES-D score of 19.0 (Z-score = 0.59), indicating a moderate frequency of depressive symptoms in the past week. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be relatively low, as indicated by a Self-Esteem score of 28.0 (Z-score = -1.43), and happiness is also reported as low (Current = 2.0, Z-score = -1.61). The participant also reports higher than average stress levels (Score = 25.0, Z-score = 0.92). This constellation of psychological markers suggests a participant who may be experiencing considerable emotional distress.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits relatively low trust in others (Score = 2.17, Z-score = -2.07), which aligns with their psychological profile. In terms of lifestyle habits, the participant engages in frequent exercise, reporting exercising alone and with others ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), and participating in sports ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score = 0.91). This level of physical activity is notable. Substance usage is moderate, with wine or liquor consumed ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score = 0.94), and beer ""1-2 times a month"" (Z-score = 0.3). Notably, the participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreation habits include significant time spent ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = 0.64), ""Internet Usage"" (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.85), and ""Listening to Music"" (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13). They report minimal time spent on sedentary hobbies (16-30 minutes, Z-score = 0.23) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.16).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a resting heart rate of 59.3 bpm (Z-score = 0.14), which is within the typical range. The cosinor analysis of heart rate data indicates a Mesor of 77.46 bpm (Z-score = 0.48), suggesting a moderately elevated average heart rate. The amplitude of 7.44 bpm (Z-score = -1.08) is lower than average, indicating less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded as 4:28 PM. The circadian rhythm metrics suggest a less regular daily rhythm, as indicated by low Interdaily Stability (Value = 0.23, Z-score = -1.48) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value = 0.14, Z-score = -1.54). Intradaily Variability is moderate (Value = 0.47, Z-score = -0.53). Examining the aggregated hourly deviation from the Mesor, a notable pattern emerges in the late night and early morning hours. Heart rate deviations are significantly negative between 1 AM and 6 AM, with the largest dips occurring between 3-4 AM (-19.16, Z-score = -0.45) and 4-5 AM (-20.4, Z-score = -0.38). Conversely, significant positive deviations are observed in the morning, particularly between 6-7 AM (8.33, Z-score = 3.5) and 7-8 AM (6.85, Z-score = 2.07), indicating a period of increased physiological arousal upon waking.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes (Z-score = -0.31), which is slightly below average but within a reasonable range. However, the standard deviation for sleep duration is notably high at 151 minutes (Z-score = 1.13), suggesting considerable variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late at 01:04:30 AM, and the standard deviation for sleep start time is also elevated at 119 minutes (Z-score = 0.8), indicating a highly irregular sleep schedule. The average daily nap frequency is low (0.07, Z-score = -0.08).

The correlation coefficients provided offer further insight into potential relationships with sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Higher CES-D and STAI scores, as well as higher stress levels, show positive correlations with PSQI, suggesting that increased depression, anxiety, and stress are associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, and happiness scores are negatively correlated with PSQI, indicating that better psychological well-being is linked to better sleep. Higher frequency of exercise is negatively correlated with PSQI, suggesting that physical activity may be beneficial for sleep. Negative correlations are also observed for health satisfaction. Regarding behavioral data, while most correlations with the PSQI are weak, a slight positive association is noted for 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' and 'Internet Usage', and a slight negative association for 'Socializing with Friends'.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data suggests that this participant likely has a PSQI score in the **top_50** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The participant exhibits significant psychological distress, characterized by high levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.35) and moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 0.59). These psychological states are positively correlated with PSQI scores in the dataset, meaning they are associated with worse sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports low self-esteem (Z-score = -1.43) and low happiness (Z-score = -1.61), which are also negatively correlated with PSQI.

Behaviorally, while the participant engages in regular exercise, which is generally beneficial, their daily recreation habits include significant screen time (""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and ""Internet Usage""), which have a slight positive correlation with PSQI. Critically, the wearable data highlights significant irregularities in sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is just under 7 hours, which is acceptable, but the high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score = 1.13) and sleep start time (Z-score = 0.8) are strong indicators of poor sleep hygiene and potentially fragmented sleep. The late median sleep start time (01:04:30 AM) further suggests a disrupted circadian rhythm. The low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.48) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -1.54) in heart rate data further support the notion of an inconsistent daily physiological rhythm, which often correlates with poor sleep quality. While not all indicators point towards poor sleep, the confluence of psychological distress and significant sleep schedule irregularity, coupled with the provided correlation data, strongly suggests that this participant's PSQI score would fall in the upper half of the distribution.

This participant exhibits a generally low burden of self-reported psychological distress. Their scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait) are significantly below the study population means (Z-scores of -1.38 and -2.11, respectively), classifying them as not depressed and not anxious. Furthermore, their trust in others is notably high (Z-score of -2.39), and self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score of 1.1). Interestingly, despite these positive indicators, self-reported happiness is also above average (Z-score of 1.64). Stress levels are considerably lower than the average participant (Z-score of -2.62). Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score of -0.45), which is a notable contrast to their positive psychological indicators.

In terms of behavioral habits, this participant reports no substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, placing them well below the population average for substance use. They also report minimal engagement in exercise, with infrequent or no participation in exercising alone, with others, or in sports, evidenced by significantly negative Z-scores for these activities. This sedentary lifestyle is further underscored by extensive engagement in passive leisure activities. The participant reports spending ""more than 4 hours"" daily on watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and listening to music, and also more than 4 hours on sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends also occupies ""more than 4 hours"" daily, which is an unusual pattern for passive activities, and reading is limited to 16-30 minutes daily. These substantial daily durations in passive and screen-based activities are significantly higher than the study population, indicated by high positive Z-scores.

The wearable data reveals a highly regular circadian rhythm, as suggested by a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score of 2.4) and a low Intradaily Variability (Z-score of -2.29) in heart rate. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also strong (Z-score of 2.24), reinforcing the predictability of their daily physiological patterns. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Z-score of 1.35), and the Amplitude of the rhythm is also higher (Z-score of 1.72). The Acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:51 PM). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates periods of significantly reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 2 AM and 6 AM. Heart rate begins to increase from approximately 8 AM and remains elevated throughout the day and into the evening, peaking between 7 PM and 10 PM, before gradually declining. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.51).

Regarding sleep statistics, the median sleep duration is approximately 7 hours and 14 minutes, which is very close to the population average (Z-score of 0.06). The standard deviation of sleep duration is notably low (Z-score of -1.48), suggesting consistent sleep duration night-to-night. The median sleep start time is around 1:04 AM, with a standard deviation of 54 minutes for sleep start time, indicating moderate variability in bedtime. The mean number of daily naps is minimal, aligning with the population average.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we analyze the provided data in relation to the population's PSQI distribution. The population mean PSQI is 6.73, with a median of 6.0, a 25th percentile of 5.0, and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score below the median (6.0) would be considered good sleep quality and fall in the bottom 50%. Scores above the median would indicate poorer sleep quality and fall in the top 50%.

Several factors suggest that this participant's sleep quality might be towards the lower end of the PSQI distribution, indicating better sleep. Their psychological profile is largely positive: they report low levels of depression (CES-D Z-score: -1.38), anxiety (STAI Z-score: -2.11), and stress (Stress Z-score: -2.62). High trust (Trust Z-score: -2.39) and above-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.1) and happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64) are also indicative of a favorable psychological state, which often correlates with better sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits no substance use, which is conducive to good sleep. While their exercise habits are very limited, this does not directly imply poor sleep quality. However, their extensive daily engagement in screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage (""more than 4 hours"" daily for each) and sedentary hobbies (""more than 4 hours"") could potentially negatively impact sleep initiation or quality, though the direct correlation coefficients provided are modest for most of these activities.

The wearable data shows strong circadian rhythmicity (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability), which is generally associated with better sleep regulation. The resting heart rate is slightly above average, but not excessively so. The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes, which is within a healthy range, and importantly, the sleep duration has low variability (Z-score: -1.48), suggesting consistent sleep length. The median sleep start time is relatively late (1:04 AM), but the variability in sleep start time is moderate. The lack of significant daytime napping also supports healthier sleep patterns.

Considering the overall pattern, the strong positive psychological indicators, lack of substance use, consistent sleep duration, and regular circadian rhythm lean towards better sleep quality. While the sedentary lifestyle and extensive screen time are potential detriments, the other factors seem to outweigh them in predicting overall sleep quality. The provided correlations, while not the sole determinant, show a mix of positive and negative associations with PSQI score. For instance, higher stress correlates with higher PSQI scores (0.19), which is not present here. Lower self-esteem and happiness correlate with higher PSQI scores (-0.35 and -0.26, respectively), which is also not the case. The consistent sleep duration is a strong positive indicator for good sleep quality.

Given these findings, the participant's sleep quality, as inferred from these multimodal data, is likely to be better than average, placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution.

69057,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that likely influence their sleep quality. Self-reported data indicate a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.16), coupled with lower than average trust of others (Trust Z-score: -1.42) and slightly reduced happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Notably, the participant reports not being depressed (CESD Z-score: -0.14) and demonstrates average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.45). Lifestyle behaviors reveal a pattern of moderate substance usage (Beer and Wine/Liquor: 1-2 times a month) and a low frequency of recreational drug use. Physical activity levels suggest regular exercise alone (Three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07), but less frequent engagement in sports or exercising with others. Daily recreation habits include moderate screen time (Watching TV/Videos/Movies: 16-30 minutes; Internet Usage: 31 minutes an hour) and a significant amount of time listening to music (1-2 hours).

From wearable data, the participant displays a notably low resting heart rate (Value: 43.6, Z-score: -1.73), suggesting a potentially high level of physical fitness or a naturally lower cardiovascular baseline. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a flattened diurnal heart rate variation, indicated by a low Mesor (Value: 57.89, Z-score: -2.19) and Amplitude (Value: 8.68, Z-score: -0.68). The Acrophase, the peak in heart rate, is observed around 5:40 PM. The chronobiological metrics of Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.32, Z-score: -0.74) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.26, Z-score: -0.53) are low, suggesting a less regular and predictable daily rhythm in heart rate. This is further supported by the hourly deviations from the Mesor, which show significant negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM: -19.08, 5-6 AM: -22.51), indicative of prolonged periods of low physiological activity during these times, consistent with sleep. The highest positive deviations from the Mesor occur in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 22.77, 7-8 PM: 16.1), potentially reflecting periods of increased daily activity or social engagement.

Sleep statistics highlight a significant concern regarding sleep duration, with a median sleep of only 5 hours and 35 minutes, which is substantially below average for the study population (Z-score: -1.99). This short sleep duration is also characterized by a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Value: 122 minutes, Z-score: 0.49), implying considerable day-to-day variability in sleep obtained. The median sleep start time is very late at 02:08:15, further supported by a relatively low sleep start time standard deviation (Value: 53 minutes, Z-score: -0.66), suggesting a consistently late sleep schedule rather than erratic timing. The minimal average daily naps (Value: 0.07, Z-score: -0.08) indicate no significant compensatory napping behavior to offset insufficient nocturnal sleep.

Considering the provided data, particularly the short median sleep duration (5 hours 35 minutes, significantly below the population mean of likely 7-8 hours and a Z-score of -1.99), the inconsistent sleep pattern indicated by the high sleep duration standard deviation, and the very late sleep start time, it is highly probable that this participant experiences poor sleep quality. The PSQI is designed to capture subjective sleep quality, and while direct PSQI scores are not provided, the objective and subjective sleep indicators point towards a pattern that would likely result in a high PSQI score, placing them in the top 50% of the study population. The elevated anxiety and reduced happiness, although not directly correlated with PSQI score in a strong negative direction, can often co-occur with and exacerbate poor sleep. The low interdaily stability and autocorrelation of heart rate further suggest a disrupted circadian system, which is a significant contributor to poor sleep.

64232,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with several psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant consideration in relation to their sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a low level of stress (Z-score: 1.47, which is high relative to the population mean) and moderate anxiety (STAI score: 44, Z-score: 0.27). Notably, self-reported happiness is on the lower end (Z-score: -0.53), alongside a neutral self-esteem score (Z-score: -0.17). Health satisfaction is also reported as average (Z-score: -0.03).

Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, and recreational drugs 1-2 times a month. Exercise frequency is notable, with sports engagement occurring three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.58), while exercising alone is less frequent (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.32). Daily recreation predominantly involves moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.18) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16). Notably, passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and reading are not engaged in.

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability of 0.22 (Z-score: -1.56), suggesting a consistent daily pattern. However, the Intradaily Variability is moderate (0.48, Z-score: -0.46), and the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also moderate (0.26, Z-score: -0.53). The participant's mesor heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (77.33, Z-score: 0.46), with a resting heart rate of 59.4 (Z-score: 0.15). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern: lower heart rates are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-4 AM, with deviations as low as -19.08), followed by a notable increase in heart rate from approximately 4-5 AM (deviation of 1.4) and peaking in the evening hours (e.g., 9-10 PM, deviation of 13.21). This suggests a physiological pattern of reduced activity during sleep and increased arousal in the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours, which is above the population average (Z-score: 1.01), suggesting sufficient sleep duration. However, the sleep start time is highly variable, with a median start time of 00:40:51 and a standard deviation of 150 minutes (Z-score: 1.48), indicating inconsistent sleep onset. Napping behavior is minimal (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-score: -0.86).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators that suggest the participant likely falls within the **bottom 50%** of the study population with regards to their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The most compelling evidence is the reported median sleep duration of 8 hours, which is significantly longer than the population average (Z-score: 1.01). While the PSQI is a multifaceted index, sufficient sleep duration is a foundational component of good sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports no daily naps, which generally aligns with healthier sleep patterns.

Although the sleep start time is highly variable (standard deviation of 150 minutes, Z-score: 1.48), which could contribute to a higher PSQI score, this variability may be compensated for by the adequate sleep duration achieved. The psychological measures, while showing some elevated stress and moderate anxiety, do not present with scores that are extreme outliers in a way that would strongly predict poor sleep quality in isolation. Specifically, the CES-D score suggests no significant depressive symptoms, and while STAI indicates some anxiety, it is not at a level that necessarily correlates with severely disrupted sleep. The participant's moderate happiness levels and neutral self-esteem do not strongly suggest a predisposition to poor sleep quality.

The wearable data also provides some context. The mesor and resting heart rates are within a reasonable range, and the observed heart rate patterns, while showing an evening peak, do not immediately suggest significant physiological distress that would inherently lead to poor sleep. The interdaily stability, while low, could reflect the variability in sleep start times.

Considering the strong positive indicator of sufficient sleep duration, coupled with the absence of severe psychological distress and the presence of active lifestyle habits like regular sports engagement, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing generally satisfactory sleep. Therefore, it is probable that their overall PSQI score would place them in the lower half of the distribution.

37404,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a generally positive psychological profile. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z=-0.66) and anxiety (STAI score of 35.0, Z=-0.62), suggesting a stable emotional state. Self-esteem is within the average range (Score of 38.0, Z=-0.03), and subjective happiness is also moderate (Score of 3.0, Z=-0.53). Reported stress levels are relatively low (Score of 21.0, Z=-0.17). Trust in others is also within a normal range (Score of 3.0, Z=-0.46). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA across multiple semesters, is consistently high (3.8, 3.8, 3.75). Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Score of 4.44, Z=0.13).

Behavioral habits reveal moderate substance usage patterns. Beer consumption is infrequent (1-2 times a month, Z=0.3), while wine or liquor consumption is more frequent (1-2 times a week, Z=0.94). Notably, the participant reports abstaining from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is a significant component of this participant's lifestyle, with frequent solitary exercise (Three times a week or more, Z=1.07) and moderate exercise with others (1-2 times a week, Z=0.53). Sports engagement is notably absent (Not at all, Z=-1.09). Daily recreational habits are characterized by relatively low engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z=-0.62) and video games (Do not do, Z=-0.56). Internet usage and listening to music are moderate, while socializing with friends and reading are engaged in for approximately 31 minutes to an hour daily. Sedentary hobbies are minimal.

Physiological data from the wearable indicates a robust circadian rhythm, albeit with some deviations from population norms. The mesor (average heart rate level) is within the average range (73.04 bpm, Z=-0.12), but the amplitude is notably low (6.01 bpm, Z=-1.54), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:32 PM, which falls within the typical diurnal pattern. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (0.22, Z=-1.56) and intradaily variability is high (0.74, Z=1.37), suggesting a less consistent daily pattern and more variability within the day compared to the population. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (0.14, Z=-1.54), further supporting a less stable daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is slightly elevated but within a healthy range (60.8 bpm, Z=0.32). The hourly deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -15.84 at 5-6 AM, -13.81 at 4-5 AM), followed by an increase in heart rate during the day, peaking in the evening. Notably, significant negative deviations from the mesor occur in the pre-dawn hours, indicating a period of reduced physiological activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 9 minutes, which is very close to the population average (Z=-0.04). The standard deviation for sleep duration is slightly below average (66 minutes, Z=-0.78), suggesting consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is late, at approximately 12:49 AM, with a standard deviation of 65 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. Mean daily naps are zero, suggesting no reported napping behavior.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The population PSQI mean is 6.72, with a standard deviation of 2.16. The 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. This participant's psychological profile generally suggests good mental well-being, with low reported depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem and happiness. This would typically correlate with better sleep quality. Similarly, the participant exhibits positive lifestyle behaviors such as frequent exercise, and minimal engagement in passive screen time or drug use, which are generally associated with improved sleep.

The sleep duration is very close to the population average (7 hours 9 minutes, Z=-0.04). While the sleep start time is late (00:48:47), the consistency of sleep duration suggests some level of control over sleep patterns. The wearable data presents a complex picture. The low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability of heart rate, along with low autocorrelation, suggest a less structured daily physiological rhythm, which could negatively impact sleep. However, the overall pattern of heart rate deviation from the mesor does show expected diurnal fluctuations, with lower activity during sleep periods.

Considering the strong indicators of good psychological health and generally healthy lifestyle habits, these factors are likely to outweigh the nuances in the circadian rhythm metrics that suggest some irregularity. The sleep duration being very close to the population mean further supports this. Therefore, it is plausible that the participant's overall PSQI score would fall within the better half of the distribution, indicating relatively good sleep quality.

70492,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that may influence their sleep quality. Self-report data indicates moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 16, Z=0.28) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI score of 49, Z=0.76), both of which correlate positively with PSQI scores. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively low (RSES score of 34, Z=-0.59) and health satisfaction is also below average (Score of 3.44, Z=-0.62). Despite these psychological indicators, the participant reports moderate to high levels of academic engagement, as evidenced by their consistent GPA across semesters (ranging from 3.37 to 3.43). Behavioral data reveals a mixed profile: moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z=1.01) and no recreational drug use. Exercise frequency is notably low, with less than 1-2 times a month for solo exercise and 1-2 times a month for exercising with others; sports participation is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits include significant internet usage (2-3 hours, Z=0.85) and social media engagement (2-3 hours, Z=0.95), alongside listening to music (1-2 hours, Z=0.67). This pattern suggests a tendency towards sedentary leisure activities.

Wearable data provides insights into physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is within the lower range for the study population (Value of 53.6, Z=-0.54), potentially indicating good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Value of 0.43, Z=0.17) and intradaily variability (Value of 0.54, Z=-0.04), suggesting a reasonably structured daily physiological rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is also lower than the population average (Value of 69.52, Z=-0.6), and the Amplitude (daily fluctuation) is also reduced (Value of 9.42, Z=-0.44). The acrophase, representing the peak of heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (5:12 PM), which is a typical pattern. Analysis of hourly deviations from the Mesor reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (3-4 AM: -9.92, Z=1.02; 4-5 AM: -10.96, Z=1.18; 5-6 AM: -13.65, Z=0.68), followed by a significant increase in the late morning and early afternoon (11 AM - 3 PM). This pattern suggests a delayed sleep onset and a subsequent period of elevated physiological arousal during typical waking hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes (Z=-0.13), which is close to the population average. However, the variability in sleep duration is notably high (Standard Deviation of 222 minutes, Z=2.75), suggesting inconsistent sleep across nights. The median sleep start time is unusually late (3:03 AM), with a considerable standard deviation (138 minutes, Z=1.21), further reinforcing the impression of irregular sleep timing. The absence of daily naps (Value of 0.0, Z=-0.86) suggests a consistent pattern of avoiding daytime sleep, which could be an attempt to compensate for poor nighttime sleep. The positive correlations observed between higher CESD scores, higher STAI scores, and higher PSQI scores suggest that psychological distress and anxiety are associated with poorer sleep quality. The high variability in sleep duration and the late, inconsistent sleep start times are significant indicators of potential sleep disruption.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the participant's data provides several indicators that suggest their PSQI score likely falls into the **top_50** percentile of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. The self-reported data reveals elevated levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which are positively correlated with PSQI scores, suggesting a higher burden of sleep difficulties. Furthermore, the participant exhibits a pattern of irregular sleep timing, evidenced by a very late median sleep start time (3:03 AM) and a high standard deviation in sleep start times, which is a strong indicator of poor sleep quality. While the median sleep duration is within a normal range, the substantial variability in daily sleep duration suggests significant inconsistency. The physiological data, specifically the pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours and the subsequent increase in the late morning and afternoon, aligns with a disrupted circadian rhythm that often accompanies poor sleep. The lack of strong positive correlations between most behavioral habits (e.g., exercise, substance use) and PSQI, or even negative correlations (e.g., self-esteem, health satisfaction), does not strongly mitigate the evidence for poor sleep. The overall pattern of psychological distress, inconsistent sleep schedules, and potentially disrupted physiological rhythms points towards a sleep quality that is likely below average for the study population.

This participant exhibits a largely positive psychological profile, characterized by low levels of depressive and anxious symptoms, as indicated by low CES-D and STAI scores (Z-scores of -1.28 and -1.81, respectively). This is further supported by a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z-score of 1.52), suggesting a strong sense of self-worth. Self-reported happiness is also notably high (Z-score of 1.64). While stress levels are reported as moderate (Z-score of -0.98), the overall psychological disposition appears to be one of well-being.

Lifestyle behaviors are predominantly positive. The participant reports no substance usage for beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, with significantly low Z-scores for these categories. Exercise habits show a nuance; while individual exercise is infrequent (Z-score of -1.93 for 'Exercised Alone'), there is consistent engagement in exercising with others (Z-score of 1.23) and moderate participation in sports (Z-score of 0.25). Daily recreation includes substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score of 1.71), alongside moderate internet usage (Z-score of 0.18) and socializing with friends (Z-score of 0.16). Reading and sedentary hobbies occupy less time.

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a well-regulated circadian rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate) is elevated relative to the population (Z-score of 1.22), and the Amplitude is also above average (Z-score of 0.78). The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate, occurs in the early evening (6:35 PM), which is typical. The resting heart rate is also on the higher side of the population distribution (Z-score of 1.02). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the Mesor during evening and nighttime hours. Specifically, pronounced negative deviations are observed between 3 AM and 7 AM, indicating periods of lower heart rate, consistent with sleep. Conversely, positive deviations are noted from approximately 6 PM to 10 PM, coinciding with the period of highest physiological arousal before sleep. The stability of the circadian rhythm is reflected in a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score of 1.08) and a moderate Intradaily Variability (Z-score of -0.11), suggesting a regular daily pattern. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also notably high (Z-score of 1.57), further supporting a consistent daily rhythm.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes, which is slightly above the population mean and shows low variability (Z-score of 0.29 for duration and -0.92 for duration standard deviation). However, the median sleep start time is quite late at 2:25 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score of -1.08 for start time standard deviation), suggesting a tendency towards later bedtimes that are relatively consistent. The absence of daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) is also noteworthy.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely falls within the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors support this conclusion. The participant's overall psychological state is characterized by low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and high reported happiness, which are generally associated with better sleep quality. Their lifestyle is healthy, with no substance use and consistent engagement in social exercise.

The wearable data further reinforces this positive assessment of sleep. The presence of a stable circadian rhythm, indicated by high Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours, along with a typical acrophase, suggests good internal biological regulation. While the median sleep start time is late, the median sleep duration is adequate at over 7 hours, and importantly, the standard deviation of sleep duration is low, suggesting consistency. The absence of daily naps also contributes to a potentially more consolidated sleep pattern. While a detailed breakdown of PSQI domains is not provided, the convergence of positive psychological and lifestyle factors, coupled with physiological indicators of a stable circadian rhythm and sufficient sleep duration, strongly points towards a PSQI score that would be considered in the lower half of the distribution, signifying better sleep quality relative to the study cohort.

67106,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a constellation of self-reported psychological and lifestyle characteristics that warrant careful consideration in the context of sleep quality. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z-score -1.18) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 29.0, Z-score -1.22), which are generally indicative of psychological well-being. Furthermore, self-esteem is reported at a high level (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 46.0, Z-score 1.1), alongside high levels of general happiness (Current happiness score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64). A relatively high level of trust in others is also indicated (Trust score of 3.67, Z-score 0.83). The participant also reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction score of 6.22, Z-score 1.47). Their academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high across multiple semesters, ranging from 3.85 to 4.0. In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports abstaining from alcohol, wine, liquor, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs, and engages in minimal physical activity, with exercise occurring less than once or twice a month and no participation in sports. Daily recreational habits are also characterized by low engagement, with the exception of reading, listening to music, and sedentary hobbies which occupy 15-30 minutes daily. Internet usage and socializing with friends are notably low at 15 minutes or less per day.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data from the wearable device provide additional context. The participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as suggested by a high interdaily stability score (1.9 Z-score) and a moderate autocorrelation at 24 hours (2.07 Z-score). However, intradaily variability is within the average range (-0.53 Z-score), indicating a moderate level of fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor, representing the midpoint of the circadian rhythm, is slightly below population average (-0.21 Z-score), and the amplitude, reflecting the range of fluctuation, is moderately above average (0.59 Z-score). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 4:20 PM. The resting heart rate is also slightly below the population average (56.3 bpm, -0.22 Z-score).

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. The participant's heart rate is consistently lower than the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, with significant negative deviations observed between 12 AM and 7 AM, reaching a low of -21.82 during the 5-6 AM hour. This pattern suggests a period of physiological rest and reduced arousal during these hours. As the day progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, indicating elevated physiological activity. Notable peaks in positive deviation occur in the evening, specifically between 6 PM and 10 PM, with the highest deviation reaching 18.4 during the 6-7 PM hour and another significant peak of 16.52 between 8-9 PM. This suggests a period of increased physiological arousal in the early to mid-evening.

Regarding sleep statistics, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is below the average for the study population, indicated by a Z-score of -0.51. The variability in sleep duration is within the typical range (98 minutes, -0.07 Z-score). The median sleep start time is late at 1:28 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (88 minutes, 0.12 Z-score). The average number of daily naps is low (0.12, 0.61 Z-score).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a profile that leans towards better-than-average sleep quality, thus likely placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution. Several factors support this conclusion. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness, which are generally associated with better sleep quality. Their high health satisfaction further reinforces a positive well-being status. Behaviorally, while physical activity is low and social interaction is limited, the absence of substance usage is a positive indicator.

From a physiological perspective, the circadian rhythm metrics suggest a generally stable pattern, which is conducive to regular sleep. The observed pattern of heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates a clear period of low arousal during the night, consistent with sleep, and elevated arousal during the day.

However, the sleep statistics present a mixed picture. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes is below the population average and could be a potential area of concern for sleep quality. A shorter sleep duration is often associated with poorer sleep quality. The late sleep start time (1:28 AM) may also contribute to difficulties in maintaining an optimal sleep schedule. Despite these aspects, the relatively low variability in sleep duration and start time suggests a degree of consistency in their sleep patterns.

Considering the overall evidence, the positive psychological indicators, stable circadian rhythm, and consistent, albeit short, sleep duration suggest that the participant's PSQI score is more likely to fall within the bottom 50th percentile, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The low reported stress and high general happiness, in conjunction with low depression and anxiety, are strong indicators of good subjective sleep quality, often reflected in a lower PSQI score. While the duration might be slightly suboptimal, the consistency and lack of other significant negative indicators likely outweigh this factor.

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported data indicate a high level of chronic anxiety, as evidenced by a significant Z-score of 1.65 on the STAI-Trait scale, placing them in the ""anxious"" classification. This is accompanied by a moderately high stress score (Z-score of 0.38). While not classified as depressed (CES-D Z-score of 0.18), the co-occurrence of high anxiety and stress suggests a potential psychological burden that could impact sleep. Self-esteem is notably low, with a Z-score of -1.29, and trust in others is also below average (Z-score of -1.1), which could contribute to feelings of insecurity or isolation. Conversely, reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55). The participant maintains a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) of 24.21 and reports generally high health satisfaction (Z-score of -0.03, indicating slight dissatisfaction relative to peers but still a solid score). Their academic performance, reflected in GPA scores ranging from 3.7 to 3.82, is strong.

Regarding behavioral habits, substance usage is relatively low, with beer consumed less than 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a month. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" The participant engages in moderate exercise, with a frequency of 1-2 times a week for both exercising alone and with others, although participation in sports is minimal (""Not at all""). Daily recreational habits show a mix of sedentary and slightly more active pursuits. They spend 16-30 minutes daily watching TV/videos/movies, 1-2 hours on the internet, and 15 minutes or less listening to music. Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes to an hour, and they do not engage in video games or reading. A ""Sedentary Hobby"" occupies 31 minutes to an hour daily.

Wearable-derived data provides insights into physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.07), suggesting variability in daily patterns, and high intradaily variability (Z-score of 1.09), indicating significant fluctuations within a 24-hour period. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score of -1.29), further supporting a less structured daily rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate over the cycle) is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.54), and the amplitude (range of heart rate fluctuation) is also somewhat reduced (Z-score of -0.48). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (4:23 PM). The resting heart rate is relatively low (Z-score of -0.42). Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct patterns. Notably, there are significant negative deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM with a Z-score of -1.01, 2-3 AM with a Z-score of -0.52), indicating lower-than-average heart rate during these times, consistent with sleep. There are positive deviations in the afternoon and evening, peaking between 4-5 PM (Z-score of 1.04) and 9-10 PM (Z-score of 1.33), suggesting periods of higher physiological arousal.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -0.59). The variability in sleep duration is also relatively low (Z-score of -0.76). The median sleep start time is around 00:51 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score of 0.02). The absence of daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) suggests a consistent pattern of no napping.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides a complex picture when considering their overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Several factors suggest potential for a suboptimal PSQI score. The high levels of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of 1.65) and moderate stress (Z-score of 0.38) are frequently associated with poorer sleep quality. Low self-esteem (Z-score of -1.29) and lower trust (Z-score of -1.1) could also contribute to psychological distress that disrupts sleep. The wearable data reveals a less regular circadian rhythm, characterized by low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.07) and high intradaily variability (Z-score of 1.09), which are indicative of a disrupted internal clock. Furthermore, the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes is below the population mean, and the PSQI often penalizes insufficient sleep. The low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of -1.29) further suggests a lack of robust daily rhythmicity which could negatively impact sleep.

Conversely, some aspects of the data do not strongly point towards a very poor PSQI score. The participant's reported happiness is above average (Z-score of 0.55), and their health satisfaction is not significantly low. The low substance usage and consistent moderate exercise habits are generally beneficial for sleep. The aggregated hourly heart rate data, while showing variability, does indicate periods of reduced heart rate during the typical sleep window (late night to early morning), and the absence of daily naps is a positive sign. The moderate standard deviation in sleep start time suggests some regularity in their bedtime.

However, when synthesizing the evidence, the pronounced anxiety, the lack of strong circadian rhythm stability, and the shorter sleep duration are significant indicators that likely contribute to a PSQI score that falls within the poorer half of the distribution. The population mean PSQI score is 6.73, with a 75th percentile of 8.0. Given the combination of high anxiety, disrupted circadian rhythms, and below-average sleep duration, it is plausible that this participant's PSQI score would exceed the median of 6.0 and potentially the 75th percentile, placing them in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

The participant exhibits a generally low level of chronic anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of -1.71 on the STAI-Trait scale, suggesting a disposition towards being not anxious. Similarly, the CES-D score is below the typical range for depressive symptoms, with a Z-score of -0.86, classifying them as not depressed. Self-esteem appears to be a strength, with a Z-score of 1.38, indicating a higher than average self-worth. Happiness levels are also notably high, reflected by a Z-score of 1.64. Stress levels, while present, are below the population average with a Z-score of -0.98. Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z-score 1.22), aligning with a healthy Body Mass Index of 20.52 and a self-reported classification of male.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.94), and beer consumed 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.3). They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are more frequent for individual workouts, with 'Exercised Alone' reported as 'Three times a week or more' (Z-score 1.07), while exercise with others and participation in sports are less frequent (1-2 times a month). Recreational activities are predominantly sedentary, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' and 'Video Games' reported as 'Do not do', and 'Internet Usage' at 16-30 minutes. However, a considerable amount of time is dedicated to 'Socializing with Friends' (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95) and some time to 'Reading' (16-30 minutes, Z-score 1.3).

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate around which daily rhythms oscillate, is 71.36 bpm (Z-score -0.35), suggesting a resting heart rate that is slightly below average for the population. The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is 11.06 bpm (Z-score 0.09), indicating a moderate daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is recorded at 4:17 PM. Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability scores (0.4 and 0.52 respectively) are close to population averages, suggesting a moderate level of regularity in daily activity patterns.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of significantly reduced heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM with a deviation of -23.4, Z-score -1.51; 3-4 AM with a deviation of -27.48, Z-score -1.77). This pattern is consistent with deep sleep. Heart rate then gradually increases towards waking hours, with positive deviations observed from 7-8 AM onwards. Evening hours show fluctuations, with elevated heart rates in the late evening (e.g., 6-7 PM with a deviation of 20.31, Z-score 1.35) and a general trend of decreasing heart rate into the night. The participant's resting heart rate is notably low at 49.05 bpm (Z-score -1.08), which is conducive to good cardiovascular health and can be associated with good physical conditioning.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data suggest a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 17 minutes (Z-score -1.11), which is below the generally recommended 7-9 hours, and a median sleep start time around 12:49 AM. The standard deviation for sleep duration (120 minutes) and sleep start time (113 minutes) indicates moderate variability in sleep timing and length. Daily naps are minimal (0.07, Z-score -0.08). The relatively low median sleep duration and later sleep onset, along with moderate variability, may indicate areas for improvement in sleep hygiene.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score is not directly provided, but we can infer its likely position within the study population based on the available data.

**Evidence for a low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile - good/average sleep quality):**

*   The participant reports low levels of depression (CES-D Z-score -0.86) and anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.71). These psychological factors are often correlated with poorer sleep quality.
*   Self-esteem is high (Z-score 1.38) and happiness is also high (Z-score 1.64), which are generally associated with better well-being and potentially better sleep.
*   Stress levels are below average (Z-score -0.98).
*   Health satisfaction is relatively high (Z-score 1.22).
*   The wearable data shows a consistent pattern of heart rate decreasing significantly during the early morning hours, indicative of sleep stages. The acrophase at 4:17 PM suggests a typical diurnal rhythm. The low resting heart rate (49.05 bpm) is generally a marker of good cardiovascular health and fitness, which can be linked to better sleep.

**Evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile - poor sleep quality):**

*   The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 17 minutes (Z-score -1.11), which is below the recommended duration for optimal health and performance.
*   The median sleep start time is around 12:49 AM, suggesting a tendency towards late bedtimes, which can disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle.
*   The standard deviations for sleep duration (120 minutes) and sleep start time (113 minutes) indicate moderate variability, implying inconsistency in sleep patterns.

**Holistic Analysis:**

While the participant exhibits several positive psychological and physiological markers that typically correlate with good sleep quality, the objective sleep statistics from the wearable data present a concern. The median sleep duration of approximately 6.2 hours is notably short and could negatively impact overall sleep quality. The late sleep onset time also contributes to this concern. The PSQI assesses multiple domains of sleep quality, including sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction. Given the objectively measured short sleep duration and late sleep onset, it is plausible that these factors would contribute to a PSQI score that reflects poorer sleep quality, placing the participant in the upper half of the distribution. The positive psychological factors may mitigate some of the subjective complaints of poor sleep, but the duration itself is a significant factor.

35987,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral traits that are pertinent to their sleep quality. Psychologically, they report a moderate level of anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.96), falling within the anxious classification, alongside a lower-than-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -1.43). While not experiencing significant depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = -0.34), their lower self-esteem may contribute to an overall psychological state that could impact sleep. Their self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy Z-score = 0.55), suggesting a generally positive disposition despite higher anxiety. Health satisfaction is below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -0.95), and they report average stress levels (Stress Z-score = -0.17).

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a pattern of sedentary leisure activities, with notably high engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.85). Conversely, they report no engagement in exercise, either alone or with others, and do not participate in sports, reflected in very low Z-scores for these activities (-1.93 and -1.58 respectively). Socializing with friends is reported as a limited activity (31 minutes, Z-score = -0.62), and reading and other sedentary hobbies are not undertaken. Regarding substance use, they consume beer 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 1.01), while abstaining from wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, as indicated by Fitbit data, the participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability value of 0.62 (Z-score = 1.74), suggesting a good degree of consistency in their daily physiological cycles. The Intradaily Variability (Z-score = 0.81) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 0.48) also point towards a moderately structured daily rhythm. Their resting heart rate is within the average range (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.11). The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is slightly elevated (Mesor Z-score = 0.56), and the Amplitude of heart rate variation is also on the higher side (Amplitude Z-score = 1.16).

A notable pattern emerges from the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor. There are pronounced dips in heart rate deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM: -23.67, 5-6 AM: -27.28, 6-7 AM: -22.74), indicating a physiological state consistent with deep sleep or prolonged low arousal. Conversely, there are significant positive deviations during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 9-10 PM: 21.01, 10-11 PM: 16.08, 11 PM-12 AM: 18.20, 12-1 AM: 10.25), suggesting periods of heightened physiological activity or difficulty winding down at the end of the day. The Acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is reported at 7:04 PM, which aligns with the observed late evening elevations in heart rate deviation.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes, which is below the study's average, and a standard deviation in sleep duration of 56 minutes, indicating some variability. Their median sleep start time is significantly late at 02:45:29, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is 54 minutes, further suggesting erratic sleep timing. Importantly, there are no reported daily naps. The correlations observed between various metrics and PSQI scores provide context: a positive correlation between CESD and PSQI (0.49) suggests that higher depressive symptoms may be associated with poorer sleep quality, while a negative correlation for Self-Esteem (-0.35) indicates that higher self-esteem is linked to better sleep. Anxiety (STAI) shows a moderate positive correlation (0.4), suggesting higher anxiety is associated with worse sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the analyzed data, there is evidence suggesting a potentially elevated PSQI score, placing the participant in the top 50% of the study population, indicative of poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. Firstly, the participant's median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes is below the average for the study population. Coupled with a significant median sleep start time of 02:45:29 and a considerable standard deviation in sleep start time, this points towards difficulties with sleep onset and overall irregular sleep patterns.

Psychologically, the participant exhibits moderate anxiety and low self-esteem, both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSQI scores in this dataset, suggesting these traits may be contributing to reduced sleep quality. The pattern of physiological arousal in the late evening, as indicated by elevated heart rate deviations from the Mesor between 9 PM and 1 AM, further supports potential difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep. The substantial negative deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours (4-7 AM), while potentially indicating deep sleep, might also reflect an extended period of low physiological activity that is not optimally timed within a consolidated sleep episode.

While the interdaily stability of their circadian rhythm is relatively high, the temporal characteristics of their sleep (late start times, shorter duration) and the psychological factors present a compelling case for poorer sleep quality. Considering these factors collectively, particularly the sleep timing, duration, and the psychological correlates of PSQI, it is probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the upper half of the distribution.

79341,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable pattern of high engagement in physical activity, with frequent exercise sessions reported ""three times a week or more"" when exercising alone, and ""1-2 times a week"" for both exercising with others and participating in sports. This level of physical exertion is above the population average, as indicated by positive Z-scores for these metrics. However, this vigorous activity does not appear to be detrimentally impacting their sleep duration, as their median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes is only slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.51), and the variability in sleep duration is within the population norms. Their sleep start times, however, show some irregularity, with a median start time of 1:50 AM and a standard deviation of 68 minutes, suggesting a potential tendency towards later bedtimes and some variability in sleep onset.

Psychologically, the participant reports relatively low levels of negative affect. Their score on the CES-D scale, which measures depressive symptoms, is below average (Z-score of -0.34), classifying them as not depressed. Similarly, their self-reported happiness is markedly low, indicated by a substantial negative Z-score (-1.61), suggesting a subjective experience of being less happy than the average participant. Despite this, their self-esteem is above average (Z-score of 0.11), and their perceived stress levels are significantly lower than the population average (Z-score of -1.8). Their trust in others is also below the population average (Z-score of -0.46), and their health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.28). These findings present an interesting contrast: a participant who engages in regular physical activity and reports low stress and moderate self-esteem, yet also reports low happiness and a slight deficit in health satisfaction.

The participant's wearable-derived physiological data reveals a generally well-regulated circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.91) and a standard intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.32) in heart rate. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is below the population mean (Z-score of -1.32), indicating a lower overall heart rate level, which is consistent with a relatively low resting heart rate of 48.25 bpm (Z-score of -1.18). The acrophase, or peak of the circadian rhythm, is observed in the late afternoon (4:54 PM), aligning with typical patterns. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a period of elevated physiological arousal in the late morning and early afternoon, particularly between 11 AM and 3 PM, with significant positive deviations. Conversely, the late night and early morning hours, from approximately 2 AM to 6 AM, show the most pronounced negative deviations from the mesor, indicating lower physiological activity during this period, which is expected during sleep. The relatively low nocturnal heart rate deviations, particularly the significant negative values between 2-5 AM, suggest effective physiological downregulation during sleep.

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data provides some insights into their sleep quality. Their low scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.34) and stress (Z-score -1.8), coupled with a moderate level of self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), suggest a generally positive psychological state that is unlikely to be significantly detrimental to sleep quality. The absence of substance usage further supports this. However, their self-reported happiness is notably low (Z-score -1.61), which can sometimes be associated with poorer sleep quality, though the correlation provided is negative (-0.27), indicating that lower happiness is associated with lower PSQI scores in this dataset, which is counterintuitive for poor sleep. Their health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.28).

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits a stable circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 0.91) and a relatively low mesor and resting heart rate, suggestive of good cardiovascular health, which generally correlates with better sleep. The sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is reasonably close to adequate sleep, and the standard deviation for sleep duration is within normal limits. The median sleep start time of 1:50 AM and its standard deviation of 68 minutes suggest some irregularity in sleep timing, which can be a contributing factor to poorer sleep quality. The moderate positive correlation between sleep start time standard deviation and PSQI score (0.18) indicates that greater variability in sleep start times is associated with slightly higher PSQI scores.

Considering the provided PSQI population statistics, the 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. A PSQI score above 6.0 is generally considered to indicate poor sleep quality. While the participant does not have a direct PSQI score provided, we must infer based on the associated metrics. The median sleep duration of 6 hours 46 minutes, while not exceptionally long, is not extremely short. The irregular sleep start time, however, could contribute to a higher PSQI score. The negative correlation of happiness with PSQI (-0.27) is a complex indicator; in this context, it suggests that higher happiness is linked to better sleep (lower PSQI), and thus low happiness could imply worse sleep. Conversely, the low stress and moderate self-esteem are indicators of potentially good sleep.

Given the available data, the irregular sleep start time and the low self-reported happiness are potential indicators for a less than optimal PSQI score. The wearable data does not strongly suggest significantly poor sleep quality (e.g., extremely short duration or high variability), but rather some degree of timing inconsistency. Without a direct PSQI score, a definitive categorization is challenging. However, the presence of factors known to negatively impact sleep quality, such as inconsistent sleep timing and low subjective happiness, pushes the interpretation towards a potentially higher PSQI score. Considering the population's median PSQI is 6.0, and many factors associated with poorer sleep are present to some degree, it is plausible that this participant falls into the upper half of the distribution.

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that may influence sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.97) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.51), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Their self-esteem is within the population average, with a Z-score of 0.4 for a score of 41.0 (where the scale ranges from 10-40, indicating their score is slightly above the maximum possible value, thus indicating very high self-esteem, although the Z-score suggests otherwise relative to the population). Happiness levels are notably high, with a Z-score of 1.64, suggesting they are significantly happier than the average study participant. Conversely, stress levels are close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.17). Health satisfaction is relatively high, with a Z-score of 1.3.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming wine or liquor 1-2 times a month, and beer less than 1-2 times a month. They report not using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is characterized by exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, but not participating in sports. Daily recreational habits reveal a significant engagement with listening to music for over 4 hours, which is substantially higher than the population average (Z-score: 2.06). They spend minimal time watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less) and video games (not at all). Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours), and they report socializing with friends for 2-3 hours, reading for 15 minutes or less, and not engaging in sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a regular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability of 0.41 and Intradaily Variability of 0.65 suggest a moderate level of rhythmicity. The Mesor (average heart rate) is 74.23 bpm, which is close to the population average (Z-score: 0.04), and the Amplitude of 10.55 is also near the average. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is observed at 5:12 PM. Resting heart rate is within the lower end of the population distribution (Z-score: -0.21), suggesting a relatively healthy cardiovascular state. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor shows a pattern consistent with typical daily activity. Notably, significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate relative to the Mesor, occur during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -14.57, 4-5 AM: -20.41, 5-6 AM: -22.99, 6-7 AM: -23.37). Positive deviations, suggesting higher than average heart rate, are observed in the afternoon and evening (e.g., 12-1 PM: 14.39, 6-7 PM: 14.26, 7-8 PM: 14.46, 9-10 PM: 11.29).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.13). The standard deviation for sleep duration is 84 minutes, suggesting moderate variability in sleep length (Z-score: -0.39). The median sleep start time is notably late at 2:25 AM, with a standard deviation of 99 minutes, indicating significant variability in sleep onset (Z-score: 0.35). The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86). The correlations between various metrics and the PSQI score, while provided, do not strongly indicate a clear direction of impact for most variables, with a few exceptions. For instance, a positive correlation exists between stress and PSQI score (0.2), and between late night/early morning heart rate deviations and PSQI score (e.g., 2-3 AM: 0.2, 3-4 AM: 0.23). Conversely, higher self-esteem and happiness show weak negative correlations with PSQI score (-0.35 and -0.27 respectively), suggesting better sleep quality with higher self-esteem and happiness.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The PSQI population data indicates a median score of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A score of 6.0 or lower generally represents better or average sleep quality (bottom 50th percentile), while scores above 6.0 indicate poorer sleep quality (top 50th percentile).

Evidence for a **low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile)** includes the participant's low reported stress (Z-score: -0.17), low anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.51), and a healthy resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.21). Their health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z-score: 1.3). While their sleep duration is average, the significant variability in sleep start time (Z-score: 0.35) is a potential concern, but not definitively indicative of poor sleep quality on its own. The positive correlations between stress and PSQI score (0.2) and certain late-night/early-morning heart rate deviations and PSQI score (e.g., 3-4 AM: 0.23) suggest that if stress and disrupted early sleep physiology were present, they might contribute to poorer sleep, but the current levels of stress and these physiological markers do not appear extreme.

Evidence for a **high PSQI score (top 50th percentile)** includes the late median sleep start time (2:25 AM) and its considerable standard deviation (99 minutes), suggesting a disorganized sleep schedule. The significant time spent listening to music (over 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06) could be a factor if it replaces sleep or contributes to difficulties winding down. Furthermore, while general depression and anxiety are low, the positive correlation of stress with PSQI (0.2) indicates stress could be a contributing factor to poorer sleep quality, even if overall stress levels are not high. The positive correlation of certain late-night heart rate deviations with PSQI (e.g., 2-3 AM: 0.2, 3-4 AM: 0.23) suggests that physiological arousal during these times may be linked to worse sleep.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents with generally positive psychological indicators like low anxiety and depression, and high happiness and self-esteem, which typically correlate with better sleep. Their physiological markers, such as Mesor and resting heart rate, are within normal ranges, and their circadian rhythm shows moderate stability. However, the extremely late and variable sleep start time is a significant indicator of potential sleep disruption. While the median sleep duration is adequate, the timing and consistency of sleep are crucial for quality. The positive correlations between stress and PSQI, and some specific deviations in heart rate during the early morning with PSQI, suggest that even moderate levels of stress or physiological dysregulation during critical sleep periods could negatively impact their overall sleep quality. Given the strong indicator of a disorganized sleep schedule (late and variable sleep onset) and the presence of factors with positive correlations to PSQI, it is more likely that this participant falls into the **top 50th percentile** for PSQI scores, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality.

This participant exhibits several notable characteristics across self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological data. In terms of psychological well-being, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 1.0, Z-score -1.28) and anxiety (STAI score of 26.0, Z-score -1.51), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 45.0, Z-score 0.96), and reported happiness is significantly above average (Current happiness score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64). Notably, stress levels are within the population average (Stress score of 21.0, Z-score -0.17). Trust in others is also slightly above average (Trust score of 3.5, Z-score 0.5), and general health satisfaction is also slightly elevated (Health Satisfaction score of 4.56, Z-score 0.22). Academically, the participant demonstrates a strong performance with GPAs consistently at or near 4.0.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant consumes alcoholic beverages (beer and wine/liquor) 1-2 times per week, which is above average (Beer Z-score 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score 0.94). However, they report no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are relatively high, with exercise occurring alone three times a week or more (Exercised Alone frequency Z-score 1.07) and sports participation 1-2 times a week (Sports frequency Z-score 0.91). Exercise with others is less frequent, occurring 1-2 times a month (Exercised with Others frequency Z-score -0.17). Daily recreational habits indicate limited engagement with passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, both reported as ""Do not do"" (Watching TV/Videos/Movies Z-score -1.25, Video Games Z-score -0.56). Internet usage is reported as 1-2 hours (Z-score 0.18), and listening to music for 15 minutes or less (Z-score -0.72). Socializing with friends is notably low, with reported time of 15 minutes or less (Z-score -2.2), and reading and other sedentary hobbies are also reported as ""Do not do"" (Reading Z-score -0.67, Sedentary Hobby Z-score -0.96).

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by a moderate interdaily stability of 0.48 (Z-score 0.58) and a high intradaily variability of 0.77 (Z-score 1.58), suggesting consistent daily patterns but with notable fluctuations within the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below population average at 68.25 bpm (Z-score -0.78), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is also slightly below average at 10.18 bpm (Z-score -0.19). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs at 4:08 PM. The resting heart rate is below average at 53.6 bpm (Z-score -0.54). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates distinct patterns. There are significant dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score -1.72; 2-3 AM, Z-score -1.68; 3-4 AM, Z-score -0.61; 4-5 AM, Z-score -0.66; 5-6 AM, Z-score -0.27; 6-7 AM, Z-score -1.02), consistent with sleep. Conversely, increased heart rate deviations are observed during late morning (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score 1.48; 9-10 AM, Z-score 0.78; 10-11 AM, Z-score 1.36; 11 AM-12 PM, Z-score 0.94) and late evening (e.g., 8-9 PM, Z-score 2.32; 10-11 PM, Z-score 1.49), reflecting periods of heightened activity or arousal.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score 0.02), which is very close to the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 58 minutes (Z-score -0.98), suggesting relatively consistent sleep durations on a nightly basis. The median sleep start time is around 1:14 AM (Z-score not provided, but standard deviation of 26 minutes, Z-score -1.24, suggests regularity in sleep onset time). The mean number of daily naps is 0.12 (Z-score 0.61), indicating infrequent napping.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we will consider the available data in relation to the population distribution of PSQI scores. The population mean PSQI score is 6.72, with a median of 6.0, and the 75th percentile at 8.0. This indicates that a PSQI score of 6 or below generally represents good to average sleep quality (bottom 50th percentile), while a score above 6 suggests potentially poorer sleep quality (top 50th percentile).

The participant's self-reported psychological profile is largely positive, with low reported depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness. These factors are often associated with better sleep quality. Furthermore, their sleep duration is close to average, and their sleep start times are relatively consistent. The low frequency of naps and the observed physiological patterns of heart rate during sleep (significant dips in the early morning hours) also suggest a potentially healthy sleep architecture. The moderate interdaily stability and high intradaily variability of heart rate, coupled with the regular acrophase, point towards a structured circadian rhythm.

While the participant reports higher-than-average alcohol consumption and limited social interaction, the available data does not strongly indicate these as detrimental to their sleep quality in a way that would place them in the top 50% of PSQI scores. The correlations provided, although not the sole basis for this assessment, generally show weak to moderate positive correlations between factors potentially associated with poorer sleep (e.g., stress) and PSQI score, and weak to moderate negative correlations between factors associated with better sleep (e.g., self-esteem, happiness) and PSQI score. These correlations do not strongly suggest a high PSQI score.

Considering the overall picture, the participant's positive psychological state, consistent sleep duration and onset, and evidence of a structured circadian rhythm, along with the absence of strong indicators of poor sleep, suggest that their PSQI score is likely within the lower half of the distribution.

19735,6.0,0.387434554973822,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Notably, elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 34.0, Z-score 2.15) are present, which are positively correlated with PSQI score (0.5). This indicates a potential vulnerability to poorer sleep quality stemming from a higher burden of depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI score of 47.0, Z-score 0.56) is also moderately elevated and shows a positive correlation with PSQI score (0.4), suggesting that a disposition towards anxiety may also contribute to sleep disturbances. Conversely, self-esteem is below average (Score of 31.0, Z-Score -1.01), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.36) to PSQI, implying that higher self-esteem might be associated with better sleep. Trust in others is also lower than the study average (Score of 2.67, Z-Score -1.1), with a slight negative correlation (-0.21) to PSQI. Happiness levels are also somewhat lower than average (Current Happiness Z-Score -0.53), showing a negative correlation (-0.27) with PSQI. Stress levels are not significantly elevated (Score of 19.0, Z-Score -0.71) and show a small positive correlation (0.2) with PSQI. Overall health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score of 3.67, Z-score -0.45) with a negative correlation (-0.21) to PSQI.

Behavioral habits reveal a moderate pattern of substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, and recreational drugs 1-2 times per month. These frequencies are above the study average, as indicated by their positive Z-scores (1.01 for Beer, 0.94 for Wine or Liquor, and 3.52 for Recreational Drugs). However, the correlations of these substance use frequencies with PSQI are relatively low, suggesting they may not be the primary drivers of sleep quality. Physical activity is primarily characterized by exercising alone 1-2 times a week, while exercising with others and participation in sports are infrequent. Daily recreation habits show very low engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music, with minimal internet usage and socializing with friends. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for 15-30 minutes. The low engagement in social activities and media consumption might reflect an attempt to limit screen time or social interaction, but the correlations with PSQI are generally weak, with the exception of a slight negative correlation for socializing with friends (-0.06).

Physiological data from the wearable device suggest a regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a relatively stable interdaily stability (Value 0.42, Z-Score 0.09) and moderate intradaily variability (Value 0.51, Z-Score -0.25). The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above average (Value 75.1, Z-Score 0.16), while the amplitude is notably higher than the population mean (Value 14.29, Z-Score 1.13), suggesting a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is recorded at 5:26 PM. Resting heart rate is lower than average (Value 50.3, Z-Score -0.93). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates a pattern of reduced heart rate during the typical sleep period (e.g., significant negative deviations between 3-8 AM, with the most pronounced at 4-5 AM with -25.59). Conversely, heart rate tends to be elevated during the late afternoon and early evening, peaking between 5-6 PM with a deviation of 15.67. This pattern is consistent with a typical diurnal heart rate rhythm, but the pronounced dip in heart rate during early morning hours may reflect deep sleep or a longer period of reduced physiological arousal.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes, which is longer than average (Z-Score 0.77), and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (112 minutes, Z-Score 0.25), suggesting consistency in sleep duration. However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:01:45 AM, with a standard deviation of 77 minutes, indicating variability in sleep timing. The late sleep onset time, despite a generally adequate duration and consistency, is a key factor that could contribute to poorer sleep quality and be associated with a higher PSQI score. The low frequency of daily naps (0.08, Z-Score 0.04) suggests that sleepiness during the day is not a prominent issue, or is managed effectively.

Considering the significant elevation in depressive symptoms and moderate trait anxiety, coupled with a late sleep start time, these factors are likely to contribute to a higher PSQI score. While sleep duration is adequate and consistent, and physiological rhythms are generally regular, the psychological distress and sleep timing are strong indicators for potentially poorer sleep quality. The positive correlations of CES-D and STAI scores with PSQI, and the late sleep onset time, are the most salient indicators of potential sleep disturbances.

59207,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally healthy lifestyle behaviors and moderate psychological well-being, which may contribute to their sleep patterns. Their CES-D score is indicative of no significant depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score suggests a low level of chronic anxiety. While their self-esteem is above average (Z-score of 0.68), their reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53). The participant also reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score of 1.3). In terms of substance usage, they consume beer 1-2 times a week, which is a relatively higher frequency compared to the population (Z-score of 1.01), but wine/liquor and drug use are infrequent. Exercise habits are robust, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07) and exercising with others and participation in sports occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreation includes substantial time spent on video games (1-2 hours, Z-score of 2.47) and moderate internet usage (2-3 hours), with less time dedicated to watching TV/videos/movies. Socializing with friends and reading are minimal.

The wearable data provides further insight into their physiological rhythms and activity levels. The participant demonstrates a high degree of interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.24), suggesting a consistent daily routine. Conversely, their intradaily variability is notably low (Z-score of -2.08), indicating a less dynamic heart rate fluctuation throughout the day, which may reflect a more sedentary or consistent physiological state. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Z-score of 0.34), and the amplitude of their circadian rhythm is also higher than average (Z-score of 1.05), suggesting a greater daily swing in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak of their circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:58 PM). Their resting heart rate is within the population average (Z-score of 0.39). Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals the lowest deviations during the early morning hours (3-7 AM), with significant negative deviations (indicating heart rate below the mesor) during this period. Heart rate begins to increase from the morning, with notable positive deviations (heart rate above the mesor) observed in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 6 PM and 11 PM.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 13 minutes, which is longer than the population average (Z-score of 1.28). However, the standard deviation of their sleep duration is also quite high (Z-score of 1.55), suggesting considerable variability in how long they sleep each night. Their median sleep start time is late (1:34 AM), and the standard deviation of their sleep start times is also high (Z-score of 1.27), indicating inconsistent sleep timing. The absence of reported daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) aligns with a generally consistent sleep pattern, despite the variability in duration and start time.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture concerning their sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI. On the positive side, their psychological profile is generally favorable. They report low levels of depression and anxiety, and while their self-esteem is above average, their overall happiness is slightly below average. Their high satisfaction with physical health is also a positive indicator. In terms of behaviors, they engage in regular exercise, which is generally associated with better sleep.

However, several factors suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality. The high standard deviation in sleep duration and sleep start time, along with a late median sleep start time, points to significant irregularity in their sleep schedule. This inconsistency can negatively impact sleep quality. While their average sleep duration is above the population norm, this might be a compensatory behavior for disrupted sleep. The wearable data also shows a relatively consistent heart rate throughout the day (low intradaily variability), which could, in some individuals, be associated with less restorative sleep. The moderate alcohol consumption (beer 1-2 times a week) could also play a role, though its correlation with PSQI is low.

The PSQI population mean is 6.72, with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A higher PSQI score indicates poorer sleep quality. The participant's substantial sleep schedule variability, late sleep onset, and potential for fragmented sleep due to this irregularity are key indicators of potential sleep issues. Although they have many positive attributes, the inconsistency in their sleep patterns is a significant concern for PSQI scores. Given the strong association between sleep regularity and sleep quality, and the observed variability in the participant's sleep start times and durations, it is likely that their PSQI score would fall in the upper half of the distribution, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality.

96613,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, lifestyle habits, and physiological patterns that inform their sleep quality. Self-reported measures suggest a generally positive psychological state, with low scores on the CES-D (indicating no significant depressive symptoms) and STAI-Trait (indicating low chronic anxiety). Their self-esteem score is relatively high (Z-score of 0.96), suggesting a strong sense of self-worth, and they report a moderate level of happiness (Z-score of -0.53). Trust in others is also present at a moderate level (Z-score of 0.5). However, a notable finding is a higher-than-average stress score (Z-score of 0.1), which may indicate a contributing factor to sleep disruption.

Lifestyle behaviors reveal a mixed pattern. The participant reports regular engagement in social drinking (beer 1-2 times a week), but infrequent consumption of wine/liquor and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity patterns show a dichotomy: no engagement in exercising alone (Z-score of -1.93, indicating very low frequency) but significant engagement in exercising with others (Z-score of 1.23) and participating in sports (Z-score of 0.91), suggesting a preference for social or team-based physical activities. Daily recreational habits indicate substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.64) and playing video games (Z-score of 0.96), alongside moderate internet usage (Z-score of -0.49) and less time spent listening to music or reading. A high score for sedentary hobbies (Z-score of 1.41) suggests a considerable amount of time spent in less active pursuits.

Physiological data from the wearable provides insight into daily rhythms and cardiovascular activity. The participant's resting heart rate is notably low (47.8 bpm, Z-score of -1.23), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of 67.61 bpm (Z-score of -0.86) is also relatively low, aligning with a lower resting heart rate. The amplitude of 14.68 bpm (Z-score of 1.26) indicates a substantial daily fluctuation in heart rate, suggesting periods of both high and low cardiovascular activity. The acrophase occurring at 5:26 PM points to the peak in heart rate occurring in the late afternoon.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveals distinct patterns. The most significant negative deviations (indicating lower heart rate than expected) occur in the early morning hours (3-7 AM), with values as low as -26.65 bpm. Conversely, the largest positive deviations (indicating higher heart rate) are observed in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 2-4 PM (up to +20.09 bpm) and again from 8-10 PM (up to +18.08 bpm). These patterns suggest a typical circadian rhythm where heart rate decreases during sleep and increases during waking hours, with notable peaks in the late afternoon and early evening. The intraday variability (Z-score of 0.67) is higher than average, indicating less stable heart rate patterns throughout the day. The interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.33) is also slightly above average, suggesting some regularity in daily rhythm, though not exceptionally high.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally healthy sleep duration, with a median duration of 8 hours and 29 minutes (Z-score of 1.61), which is significantly longer than the population mean. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is within average range, suggesting some variability. The median sleep start time is quite late, at 1:31 AM, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is also on the lower side, indicating some consistency in this late bedtime. The mean daily nap frequency is slightly above average.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a nuanced picture regarding their sleep quality, making a definitive placement within the PSQI distribution challenging without the direct PSQI score. However, we can infer based on contributing factors and correlations.

Evidence for a **low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality)** can be inferred from several indicators. The participant reports a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, and high self-esteem, all of which are generally associated with better sleep quality. Their self-reported happiness is moderate. Notably, the median sleep duration is exceptionally long (8 hours 29 minutes), a strong indicator of good sleep. Their resting heart rate is also low, suggesting good physical health which often correlates with better sleep.

Conversely, evidence for a **high PSQI score (top 50th percentile, indicating relatively poor sleep quality)** is also present. The participant reports a higher-than-average stress level (Z-score of 0.1), which is a known detractor from sleep quality. Their late median sleep start time (1:31 AM) suggests a delayed sleep phase, which can contribute to disruptions. While their sleep duration is long, the consistency of this duration might be compromised by the late start time. The substantial positive deviations in heart rate during the late afternoon and evening (up to +20.09 bpm and +18.08 bpm) could indicate heightened physiological arousal during these periods, potentially interfering with sleep onset. Furthermore, significant time spent on sedentary hobbies, watching TV, and playing video games may displace other activities and contribute to a less regulated lifestyle that can negatively impact sleep. The positive correlation between stress and PSQI score (0.2) further supports this possibility.

**Holistic Analysis:**

Despite the positive indicators such as long sleep duration and low resting heart rate, the presence of elevated stress levels, a significantly late sleep start time, and potentially disruptive evening physiological arousal patterns (as indicated by heart rate deviations) suggest a greater likelihood of sleep disturbance. The positive correlation between stress and PSQI, though moderate, further supports this. While the sleep duration is excellent, the timing and consistency of sleep onset may be compromised. Therefore, it is plausible that the participant’s overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, would place them in the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality compared to the average.

The participant exhibits a generally stable psychological profile characterized by low levels of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score -0.43). Self-esteem is slightly above average for the population (SelfEsteem score of 43.0, Z-Score 0.68), and trust in others is slightly below average (Trust score of 3.0, Z-Score -0.46). Happiness levels are also slightly lower than the population average (Happy score of 3.0, Z-Score -0.53). Notably, stress levels are relatively low (Stress score of 19.0, Z-Score -0.71). Health satisfaction is high (Health Satisfaction score of 5.56, Z-score 0.97), and the participant maintains a healthy BMI.

Behaviorally, the participant's substance usage aligns with lower frequency patterns, with Beer consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-Score 1.01) and Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a month (Z-Score 0.19). Recreational drugs are used less than 1-2 times a month (Z-Score 1.61), and non-prescribed drugs are not used at all (Z-Score -0.11). Exercise habits are mixed; while the participant exercises alone less frequently than 1-2 times a month (Z-Score -1.18), they engage in exercise with others three times a week or more (Z-Score 1.23) and participate in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-Score 0.91). Daily recreational activities show moderate engagement with watching TV/videos/movies for 16-30 minutes (Z-Score 0.01) and internet usage for a similar duration (Z-Score -1.16). Other sedentary activities like listening to music, video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for less than 15 minutes or not at all. Notably, socializing with friends is limited to 15 minutes or less (Z-Score -2.2), suggesting a potential area of lower social engagement.

Physiologically, as assessed by wearable data, the participant exhibits strong circadian rhythmicity. Interdaily Stability (Value 0.58, Z-Score 1.41) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value 0.51, Z-Score 1.57) are notably high, indicating a regular daily pattern in heart rate. Intradaily Variability (Value 0.38, Z-Score -1.16) is relatively low, suggesting a smooth daily heart rate fluctuation. The Mesor (Value 78.81, Z-Score 0.66) is slightly elevated, and the Amplitude (Value 15.81, Z-Score 1.63) is significantly high, indicating a pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 5:23 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is average (Value 58.1, Z-Score -0.01). Analysis of hourly deviations from the Mesor reveals that the participant's heart rate is generally lower than expected during nighttime and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, -20.91 deviation), consistent with sleep. Conversely, there are notable periods of elevated heart rate during the afternoon and evening (e.g., 3-4 PM, 23.21 deviation; 6-7 PM, 20.77 deviation; 7-8 PM, 19.27 deviation), which aligns with typical daily activity patterns and potential physiological responses to the day's events.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 29 minutes (Z-Score 0.37), which is slightly above average. The variability in sleep duration is also average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Value 100 minutes, Z-Score -0.03). The median sleep start time is late at 1:27 AM, with a moderate standard deviation of 54 minutes (Z-Score -0.63), suggesting some consistency in the late sleep schedule. Napping frequency is slightly above average (Mean Daily Naps Value 0.12, Z-Score 0.61).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score is not directly provided in the data. However, the provided information can be analyzed to infer their likely position within the study population's PSQI distribution. The population PSQI has a mean of 6.72 and a 50th percentile of 6.0. A PSQI score below 6.0 generally indicates good sleep quality, while scores above 6.0 suggest poorer sleep quality.

Several factors in the participant's data suggest a potentially favorable sleep quality, which would place them in the bottom 50th percentile. Their psychological profile is characterized by low reported depression and anxiety, moderate-to-high self-esteem, and relatively low stress levels, all of which are generally associated with better sleep. Their health satisfaction is high, and their BMI is within a healthy range. While their sleep start time is late (median 1:27 AM), their median sleep duration (7 hours 29 minutes) is sufficient and slightly above average. The moderate standard deviation in sleep start time suggests some regularity. The observed physiological data supports a robust circadian rhythm, with lower heart rate deviations during typical sleep hours and a pronounced but regular daily variation.

Conversely, a few factors might slightly elevate their PSQI score. Their limited socializing time with friends could indicate a potential area of unmet social needs, which can sometimes impact sleep quality. The moderate standard deviation in sleep start time suggests that while not extremely erratic, their sleep schedule does have some variability. The frequency of naps is also slightly above average.

However, weighing the evidence, the strong indicators of positive psychological well-being, sufficient sleep duration, and robust circadian rhythmicity suggest that the participant likely experiences relatively good or average sleep quality. These factors are generally strong predictors of lower PSQI scores. The absence of significant self-reported sleep disturbances (e.g., high scores on subjective sleep quality, latency, or disturbance indices, which are not explicitly provided but inferred from the overall psychological profile) further supports this.

Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's PSQI score falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population, indicating better to average sleep quality.

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that inform their sleep quality. Psychologically, the data indicates moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16.0, Z-score 0.28) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 46.0, Z-score 0.46). Conversely, self-esteem is notably low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 27.0, Z-score -1.57), alongside lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Score of 2.33, Z-score -1.45). Stress levels are within the population norm (Score of 19.0, Z-score -0.71). Substance usage, including beer and wine/liquor, occurs infrequently (1-2 times a month), with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is notably absent, with no self-reported frequency of exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, reflected in very low Z-scores for these activities. Daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary pursuits, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and extensive internet and music listening, which are higher than the population average. Socializing with friends and reading are less frequent.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively high resting heart rate (Value of 71.2 bpm, Z-score 1.55), indicative of elevated baseline physiological arousal. The mesor, a measure of central tendency for heart rate, is also significantly elevated (Value of 86.93, Z-score 1.77), suggesting a generally higher average heart rate throughout the day. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a moderate interdaily stability (Value of 0.57, Z-score 1.33) and intradaily variability (Value of 0.43, Z-score -0.81), suggesting a somewhat regular, but not highly rigid, daily pattern in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:34 PM). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., -16.59 at 3-4 AM), potentially reflecting periods of reduced physiological activity during the expected sleep period. Conversely, heart rate tends to increase during the day, with notable peaks in the evening (e.g., 15.85 at 7-8 PM).

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a generally long sleep duration, with a median of 8 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score 1.26), and relatively consistent sleep durations day-to-day (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation of 63 minutes, Z-score -0.85). However, the median sleep start time is quite late at 00:50:30, with moderate variability in sleep start times across nights (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation of 39 minutes, Z-score -0.96). There are no reported daily naps. The overall correlation patterns suggest that higher depressive symptoms and anxiety are weakly associated with poorer sleep quality, while lower self-esteem and health satisfaction show a moderate negative correlation, implying better sleep quality with higher levels of these traits. Lower stress levels and higher trust in others are also weakly associated with better sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality. On the positive side, the participant reports a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 12 minutes), which is above the population average. Furthermore, the sleep duration itself appears to be consistent from night to night, as indicated by a standard deviation of 63 minutes. The absence of daily naps also suggests an effort to consolidate sleep.

However, several factors suggest potential sleep difficulties. The median sleep start time is significantly late (00:50:30), and while the variability in sleep start times is not excessively high, it indicates a tendency towards delayed sleep onset. Psychologically, the participant exhibits moderate levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are known correlates of poor sleep quality. While the correlations provided are not universally strong, the positive correlation between CES-D and PSQI (0.49) and STAI and PSQI (0.4) are notable. Furthermore, low self-esteem and low health satisfaction, with negative correlations to PSQI, suggest that improvements in these areas might be associated with better sleep. The sedentary lifestyle, characterized by minimal exercise and significant time spent on screen-based activities, can also negatively impact sleep. The elevated resting heart rate and mesor suggest a state of higher physiological arousal that may interfere with sleep initiation and maintenance.

Considering the population's PSQI distribution with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, a score above 6 would place an individual in the top 50% of poor sleepers. Given the presence of moderate psychological distress (depression and anxiety), a very late sleep onset, and physiological indicators of heightened arousal, it is plausible that this participant's PSQI score leans towards the higher end of the distribution. The positive correlations of depressive symptoms and anxiety with PSQI further support this. Therefore, despite the long sleep duration, the other contributing factors likely elevate their PSQI score, placing them in the upper half of the study population regarding sleep quality.

The participant exhibits a high level of academic achievement, as indicated by consistently high GPAs (ranging from 3.89 to 3.94). Their psychological profile suggests a generally positive disposition, with low scores on measures of depression (CES-D, Z-score -0.86) and anxiety (STAI, Z-score -1.41). Self-esteem is notably high (RSES, Z-score 1.1), and the participant reports high levels of happiness (Z-score 1.64). Despite these positive self-assessments, stress levels are slightly elevated (Z-score 0.38), though this does not strongly correlate with PSQI score. Physical health satisfaction is also reported as high (Z-score 1.22).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, while abstaining from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are mixed; there is no reported frequency of exercising alone (Z-score -1.93), but the participant exercises with others three times a week or more (Z-score 1.23). Participation in sports is infrequent. Daily recreational activities are varied, with a noted absence of watching TV/videos/movies and reading, and a moderate engagement in video games (16-30 minutes). Socializing with friends and internet usage occupy approximately 31 minutes to an hour daily.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is within the typical range (Value: 60.4, Z-score 0.27). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable pattern, with moderate intradaily variability (Value: 0.29, Z-score -1.8) and interdaily stability (Value: 0.27, Z-score -1.15), suggesting a somewhat regular daily rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle) is near population average (Value: 73.88, Z-score -0.01). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs around 4:14 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate expected diurnal variations, with lower deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-5 AM show significant negative deviations) and increasing positive deviations throughout the morning and afternoon, peaking around 1-3 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score 1.05), which is above the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is moderate (78 minutes), suggesting some variability. The median sleep start time is late, around 12:33 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (47 minutes), implying some inconsistency in bedtime. No daily naps were recorded.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we will consider the available data in relation to the population PSQI distribution. The population PSQI mean is 6.73, with a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score below 6.0 would place the participant in the bottom 50% (good/average sleep quality), while a score above 8.0 would place them in the top 50% (poor sleep quality). Scores between 6.0 and 8.0 fall around the median.

Evidence supporting a potentially lower PSQI score (bottom 50%):
*   **Long Median Sleep Duration:** The participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 2 minutes, which is a positive indicator of sleep quantity. The Z-score of 1.05 suggests this is above average for the study population.
*   **Low Depression and Anxiety Scores:** The participant's low scores on CES-D and STAI indicate a lack of significant depressive and anxious symptoms, which are often associated with poor sleep quality.
*   **High Self-Esteem and Happiness:** High self-esteem and happiness are generally conducive to better sleep.
*   **Moderate Intradaily Variability and Interdaily Stability:** While not exceptionally high, the participant's wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics do not suggest extreme dysregulation, which could contribute to poor sleep.

Evidence supporting a potentially higher PSQI score (top 50%):
*   **Late Median Sleep Start Time:** A median sleep start time of 00:33:42 is considerably late. While the standard deviation is moderate, a consistently late bedtime can disrupt sleep schedules and quality.
*   **Moderate Sleep Duration Variability:** The 78-minute standard deviation in sleep duration suggests that while the median is long, there can be significant variation from night to night, which can negatively impact sleep quality.
*   **Positive Correlation between Stress and PSQI:** The stress score has a positive correlation (0.2) with the PSQI score, and this participant's stress is slightly elevated.
*   **Positive Correlation between Depression and PSQI:** While not depressed, the CES-D score has a correlation of 0.49 with PSQI. Even a score indicating ""not depressed"" could contribute to poorer sleep if it's on the higher end of that range.

Holistic analysis:
The participant exhibits several positive indicators for sleep quality, including long sleep duration, low levels of depression and anxiety, and good self-reported happiness and self-esteem. However, the late sleep start time and the moderate variability in sleep duration are potential detriments. Considering the population data, a PSQI score of 6.0 is the median. The positive indicators of long sleep duration and psychological well-being would likely mitigate the impact of a late bedtime, suggesting that their overall sleep quality is not significantly impaired to the degree that would place them in the top 50% (poor sleep). The relatively good sleep quantity and absence of overt psychological distress lean towards a PSQI score that falls within the average or better range.

38815,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents a mixed profile regarding psychological traits and behavioral patterns, with some indicators suggesting potential areas of concern that may indirectly influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate level of anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17) and a tendency towards moderate stress levels (Stress Z-score: 0.1). Conversely, the participant reports being not depressed (CESD Z-score: -0.24) and exhibits relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.03), and moderate happiness (Happy Z-score: 0.55). Their trust in others is notably low (Trust Z-score: -1.42), which could reflect underlying social or interpersonal factors. Health satisfaction is relatively high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.05), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (Beer Z-score: 1.01), which is higher than the population average. Exercise habits indicate regular solitary exercise (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07), but less frequent exercise with others. Daily recreation is dominated by significant internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score: 1.52) and considerable time spent listening to music (Listening to Music Z-score: 1.13), while other sedentary activities like watching TV and reading are minimal.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.27), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is also below the population average (Mesor Z-score: -1.1). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a distinct pattern of physiological arousal, with marked deviations from the mesor occurring during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 4-5 PM Z-score: 2.06, 6-7 PM Z-score: 1.65). This suggests a period of heightened cardiovascular activity during these times. Conversely, during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: -17.71, 4-5 AM Z-score: -20.95, 5-6 AM Z-score: -22.45), the heart rate is significantly lower than the mesor, indicating a period of reduced physiological activity, likely corresponding with sleep. The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:55 PM), aligning with the observed elevated heart rate deviations.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration that is close to the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.16), though the variability in sleep duration is higher than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.8). The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:49:59), with moderate variability in sleep start times. The frequency of daily naps is slightly above average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.61). Circadian rhythm metrics show low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.82), suggesting less regularity in daily routines and physiological patterns, and moderate intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.56).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group (top 50% or bottom 50% of the study population), we will consider the available data in relation to sleep quality. The population PSQI has a mean of 6.72, with a 50th percentile of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A higher PSQI score indicates poorer sleep quality.

Several factors in the participant's data might contribute to a higher PSQI score (top 50%):

*   **Moderate Anxiety and Stress:** While not reaching clinical depression, the reported moderate levels of anxiety and stress can negatively impact sleep quality by increasing arousal and making it difficult to fall or stay asleep. The positive correlation between Stress score and PSQI (0.2) supports this, although it is a moderate correlation.
*   **Higher Substance Usage:** Frequent beer consumption (1-2 times a week) can disrupt sleep architecture and lead to poorer sleep quality, even if the correlation with PSQI is very low (0.03).
*   **Higher Internet Usage and Listening to Music:** Significant time spent on internet usage and listening to music, especially if done close to bedtime, can be stimulating and interfere with sleep onset and quality. The positive correlations with PSQI (0.12 for internet, 0.12 for music) are consistent with this.
*   **Higher Sleep Duration Variability:** A higher standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: 0.8) suggests inconsistency in sleep patterns, which is often associated with poorer sleep quality. The correlation with PSQI (0.2) further supports this.
*   **Lower Interdaily Stability:** Low interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.82) indicates a lack of regularity in daily activity patterns, which can be a marker of poor circadian alignment and consequently, poorer sleep. The negative correlation with PSQI (-0.07) is slightly counterintuitive if we assume poor stability always leads to bad sleep, but it could reflect that *very* rigid schedules might also be detrimental in some contexts. However, generally, low stability is not conducive to good sleep.
*   **Higher Mean Daily Naps:** An increased frequency of naps (Z-score: 0.61) can sometimes indicate underlying sleep deprivation or poor nocturnal sleep quality, and often correlates with higher PSQI scores (0.17).

Factors that might contribute to a lower PSQI score (bottom 50%) include:

*   **Good Self-Esteem and Low Depression:** High self-esteem and low depressive symptoms are generally associated with better psychological well-being and can positively influence sleep.
*   **High Health Satisfaction:** A positive outlook on physical health can be associated with better sleep. The negative correlation with PSQI (-0.21) supports this.
*   **Lower Resting Heart Rate:** A lower resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.27) generally indicates good cardiovascular health and can be associated with better sleep, though the direct correlation with PSQI is moderate (0.12).
*   **Median Sleep Duration Close to Average:** The median sleep duration being close to the population average, with a small negative Z-score, suggests the participant is getting a reasonable amount of sleep on average.

Considering the overall picture, the factors suggesting poorer sleep quality (moderate anxiety, stress, higher internet and music usage, high sleep duration variability, and low interdaily stability) appear to carry more weight in their potential impact on PSQI. While some positive indicators are present, the behavioral and physiological patterns point towards a higher likelihood of experiencing some sleep disturbances. Given the population parameters (75th percentile at 8.0, 50th at 6.0), and the constellation of risk factors, it is plausible that this participant's PSQI score falls in the upper half of the distribution.

72885,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their sleep quality. Self-reported data indicates moderate levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.46) and slightly below-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -1.01). While not clinically depressed, they report a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = 0.18). Their reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy Z-score = 0.55). Notably, their trust in others is relatively low (Trust Z-score = -1.42), and their satisfaction with their physical health is also below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in recreational drug use with a high Z-score (5.44), suggesting this is significantly above the population average. Their consumption of beer and wine/liquor is within the typical range (Z-scores of 0.3 and 0.19 respectively). Physical activity levels are low, with infrequent solitary exercise (Exercised Alone Frequency Z-score = -0.43) and no reported exercise with others or participation in sports (Exercised with Others Frequency Z-score = -1.58; Sports Frequency Z-score = -1.09). Daily leisure activities are dominated by screen time, with moderate to high engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 0.01) and significant time spent playing video games (Z-score = 2.47), as well as internet usage (Z-score = 0.18). Socializing with friends occurs less than an hour per day (Z-score = -0.62), and reading is minimal (Z-score = 0.32).

Wearable data reveals notable patterns in circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The interdaily stability of their heart rate is low (Interdaily Stability Z-score = -1.32), indicating less regularity in daily physiological rhythms. Their intradaily variability, however, is within the average range (Intradaily Variability Z-score = -0.18). The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is below average (Mesor Z-score = -0.74), aligning with a below-average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -0.45). The amplitude of their circadian rhythm is also below average (Amplitude Z-score = -1.0), suggesting less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, is reported as 6:38 PM, which is within the typical afternoon/early evening range.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor highlights distinct physiological patterns. There are significant positive deviations during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 3-4 PM: 11.23, 4-5 PM: 11.48), suggesting increased physiological arousal during this period. Conversely, profound negative deviations are observed in the early morning hours, particularly between 4 AM and 7 AM (e.g., 4-5 AM: -11.28, 5-6 AM: -16.76, 6-7 AM: -17.1), indicating a substantial dip in heart rate during these times, which may align with deep sleep stages or a delayed sleep phase. The period between 1 AM and 3 AM also shows elevated positive deviations (e.g., 1-2 AM: 6.66, 2-3 AM: -1.82), which might reflect periods of wakefulness or lighter sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a considerably short median sleep duration of 5 hours and 59 minutes, which is significantly below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = -1.5). The variability in sleep duration is also notable (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.18). The median sleep start time is very late at 3:43 AM, with moderate variability in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.04). The participant also reports a higher than average number of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score = 0.7).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score, which is not directly provided but can be inferred from the data and correlations, likely falls within the **top_50** percentile of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors support this conclusion. The most significant indicator is the exceptionally short median sleep duration (5 hours and 59 minutes), with a Z-score of -1.5, placing this metric significantly in the lower end of sleep duration distribution and highly correlated with poorer sleep. The very late median sleep start time (3:43 AM), coupled with a high frequency of naps, also suggests significant sleep schedule disruption.

While not all metrics directly correlate with PSQI, the presence of elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.46) and lower self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -1.01) are known to be associated with poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant's significant recreational drug use, with a Z-score of 5.44, is a strong behavioral factor that can negatively impact sleep architecture and subjective sleep quality. The low interdaily stability of their heart rate (Z-score = -1.32) also points to a less regulated circadian rhythm, which is often linked to impaired sleep.

Considering the overall picture, the objective sleep duration deficit, the disrupted sleep timing, and the presence of psychological and behavioral factors that are commonly linked to poor sleep quality strongly suggest that this participant would have a PSQI score in the upper half of the distribution, indicating a need for sleep quality improvement.

71193,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several notable psychological and behavioral patterns that may influence their sleep quality. High scores on the CES-D (39.0, Z=2.67) and STAI (60.0, Z=1.85) indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively. These elevated levels are positively correlated with PSQI score (CES-D: 0.49, STAI: 0.4), suggesting a substantial contribution of psychological distress to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively low (Score: 28.0, Z=-1.43) and positively correlated with better sleep quality (-0.35), while happiness is also low (Current: 2.0, Z=-1.61) and negatively correlated with PSQI score (-0.27). Trust in others is also below average (Score: 2.5, Z=-1.42). Stress levels are elevated (Score: 25.0, Z=0.92) with a weak positive correlation to PSQI score (0.2).

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports no substance usage. However, physical activity is limited, with infrequent exercise alone (1-2 times a month, Z=-0.43) and no exercise with others or participation in sports. Sedentary leisure activities are prevalent, with significant time spent on video games (1-2 hours, Z=2.47), internet usage (1-2 hours, Z=0.18), listening to music (1-2 hours, Z=0.67), and sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z=1.41). Reading and socializing with friends are infrequent activities. These patterns, particularly the high engagement in video games and sedentary hobbies, are associated with a slightly higher PSQI score.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate regularity, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.6 (Z=1.57) and an Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of 0.54 (Z=1.82), both indicating some degree of daily structure. The Mesor (75.33, Z=0.19) and Amplitude (13.74, Z=0.96) are within typical ranges. The Acrophase at 5:49 PM suggests a late chronotype. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, there is a significant deviation from the mesor during the late evening and early morning hours, with negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate) from 2-3 AM (-12.82, Z=-0.03) to 6-7 AM (-21.92, Z=-0.64), potentially reflecting a prolonged period of reduced physiological activity during sleep. Conversely, there are pronounced positive deviations during the afternoon, particularly between 2-3 PM (19.37, Z=2.28) and 3-4 PM (20.03, Z=2.01), suggesting a peak in physiological arousal during these hours, which may be linked to late sleep onset.

Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 2 minutes (Z=1.05), suggesting sufficient time in bed. However, the median sleep start time is quite late at 01:47:30. The standard deviation for sleep duration (55 minutes, Z=-1.04) and sleep start time (41 minutes, Z=-0.93) are within a reasonable range, indicating some consistency. The average daily nap frequency is slightly elevated (0.19, Z=1.34), which could be a compensatory behavior for insufficient nocturnal sleep or a consequence of poor sleep quality. The correlations between these sleep statistics and PSQI score are generally weak to moderate, with sleep duration showing a slight positive correlation (0.05) and sleep duration variability showing a moderate positive correlation (0.2).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality. On one hand, the relatively long median sleep duration of over 8 hours, coupled with moderate variability in sleep duration and start time, might suggest a foundation for adequate rest. The individual's resting heart rate is within the average range, and their circadian rhythm shows some structural regularity.

However, significant psychological distress, characterized by high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), is strongly associated with a higher PSQI score. Low self-esteem and happiness further contribute to this profile, indicating a substantial psychological burden that is likely impacting sleep. The late sleep onset time, coupled with a pronounced peak in physiological arousal in the late afternoon, may be indicative of a disturbed sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, the participant engages in extensive sedentary activities, particularly video gaming, which has a slight positive correlation with PSQI score, suggesting that these habits may not be conducive to restorative sleep. The presence of occasional naps, while not excessively frequent, could also point towards difficulties maintaining consolidated nocturnal sleep.

Considering the significant psychological distress (high CES-D and STAI scores) and the potential impact of sedentary behaviors and late sleep onset on sleep quality, it is likely that this participant falls into the **top 50%** of the study population for PSQI scores, indicating poorer sleep quality. The strong positive correlations between psychological distress measures and PSQI score are particularly compelling indicators of this.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score of -0.66) and low chronic anxiety (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score of -0.82), suggesting a generally stable emotional state. Self-esteem is reported at a moderately high level (Score of 44.0, Z-Score of 0.82), though this score is outside the typical range for the RSES scale and may warrant further investigation if the interpretation is accurate. Happiness is reported as notably high (Score of 5.0, Z-Score of 1.64), indicating a positive subjective well-being. Conversely, perceived stress levels are moderate (Score of 19.0, Z-Score of -0.71), and health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score of 3.56, Z-score of -0.53). The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.71 falls within the underweight category.

Behaviorally, this participant abstains from all forms of substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, with significantly lower than average Z-scores for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. In terms of exercise, there is a notable pattern of exercising alone frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-Score of 1.07) while rarely, if ever, exercising with others (""Not at all,"" Z-Score of -1.58). Sports participation is also reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits are skewed towards passive activities; time spent watching TV/videos/movies is moderate (16-30 minutes), while engagement in video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and other sedentary hobbies are all reported at very low frequencies. Notably, internet usage is particularly low (""15 minutes or less,"" Z-Score of -1.83).

Physiologically, as measured by the wearable device, the participant demonstrates a relatively regular circadian rhythm. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below the population average (Value of 71.71, Z-Score of -0.3), and their resting heart rate is also on the lower side (Value of 53.05, Z-Score of -0.61), suggesting good cardiovascular health. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Value of 15.86, Z-Score of 1.64), indicating a significant daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, occurs in the early evening (6:32 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct patterns of physiological arousal. A pronounced dip in heart rate occurs in the early morning hours, particularly between 4 AM and 8 AM, with the most significant negative deviations observed between 5 AM and 8 AM, suggesting a period of low physiological activity. Conversely, evening hours, specifically from 6 PM onwards, show a marked increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor, with substantial positive deviations observed between 6 PM and 11 PM, peaking between 8 PM and 9 PM. This suggests heightened physiological arousal during the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 52 minutes, which is slightly shorter than average (Z-Score of -0.39). The variability in sleep duration is close to the population average (Z-Score of 0.02). The median sleep start time is late, around 1:58 AM, and the variability in sleep start times is somewhat lower than average (Z-Score of -0.4). The average number of daily naps is slightly above the population norm (Value of 0.12, Z-Score of 0.61).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a profile that leans towards better sleep quality, placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. Several factors support this conclusion. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are often correlated with poor sleep quality. Their reported happiness is notably high. While their median sleep duration is slightly below average, the standard deviation in sleep duration is close to the population average, suggesting relative consistency. The late median sleep start time (around 1:58 AM) is a potential indicator of a shifted sleep phase, but the relatively low variability in sleep start times suggests a consistent, albeit late, schedule.

Crucially, the physiological data from the wearable device presents a mixed but predominantly positive picture regarding sleep regularity. The circadian rhythm metrics, including interdaily stability and intradaily variability, are not provided with direct interpretations for PSQI correlation, but the autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value of 0.4, Z-Score of 0.64) suggests some degree of daily regularity. The significant positive deviations in heart rate during the evening hours (6 PM onwards), peaking in the late evening, could indicate preparatory physiological states for sleep, although the late timing might suggest a delayed sleep onset. However, the absence of significant negative correlations with PSQI score for most of these metrics, and the presence of slightly positive correlations with better sleep indicators like lower stress, higher self-esteem, and higher happiness, further support a better sleep quality profile. For instance, higher happiness and trust have a negative correlation with PSQI, and this participant exhibits high happiness.

The absence of substance usage, moderate engagement in solitary exercise, and minimal screen time in the late evening (contrasted with the physiological arousal pattern) also indirectly suggest a lifestyle conducive to better sleep. While the average sleep duration is slightly reduced, the overall pattern of psychological well-being, lifestyle choices, and physiological signals does not strongly indicate significant sleep disturbances that would place them in the top 50th percentile for poor sleep quality.

95374,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral factors that likely influence their sleep quality. Self-reported psychological measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 1.53) and a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.56). While self-esteem is within the average range for the population (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.96, indicating slightly lower than average), current happiness is notably low (Happy Z-score: -1.61). Stress levels are also below average for the population (Stress Z-score: -0.71). These psychological states, particularly the higher depressive symptom burden and lower happiness, are often associated with poorer sleep quality.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage and minimal engagement in physical activity, including exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports. This lack of physical exertion, coupled with sedentary recreational habits, may contribute to disruptions in sleep patterns. Notably, the participant spends significant time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47), with a particularly high Z-score for video game engagement, suggesting this is a prominent leisure activity. Socializing with friends also occupies a notable portion of their time (3-4 hours, Z-score: 1.74).

Wearable data reveals a generally stable circadian rhythm, with an interdaily stability Z-score of 0.42 and an intradaily variability Z-score of 0.17, both close to population means, suggesting some degree of regularity. The acrophase occurs in the early evening (7:41 PM), indicating a typical pattern of peak physiological activity. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Z-score: 2.06), suggesting a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the average participant. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.32), and the resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score: -0.8), potentially reflecting a lower baseline physiological state.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor provides insight into daily physiological arousal patterns. Significant deviations from the mesor occur during the night and early morning. Specifically, there are large positive deviations (indicating higher than average heart rate) in the late evening and early nighttime hours (e.g., 7-8 PM Z-score: 3.42, 10-11 PM Z-score: 1.91, 12-1 AM Z-score: 2.04). Conversely, there are substantial negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate) during the typical sleep window (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-score: -0.38, 5-6 AM Z-score: -0.85, 6-7 AM Z-score: -1.45, 7-8 AM Z-score: -1.9). This pattern, particularly the elevated heart rate in the early hours of the night, could signify difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, followed by periods of very low heart rate that may reflect prolonged deep sleep or periods of low activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 15 minutes, which is very close to the population average (Z-score: 0.09). However, the standard deviation for sleep duration is high (Z-score: 2.68), suggesting significant variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is very late, at 03:11:48 AM, with a substantial standard deviation (Z-score: 1.43), indicating considerable irregularity in sleep timing. The participant also reports a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Z-score: 1.75), which can further disrupt regular sleep schedules and contribute to poor sleep quality.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The PSQI population data indicates a mean score of 6.72, with a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. This suggests that scores above 6.0 are in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

The participant's data presents a mixed picture. On one hand, their median sleep duration is within the average range, and their circadian rhythm measures (Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability) are not markedly aberrant. Their resting heart rate and mesor are also below average. However, several factors point towards potentially poorer sleep quality. The high amplitude of their circadian rhythm and the significant deviations in heart rate during the night, especially the elevated heart rate in the early night, suggest physiological dysregulation around sleep onset. The notably late and variable sleep start times, along with frequent napping, are strong indicators of disrupted sleep patterns, which are common contributors to high PSQI scores. Furthermore, the elevated CES-D scores (depressive symptoms) and low happiness scores are often correlated with subjective reports of poor sleep quality. While the correlation for some negative psychological factors with PSQI is moderate (e.g., CES-D 0.49), the presence of these factors, combined with the behavioral indicators of irregular sleep timing and napping, leans towards a higher PSQI score.

Considering the significant variability in sleep duration, the very late and inconsistent sleep start times, the presence of frequent naps, and the elevated depressive symptom burden, it is likely that this participant experiences poorer sleep quality. These factors are consistently associated with higher PSQI scores. Therefore, it is probable that their PSQI score falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

This participant presents with a moderate level of psychological distress, as indicated by a CES-D score of 14, placing them in the ""Not depressed"" classification but with a positive correlation to PSQI score, suggesting that higher depressive symptoms, even if not clinically significant, may be associated with poorer sleep. Their STAI-Trait score of 41 suggests a tendency towards chronic anxiety, which correlates positively with PSQI score, further implying a potential link between anxiety and compromised sleep quality. Self-esteem is within the average range with a score of 34 and a negative correlation to PSQI, indicating that higher self-esteem is associated with better sleep. Objective measures of physiological regulation reveal a Mesor (average heart rate) of 66.36 bpm, which is below average for the study population (Z-score of -1.04), potentially indicating a lower basal metabolic rate or a more relaxed physiological state. The amplitude of 13.91 bpm is above average (Z-score of 1.01), suggesting a larger diurnal variation in heart rate, which could be indicative of a more robust diurnal rhythm or potentially heightened reactivity. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed at 4:37 PM, aligning with typical daytime activity peaks.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a relatively structured daily rhythm, as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score of 2.07), indicating consistent daily patterns. However, their Intradaily Variability is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.03), suggesting moderate fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Notably, the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also high (Z-score of 1.74), reinforcing the presence of a regular daily cycle. In terms of activities, this participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), which is generally associated with healthier sleep. They engage in regular exercise, specifically ""Exercised Alone"" three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), which can be beneficial for sleep, though this is associated with a slight negative correlation to PSQI, suggesting that very high exercise frequency might be associated with slightly worse sleep in this context. They also engage in ""Exercised with Others"" and ""Sports"" with a frequency of 1-2 times a month, which is below average. Leisure activities are dominated by moderate to high screen time, with ""Video Games"" at 1-2 hours (Z-score of 2.47) and ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" at 1-2 hours (Z-score of 1.28), and ""Internet Usage"" at 2-3 hours (Z-score of 0.85). These high screen time habits, particularly video games, correlate positively with PSQI, suggesting they may negatively impact sleep.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score of 0.14). The standard deviation of sleep duration is 108 minutes, slightly higher than average (Z-score of 0.17), suggesting some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is around 00:21 AM, which is later than average (indicated by a positive z-score if the mean start time were earlier, but without a direct average to compare, this is an inference based on typical sleep schedules). The standard deviation for sleep start time is 99 minutes, also suggesting some inconsistency in bedtime. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score of -0.86), which is a positive indicator for consolidated nighttime sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we will holistically analyze the evidence presented by their self-report surveys, wearable activity metrics, and sleep statistics in relation to their correlations with the PSQI score.

Evidence for a potentially **low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile)**, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality, includes:
*   **No substance usage:** This is a positive indicator and generally associated with better sleep.
*   **Moderate exercise frequency:** Engaging in exercise, particularly alone, can be beneficial for sleep.
*   **No daily naps:** This suggests consolidated nighttime sleep.
*   **Resting Heart Rate:** The participant's resting heart rate of 50 bpm (Z-score -0.97) is on the lower side, which can be indicative of good cardiovascular health and a more relaxed state.
*   **Health Satisfaction:** A Z-score of -1.2 indicates below-average satisfaction with physical health, which might seem counterintuitive for good sleep, but the low correlation with PSQI (-0.22) means it's not a strong predictor of poor sleep for this individual.

Evidence for a **high PSQI score (top 50th percentile)**, indicating relatively poor sleep quality, includes:
*   **Anxiety Proneness (STAI):** A score of 41 suggests chronic anxiety, which correlates positively with PSQI (0.4), indicating that higher anxiety is linked to poorer sleep quality.
*   **High Screen Time:** Significant time spent on ""Video Games"" (Z-score 2.47) and ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (Z-score 1.28), along with ""Internet Usage"" (Z-score 0.85), all show positive correlations with PSQI. This suggests that these sedentary, screen-based activities may contribute to poorer sleep quality.
*   **Slightly higher variability in sleep:** The standard deviation for sleep duration and sleep start time, while not extremely high, suggests some inconsistency in sleep patterns.
*   **Depressive Symptoms (CESD):** While classified as ""Not depressed,"" the CES-D score of 14 correlates positively with PSQI (0.49), implying that even sub-clinical levels of depressive symptoms may negatively impact sleep.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant exhibits some healthy behaviors such as no substance use and consistent exercise, the presence of chronic anxiety (STAI) and significant screen time, particularly video gaming, are strongly associated with poorer sleep quality via positive correlations with PSQI. The positive correlation of CES-D scores also suggests that even mild mood disturbances contribute to poorer sleep. The physiological data shows a robust circadian rhythm with high stability, which is generally positive for sleep, but the high amplitude might indicate underlying physiological reactivity. Considering the significant negative influences of anxiety and high screen time, which are directly linked to higher PSQI scores in this dataset, it is likely that this participant falls within the **top 50th percentile** for PSQI, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality.

43125,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits notable psychological and behavioral patterns that may influence sleep quality. A significantly elevated score on the CES-D (Z-score 2.47) indicates a substantial burden of depressive symptoms over the past week, which is positively correlated with PSQI scores (0.49). Similarly, the STAI Trait anxiety score is notably high (Z-score 1.16), with a moderate positive correlation to PSQI (0.4). In contrast, self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) are within the lower end of the study distribution, though their correlations with PSQI are negative (-0.35 and -0.27 respectively), suggesting that lower self-esteem and happiness are associated with poorer sleep quality. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Z-score -0.7), with a negative correlation to PSQI.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in frequent substance use, consuming beer three or more times a week (Z-score 1.72) and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.94). Notably, recreational drug use is reported as 1-2 times a week, with a very high Z-score (5.44), although its correlation with PSQI is negligible (0.07). Conversely, the participant does not engage in any form of exercise, including exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, indicated by significantly negative Z-scores for all exercise metrics (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). Daily sedentary activities are prevalent, with 1-2 hours of watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and 2-3 hours of internet usage (Z-score 0.85). Video game engagement is also elevated (Z-score 1.71). Socializing with friends is relatively low (Z-score -0.62) and reading is reported as not done at all (Z-score -0.67).

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant exhibits a high Mesor (circadian rhythm average) heart rate (Z-score 0.62) and a particularly high amplitude (Z-score 1.36), suggesting a wider daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is noted at 6:29 PM. The resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.4). Circadian rhythm regularity appears somewhat compromised, with interdaily stability at 0.44 (Z-score 0.25) indicating moderate regularity of daily patterns, and intradaily variability at 0.49 (Z-score -0.39) suggesting a relatively low within-day fluctuation. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderate (Z-score 0.48).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, there are significant negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours, with the deepest troughs occurring between 3-4 AM (-21.66) and 4-5 AM (-23.66), suggesting periods of low physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, elevated heart rate deviations are observed in the late evening, particularly between 7-8 PM (19.36) and 8-9 PM (18.99), and again from 10-11 PM (17.28) to 11 PM-12 AM (12.95). This pattern of delayed and elevated heart rate in the evening, coupled with profound lows in the early morning, could reflect disrupted sleep-wake cycles.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 28 minutes (Z-score 0.35), which is slightly above average. However, the sleep start time is consistently late, with a median of 02:00:00 and a standard deviation of 45 minutes (Z-score -0.82), suggesting significant variability and a delayed sleep phase. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also notable (72 minutes, Z-score -0.66), indicating some inconsistency in nightly sleep. Daily naps are reported with a mean of 0.14 (Z-score 0.82), which is above average and may reflect attempts to compensate for poor nighttime sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators relevant to sleep quality, with a substantial influence from psychological distress and lifestyle habits. The participant reports high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 2.47) and anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.16), both of which are positively correlated with PSQI scores. Furthermore, low self-esteem and happiness are associated with worse sleep quality, as indicated by their negative correlation with PSQI. The participant's sedentary lifestyle, characterized by a complete absence of exercise and significant time spent on screen-based activities like watching TV and internet usage, are also factors that can negatively impact sleep. The late median sleep start time (02:00:00) and its variability, along with a moderate deviation in sleep duration, suggest a disrupted sleep schedule. While median sleep duration is adequate, the physiological data indicating elevated heart rate in the late evening and profound lows in the early morning, coupled with the delayed sleep onset, are strong indicators of poor sleep regulation. The infrequent but significant use of recreational drugs may also contribute to sleep disturbances.

Considering the strong positive correlations between psychological distress (depression and anxiety) and PSQI scores, the high levels of these symptoms, combined with the behavioral indicators of a sedentary lifestyle and a significantly delayed and variable sleep schedule, strongly suggest a poor overall sleep quality. The average PSQI score in the population is 6.71, with a 75th percentile of 8.0. Given the magnitude of psychological distress and behavioral patterns indicative of poor sleep hygiene, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the top 50% of the study population, signifying poorer sleep quality.

98117,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits elevated levels of psychological distress, characterized by a significantly high score on the CES-D scale (Z-score of 2.05), indicating a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. Concurrently, their score on the STAI-Trait anxiety scale is also elevated (Z-score of 1.16), suggesting a proneness to chronic anxiety. These psychological factors are associated with a moderate positive correlation with PSQI score (0.49 for CES-D, 0.40 for STAI), implying that higher distress levels may contribute to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range for the population (Z-score of -0.87), with a weak negative correlation with PSQI score (-0.35), suggesting that higher self-esteem might be associated with better sleep. Trust in others is notably low (Z-score of -2.07), and happiness levels are also below average (Z-score of -1.61), both exhibiting weak negative correlations with PSQI score. Stress levels are reported as average (Z-score of 0.1), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI score.

Behaviorally, this participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and minimal engagement in exercise (exercised alone, exercised with others, sports all reported as ""Not at all""). This lack of physical activity is reflected in generally low Z-scores for exercise frequency. Their daily recreational habits are skewed towards sedentary activities with high screen time. Specifically, they spend a considerable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.91), playing video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 1.71), and using the internet (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.19). These patterns of high screen time are positively correlated with PSQI score, albeit weakly. Notably, socializing with friends is reported as minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-score -2.2), suggesting potential social isolation, which is weakly negatively correlated with PSQI score.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm, indicated by a stable mesor (Z-score 0.96) and a moderate amplitude (Z-score -0.42). The acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurs in the late afternoon (6:27 PM), which is typical. However, the hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor during the night and early morning hours. Specifically, there are substantial positive deviations in the late evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 14.24, 6-7 PM: 11.96) and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: 3.11, 1-2 AM: 0.58). Conversely, there are pronounced negative deviations during the core sleep window (2-3 AM: -3.85, 3-4 AM: -6.84, 4-5 AM: -12.1, 5-6 AM: -14.31, 6-7 AM: -16.19). This pattern of heart rate fluctuation suggests a disrupted physiological state during expected sleep periods, potentially reflecting difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or physiological arousal during the night. The resting heart rate is within the average range for the population (Z-score 0.98).

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes, which is below the population mean and falls into the lower half of reported durations (Z-score -0.71). The standard deviation for sleep duration is notably high (Z-score 3.02), suggesting significant variability in nightly sleep. The median sleep start time is very late (04:03:17), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is exceptionally high (Z-score 4.33), indicating extreme irregularity in sleep timing. These findings, particularly the short duration and highly variable sleep schedule, are strongly associated with poorer sleep quality, as indicated by their positive correlations with PSQI score. The low average daily nap duration (Z-score 0.12) suggests minimal napping.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides strong indicators of potentially poor sleep quality. The elevated levels of depressive and anxious symptoms, coupled with low self-esteem, low trust, and low happiness, are all psychological factors that often correlate with diminished sleep quality. Their daily habits are characterized by extensive sedentary screen time and a lack of physical activity, which can negatively impact sleep hygiene.

Crucially, the wearable data reveals significant irregularities in sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is notably short, and the standard deviations for both sleep duration and sleep start time are extremely high, indicating substantial variability and a highly disrupted sleep schedule. The physiological data, specifically the hourly heart rate deviations, suggest that the body is not in a state of rest during typical sleep hours, with pronounced negative deviations during the night.

The population PSQI distribution indicates a median score of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. Given the participant's profile: significant psychological distress, sedentary lifestyle, and critically, highly irregular and short sleep durations, it is highly probable that their PSQI score would reflect poor sleep quality. This would place them in the upper half of the distribution (top 50th percentile). The positive correlations between key sleep metrics (duration variability, start time variability) and PSQI score, along with the psychological distress, further support this conclusion.

24883,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by moderate levels of anxiety and lower than average self-esteem. While not clinically depressed (CES-D score of 9.0, Z-score -0.45), the STAI-Trait score of 42.0 falls within the ""anxious"" classification, with a Z-score of 0.07 indicating a slight elevation relative to the study population. Notably, the participant reports significantly lower than average self-esteem (Z-score 1.52), which is incongruent with the scale's range (10-40) and higher scores indicating greater self-esteem; this indicates an error in data entry or interpretation for this specific metric. A trust score of 2.67 (Z-score -1.1) suggests a tendency towards lower trust in others, aligning with a slightly below-average happiness score (Z-score -0.53). Stress levels are slightly above average (Z-score 0.38), correlating positively with sleep disturbance. The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) is 16.84, which is considerably low, potentially indicating undernourishment or a very lean physique. Health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score -0.7), which may be related to these physiological indicators or other unmeasured factors.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, with associated Z-scores indicating this is above the population average. Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all"". Physical activity levels are low, with exercise occurring only 1-2 times a month alone and no reported exercise with others or participation in sports (Z-scores -0.43, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). Daily recreation predominantly involves sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage for moderate durations (Z-scores 0.01 and -0.49). Time spent listening to music is limited (Z-score -0.72), and socializing with friends is notably infrequent (Z-score -1.41). The participant reports not engaging in video games or reading, and other sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm, evidenced by a relatively low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.31) and a moderate autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.06). The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle, is 69.03 bpm (Z-score -0.67), which is lower than the population average, consistent with a lower resting heart rate of 52.2 bpm (Z-score -0.71). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also relatively low (Z-score -1.11), suggesting less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 7:01 PM. Analysis of the hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate in the early morning hours (1 AM - 3 AM), with significant positive deviations (Z-scores 1.95, 2.36, 2.82), followed by a pronounced drop into negative deviations during the pre-awakening hours (3 AM - 7 AM), reaching a nadir between 6-7 AM. Heart rate then gradually increases throughout the day, with notable peaks in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 11-12 PM, 12-1 PM, 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 10-11 PM), though these deviations are generally less pronounced than the early morning elevations.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes (Z-score -0.38), which is slightly shorter than the population median. The standard deviation for sleep duration is 88 minutes, indicating moderate variability. The median sleep start time is 3:00 AM, which is considerably later than typical, and the standard deviation of 69 minutes suggests inconsistency in sleep onset. The participant reports an average of 0.07 daily naps. The correlation data suggests that higher stress levels are associated with poorer sleep quality (correlation 0.2), while higher trust and health satisfaction show a modest negative correlation with PSQI score, indicating better sleep quality. Interestingly, higher anxiety (STAI) and lower happiness also correlate positively with PSQI score.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality. On one hand, the participant exhibits relatively stable circadian rhythm metrics (low intradaily variability, moderate autocorrelation), a lower resting heart rate, and a moderate amount of sleep. The low correlation coefficients between many of the wearable and behavioral metrics and PSQI score suggest that these factors are not strongly driving sleep quality in this individual. Furthermore, the participant does not report significant levels of depression.

However, several factors suggest a potentially poorer sleep quality, likely placing them in the upper half of the PSQI distribution. The late and inconsistent sleep start time (median 3:00 AM with a 69-minute standard deviation) is a significant indicator of disrupted sleep scheduling. The elevated heart rate deviations observed during the early morning hours (1 AM - 3 AM) could reflect physiological arousal that is interfering with sleep continuity. The slightly shorter median sleep duration, while not drastically low, combined with the late sleep onset, may contribute to a feeling of insufficient rest. Furthermore, higher stress levels, moderate alcohol consumption, and a tendency towards anxiety are all known contributors to poor sleep quality, and these are reflected in the participant's self-reported data and show positive correlations with PSQI score. The notably low self-esteem and below-average health satisfaction, although not directly correlated with PSQI in the provided data, could also indirectly impact overall well-being and sleep.

Considering the substantial irregularity in sleep timing, potential physiological disruptions during sleep, and contributing psychological factors like stress and anxiety, it is more probable that this participant's PSQI score would fall into the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological patterns, with implications for sleep quality. Self-reported data indicate a generally positive psychological state. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score of -0.24) and moderate chronic anxiety (STAI score of 41.0, Z-score of -0.03). Notably, self-esteem is at the upper end of the typical range (Score of 42.0, Z-score of 0.54, interpreted as higher self-worth given the scale's directionality). They also report high levels of happiness (Z-score of 1.64) and trust (Z-score of 1.47), which are positive indicators. Academic performance is strong, with all reported GPAs above 3.8. However, the participant experiences relatively high stress levels (Score of 22.0, Z-score of 0.1) compared to the study population, though this is not extreme. Health satisfaction is average (Score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.2).

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a predominantly sedentary lifestyle in terms of recreational activities. They report not engaging in several common leisure activities, including watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, listening to music, reading, and other sedentary hobbies, with corresponding low Z-scores for time spent on these activities. Internet usage is limited to 16-30 minutes daily (Z-score of -1.16). Socializing with friends occurs for 16-30 minutes (Z-score of -1.41), which is also on the lower end of the spectrum. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, with significantly negative Z-scores across these categories, indicating very low or no reported use. In terms of exercise, the participant engages in exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.23), which is a positive engagement, but exercises alone and participates in sports less than 1-2 times a month, reflected in low Z-scores for these frequencies.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals some notable patterns. The participant has a low resting heart rate (Value of 45.8, Z-score of -1.47), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The mesor (average daily heart rate level) is also low (Value of 64.28, Z-score of -1.32). However, the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is high (Value of 15.84, Z-score of 1.64), indicating a substantial daily fluctuation. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (5:29 PM). The hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor shows a distinct pattern: significant negative deviations are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-8 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.27 to -1.65), indicating a substantially lower than average heart rate during this period. Conversely, there are pronounced positive deviations in the evening and early night, particularly between 5-6 PM (Z-score of 4.07) and 9-10 PM (Z-score of 3.01), suggesting periods of higher physiological arousal. The interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (Value of 0.51, Z-score of 0.83), while intradaily variability is also moderate (Value of 0.6, Z-score of 0.39). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Value of 0.23, Z-score of -0.78), suggesting less day-to-day consistency in the pattern of heart rate.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score of -0.11), which is close to the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is notably low (Value of 40 minutes, Z-score of -1.38), suggesting consistent sleep duration night to night. The median sleep start time is late, at 1:49 AM, with a standard deviation of 56 minutes (Z-score of -0.6), indicating some variability in sleep onset. There are no reported daily naps.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's overall sleep quality relative to the study population, we examine several factors. The participant's sleep duration is within a healthy range, and crucially, the consistency of their sleep duration is high, as indicated by the low standard deviation of sleep duration. The median sleep start time of 1:49 AM is relatively late, and while the standard deviation of sleep start time is moderate, this late onset could contribute to sleep schedule disruptions.

From the self-report data, while the participant exhibits positive psychological traits such as high happiness and self-esteem, they also report moderate stress levels and a significant positive correlation between stress and PSQI score (correlation of 0.2). Anxiety also shows a moderate positive correlation (0.4) with PSQI, and while their current anxiety score is not high, this indicates a potential vulnerability. Furthermore, the high amplitude of their heart rate rhythm and the pronounced deviations from the mesor, particularly the elevated heart rate in the evening, might reflect heightened physiological arousal during a period when one would typically expect a decline, potentially interfering with sleep onset. The low autocorrelation at 24 hours in heart rate variability suggests a less consistent daily rhythm, which can negatively impact sleep.

Considering the moderate positive correlations between stress and anxiety with PSQI, alongside the late sleep start time and the physiological indicators of evening arousal, it is plausible that these factors contribute to a less than optimal sleep experience. The strong academic performance and engagement in social activities with others are positive, but the overall pattern suggests potential challenges in sleep consolidation or efficiency, even with adequate duration. Given the population PSQI mean of 6.73 and 75th percentile of 8.0, a PSQI score above 6.0 would place an individual in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. The combination of late sleep onset, potential for evening arousal impacting sleep onset, and moderate correlations of stress/anxiety with PSQI suggests the participant likely falls into the upper half of the PSQI distribution.

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data reveal a profile characterized by relatively low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, alongside high self-esteem and happiness. Specifically, the STAI score of 31.0 (Z-score: -1.02) indicates a lack of chronic anxiety, and the CES-D score of 4.0 (Z-score: -0.97) suggests minimal depressive symptom burden. Conversely, the Self-Esteem score of 49.0 (Z-score: 1.52) is notably high, signifying robust self-worth. Happiness levels are also elevated, with a score of 5.0 (Z-score: 1.64). While trust in others is near the population average (Score: 3.17, Z-score: -0.14), stress levels are below average (Score: 19.0, Z-score: -0.71). Health satisfaction is relatively high (Score: 6.11, Z-score: 1.38).

Lifestyle behaviors indicate moderate substance usage, with beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs consumed 1-2 times a week, and non-prescribed drugs not at all. The Z-score for recreational drug usage (5.44) is exceptionally high, suggesting a significant deviation from the population norm in this specific behavior. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week alone and 1-2 times a month with others or in sports. Daily recreational habits show a substantial engagement in social media and music, with internet usage (3-4 hours) and listening to music (more than 4 hours) exhibiting high Z-scores of 1.52 and 2.06, respectively. Socializing with friends also represents a significant time commitment (more than 4 hours), with a Z-score of 2.53.

Wearable-derived physiological data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.39 (Z-score: -0.16) and an Intradaily Variability of 0.73 (Z-score: 1.3). The Mesor (67.64, Z-score: -0.86) and Amplitude (9.75, Z-score: -0.33) are within typical ranges, suggesting a regular underlying physiological rhythm. The Acrophase, the peak time of heart rate, is reported at 5:38 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is 53.85 bpm (Z-score: -0.51), which is lower than average, potentially indicating good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals elevated heart rates during the late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 10 PM and 1 AM (e.g., 10-11 PM: 16.9, Z-score: 1.65; 11-12 AM: 12.07, Z-score: 1.29; 12-1 AM: 4.52, Z-score: 0.9). Conversely, heart rates are notably lower in the early morning hours, from 2 AM to 6 AM, with substantial negative deviations from the Mesor (e.g., 2-3 AM: -14.51, Z-score: -0.27; 3-4 AM: -17.17, Z-score: -0.13; 4-5 AM: -17.42, Z-score: 0.11).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 26 minutes, which is slightly longer than average given the positive Z-score of 0.32. The standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low (60 minutes, Z-score: -0.94), suggesting consistency in sleep length. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:57 AM, with a standard deviation of 47 minutes, indicating moderate variability in bedtime. There are no reported daily naps, and the Z-score for mean daily naps (-0.86) suggests this is below the population average.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we examine the available data for indicators of sleep quality. The PSQI population data shows a mean score of 6.73, with a 50th percentile of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. Scores above 6.0 are generally considered indicative of poor sleep quality.

Several factors from the multimodal analysis can inform this assessment. The participant reports generally positive psychological states, including low anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high happiness. While these traits are often associated with better sleep, their direct correlation with the PSQI score in this dataset is mixed. For example, while STAI (anxiety) has a positive correlation of 0.4 with PSQI, CES-D (depression) has a correlation of 0.49, suggesting that higher levels of these symptoms are associated with poorer sleep quality. However, the participant's scores in these domains are low, which, in isolation, would suggest better sleep.

The lifestyle behaviors reveal some potentially disruptive elements. The high Z-score for recreational drug usage (5.44) is a notable outlier and, if linked to sleep, could negatively impact quality. However, the correlation of substance usage with PSQI is relatively low (e.g., Beer: 0.03, Wine/Liquor: 0.06, Recreational Drugs: 0.10). The high engagement in internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, particularly late into the night, could also contribute to sleep disruption. The positive correlation of internet usage (0.12), listening to music (0.13), and socializing with friends (0.06) with PSQI suggests these activities may be associated with poorer sleep outcomes, though the magnitudes of these correlations are modest.

From the wearable data, the elevated heart rate deviations from the Mesor during late evening and nighttime hours (10 PM - 1 AM) are a significant indicator of physiological arousal preceding sleep. This pattern, especially the marked increase between 10-11 PM (Z-score: 1.65), suggests that the participant may be experiencing difficulty in winding down before sleep. While the median sleep duration is good, the 7 hours and 26 minutes, and the relatively low standard deviation of sleep duration (60 minutes, Z-score: -0.94), suggest consistency. However, the median sleep start time of approximately 1:57 AM, coupled with the standard deviation of 47 minutes, indicates a somewhat delayed and variable sleep onset. The positive correlation of sleep start time standard deviation (0.18) with PSQI further supports this.

Considering the PSQI population data, where the 75th percentile is 8.0, a score of 6.0 would be at the median. The average PSQI score is 6.73. The observed physiological arousal patterns in the late evening and early morning, along with the relatively late and variable sleep start times, point towards potential disruptions in sleep quality. While the participant reports positive psychological states and consistent sleep duration, the late-night physiological arousal and bedtime variability are concerning. These factors are more likely to push the participant's overall PSQI score towards the higher end of the distribution. The positive correlations of symptoms like depression and anxiety, and behaviors like late-night internet and social activities, with PSQI, even if modest, reinforce this concern. Therefore, it is more likely that this participant falls into the top 50% of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

14847,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with notable associations with sleep quality. Self-reported data indicate elevated levels of both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86). These elevated scores, particularly for depressive symptoms, correlate positively with poorer sleep quality (CES-D correlation 0.49). Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range (Self-Esteem score of 35.0, Z-score -0.45) and shows a weak negative correlation with PSQI, suggesting higher self-esteem may be associated with better sleep. While the participant reports generally moderate happiness (Current happiness score 4.0, Z-score 0.55), there is a notable correlation between higher stress levels (Score 24.0, Z-score 0.65) and poorer sleep quality (correlation 0.2). Trust levels are exceptionally low (Score 1.67, Z-score -3.03), indicating a significant distrust of others, which has a minor negative correlation with PSQI. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Score 5.56, Z-score 0.97).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate daily activities, with a tendency towards higher screen time, specifically watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13). While internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18), reading is not a reported habit. Socializing with friends is reported for 2-3 hours weekly (Z-score 0.95), showing a slight negative correlation with PSQI. Exercise habits are mixed; the participant exercises alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), but not with others or in sports. Substance usage is generally low, with the exception of recreational drugs, which are used less than 1-2 times a month but have a positive Z-score (1.61), suggesting a higher-than-average usage within this category.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveal significant intraday variability in heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-score 2.01), indicating a less stable pattern of cardiovascular activity throughout the day, which correlates with poorer sleep. This is coupled with relatively low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score -0.49), suggesting a lack of consistent daily rhythm. The mesor (mean heart rate) is close to the population average (Mesor Z-score 0.1), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average (Amplitude Z-score -0.41). The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (5:43 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is also close to the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score 0.03).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of significant deviation, particularly between 2-3 AM and 3-4 AM, with values of -3.03 (Z-score 1.35) and -15.26 (Z-score 0.17) respectively. These late-night/early-morning deviations, especially the substantial dip in heart rate during the 3-4 AM hour, may reflect a disrupted sleep architecture or physiological stress during typical sleep periods. There are also notable positive deviations in the evening, peaking between 7-8 PM (14.3, Z-score 0.49), which could suggest periods of heightened arousal before sleep onset.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score -0.69), which is shorter than the population average and correlates with poorer sleep quality. The standard deviation of sleep duration is notably high (Value 134 minutes, Z-score 0.75), suggesting significant nightly variation in how long the participant sleeps. The median sleep start time is very late at 02:24:00, with a considerable standard deviation (Value 104 minutes, Z-score 0.46), pointing to irregular sleep timing. The participant also has a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score 1.9). These sleep metrics, particularly the shorter duration, high variability in duration and start time, and increased napping, are strongly associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a compelling case for a PSQI score falling in the upper half of the study population distribution, indicating relatively poor sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The self-reported data highlights elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety, both of which are known to negatively impact sleep. The positive correlation between these psychological distress measures and the PSQI score reinforces this concern. Furthermore, behavioral patterns such as higher screen time and infrequent exercise, coupled with low trust and average health satisfaction, paint a picture of potential lifestyle factors contributing to poor sleep hygiene.

The wearable data provides objective evidence supporting this conclusion. The significantly high intradaily variability in heart rate and low interdaily stability suggest a disrupted circadian rhythm, which is detrimental to consistent sleep. The sleep statistics are particularly concerning: a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the population average, coupled with a high standard deviation in sleep duration and a very late median sleep start time with high variability, all point towards significant sleep disturbances. The elevated mean daily naps further indicate fragmented or insufficient nighttime sleep. The positive correlations of sleep duration standard deviation, sleep start time standard deviation, and mean daily naps with the PSQI score underscore their contribution to poorer sleep quality.

Considering the confluence of these psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators, particularly the objective sleep metrics and their correlations with the PSQI, it is highly probable that this participant's overall sleep quality places them in the top 50% of the study population, signifying poorer sleep.

75438,6.0,0.387434554973822,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological patterns, all of which may contribute to their overall sleep quality. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.52), and higher than average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.73). Trust in others is also lower than the population average (Trust Z-score: -1.1), while self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Stress levels are also reported as somewhat elevated compared to the study population (Stress Z-score: -0.98). Health satisfaction, however, is above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.63). Regarding lifestyle, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer 1-2 times a month, Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week) and infrequent recreational drug use. They maintain a healthy Body Mass Index of 24.13. Physical activity is a notable aspect of their routine, with exercise occurring alone three or more times a week and with others/in sports 1-2 times a week, representing above-average engagement in physical activity. In contrast, sedentary leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, and reading are not engaged in, while internet usage is moderate, and listening to music and socializing with friends are more prominent daily recreational activities.

The wearable data provides further insight into the participant's physiological functioning and circadian rhythm. The resting heart rate is below the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.61), suggesting a potentially fitter cardiovascular system. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals an interdaily stability (Value: 0.33, Z-score: -0.66) and intradaily variability (Value: 0.39, Z-score: -1.09) that are lower than the population average, indicating a less regular and potentially more disrupted daily rhythm. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.36, Z-score: 0.31) is slightly above average, suggesting some degree of daily regularity in heart rate patterns. The mesor (Value: 69.46, Z-score: -0.61) is also below average, consistent with a lower resting heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 3:28 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows a notable pattern of reduced heart rate during the late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM deviation of -20.93, 4-5 AM of -21.2), indicative of typical sleep-related physiological slowing. During the day, there are periods of significant positive deviation, particularly in the afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM of 18.18, 1-2 PM of 17.25, 2-3 PM of 18.23), suggesting periods of increased cardiovascular arousal.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 2 minutes, which is considerably below the population average (Z-score: -1.43). The variability in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.15) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.38) are within a more typical range. The median sleep start time is late at 1:43 AM. The absence of naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86) suggests no significant compensatory sleep behavior during the day. The correlations provided, while not definitive, offer some direction. A positive correlation between stress scores and PSQI is observed (0.2), and the participant reports somewhat elevated stress. While not directly correlated with PSQI, lower self-esteem (-0.35) and trust (-0.21) may indirectly influence subjective sleep experiences.

Considering the participant's data, several factors point towards a potentially lower sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 2 minutes is significantly shorter than the population average, and this metric is known to be a substantial contributor to poor sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. While the participant reports low anxiety and depression, and moderate health satisfaction, the shorter sleep duration is a strong indicator of potential sleep issues. The later sleep start time and the observed pattern of physiological arousal during the day, coupled with decreased activity during typical sleep hours, might suggest some form of sleep phase delay or difficulty in maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, contributing to shorter sleep durations. The lower interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate also suggest a less structured daily routine, which can negatively impact sleep.

The participant's PSQI score would likely place them in the top 50% of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality.

99733,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score -0.86) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02), suggesting a generally stable psychological state. Self-esteem is also within the average range, with a score of 33.0 (Z-score -0.73). Reported happiness levels are slightly below average (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53), alongside a moderate level of trust in others (Trust score of 3.33, Z-score 0.18). Notably, stress levels are reported as 18.0 (Z-score -0.98), which is on the lower side of the spectrum for this measure. Health satisfaction is also above average at 5.0 (Z-score 0.55). Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, with significantly low Z-scores indicating minimal engagement in these behaviors compared to the study population.

Regarding physical activity and daily habits, the participant engages in exercise alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32), which is slightly above the average frequency, while exercising with others and participating in sports occur less than 1-2 times a month, with Z-scores of -0.88 and -0.42 respectively. Daily recreation is characterized by relatively low engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.62) and video games (reported as ""Do not do""). Internet usage is also limited to 16-30 minutes daily (Z-score -1.16). Listening to music and socializing with friends are reported as ""Do not do"" and ""16-30 minutes"" respectively, with notably low Z-scores for both (-1.19 and -1.41), suggesting minimal engagement in these activities. Reading, however, is engaged in for 15 minutes or less (Z-score 0.32), indicating a slightly higher frequency than other recreational pursuits. Sedentary hobbies are also limited to 15 minutes or less (Z-score -0.36).

Wearable data provides insights into the participant's physiological patterns and sleep behavior. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively stable pattern, with Interdaily Stability at 0.39 (Z-score -0.16) and Intradaily Variability at 0.7 (Z-score 1.09). The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is 0.26 (Z-score -0.53), suggesting moderate regularity in daily rhythms. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the day, is 74.93 bpm (Z-score 0.13), slightly above the population average, and the Amplitude is 9.44 bpm (Z-score -0.43), indicating a moderate daily variation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, is at 3:08 PM. Resting heart rate is 62.6 bpm (Z-score 0.53), which is higher than the study average.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct diurnal patterns. Lower heart rates, indicating reduced physiological arousal, are observed during the late night and early morning hours, with significant negative deviations observed between 1 AM and 6 AM, with the most pronounced being -16.76 at 5-6 AM. Heart rate begins to increase in the morning, with positive deviations appearing from 8-9 AM onwards. Peak positive deviations, suggesting higher physiological arousal, occur in the afternoon, with the highest being 15.5 bpm deviation between 12 PM and 1 PM, and 12.95 bpm between 11 AM and 12 PM. Heart rate then gradually decreases in the evening, with negative deviations reappearing from 9 PM onwards.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes (Z-score -0.58), which is slightly below the average sleep duration in the study population. The standard deviation for sleep duration is 86 minutes (Z-score -0.33), suggesting moderate variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is 00:38:21, with a standard deviation of 65 minutes (Z-score -0.39), indicating some inconsistency in bedtime. The participant reports very few daily naps, with a mean of 0.09 naps per day (Z-score 0.21).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators that suggest the participant likely falls within the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

Evidence supporting a lower PSQI score (bottom 50%) includes the participant's psychological profile, which is characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score -0.86 Z-score) and anxiety (STAI score -1.02 Z-score), as well as a relatively high self-esteem score (-0.73 Z-score). These factors are often associated with better subjective sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports low stress levels (-0.98 Z-score) and high health satisfaction (0.55 Z-score), which are positive indicators for sleep. Their lifestyle choices, such as complete abstinence from substance usage, also contribute to a profile generally conducive to good sleep.

While the median sleep duration is slightly below the population average (6 hours 43 minutes, -0.58 Z-score), the overall sleep duration variability is moderate. The median sleep start time is late, but its variability is also moderate. The low frequency of naps is also a positive indicator. The wearable data shows a generally regular circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability -0.16 Z-score), and the intradaily variability (1.09 Z-score) suggests a typical pattern of physiological activity throughout the day. While resting heart rate is slightly elevated, the overall pattern of heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates physiological recovery during the night.

There is minimal evidence suggesting a high PSQI score (top 50%), which would indicate poor sleep quality. The strong correlations between several positive psychological traits (low depression, low anxiety, high self-esteem) and PSQI score are negative, suggesting that better psychological well-being is associated with lower (better) PSQI scores. Conversely, while stress has a positive correlation with PSQI score (0.2), the participant's stress levels are reported as low.

Holistically, the participant presents with a constellation of traits and behaviors that are generally associated with better sleep quality. The absence of significant psychological distress, low stress, and healthier lifestyle choices, coupled with relatively stable circadian rhythms, outweigh the slightly shorter sleep duration. Therefore, it is most likely that this participant would have a PSQI score in the bottom half of the distribution.

The participant exhibits a mixed profile across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains. Self-reported anxiety levels are notably elevated (Z-score = 0.86), classifying the individual as anxious, while depressive symptomology is within the average range (CES-D Z-score = -0.03). Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.31), with a comparable trend observed in health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.53). Trust in others is also on the lower end of the spectrum (Z-score = -0.46). Happiness levels are slightly above average (Z-score = 0.55), and stress is moderately elevated (Z-score = 0.38). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high across semesters (3.8 to 3.94). Substance usage is minimal, with the individual reporting infrequent alcohol consumption (1-2 times a month) and abstaining from wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times per week in various forms, including solo, with others, and sports. Daily recreational activities lean towards lower engagement, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less), playing video games (15 minutes or less), internet usage (1-2 hours), and minimal time dedicated to reading or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is also reported as brief (31 minutes an hour), and listening to music is not a practiced habit.

Physiologically, the participant presents with a relatively low resting heart rate (Value = 46.3, Z-score = -1.41), indicating good cardiovascular fitness. The mesor, a measure of the central tendency of heart rate, is also lower than the population average (Value = 65.18, Z-score = -1.2). Circadian rhythm analysis reveals moderate regularity; interdaily stability is near the population average (Value = 0.4, Z-score = -0.08), while intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (Value = 0.51, Z-score = -0.25), suggesting a less erratic but potentially less robust daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is noted at 5:46 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight a significant dip during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-4 AM (Z-score = -1.45) and 4-5 AM (Z-score = -1.67), which is consistent with sleep periods. Conversely, pronounced elevations in heart rate deviation are observed during the evening, specifically between 7-8 PM (Z-score = 1.82) and 8-9 PM (Z-score = 2.25), and also in the late night/early morning hours (12-1 AM, Z-score = 1.4).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -1.17). Sleep duration exhibits moderate variability (Standard Deviation = 120 minutes, Z-score = 0.43). The median sleep start time is very late, at 02:02:30, with considerable variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation = 51 minutes, Z-score = -0.71), suggesting a highly irregular sleep schedule. The participant also reports minimal daily napping (Mean Daily Naps = 0.07, Z-score = -0.08). The correlations between various metrics and the PSQI score, while not definitive, suggest that higher anxiety (0.4), higher stress (0.2), and higher sleep duration variability (0.2) are weakly associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, lower self-esteem (-0.35), lower trust (-0.21), lower health satisfaction (-0.21), and lower happiness (-0.27) show a weak inverse relationship with PSQI score, suggesting these might be associated with better sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents several indicators that converge towards a poorer sleep quality, likely placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population for PSQI scores. The most significant indicators are the objective sleep duration and timing derived from wearable data. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes is substantially below the population mean and falls into the lower end of the distribution, as evidenced by the negative Z-score (-1.17). Furthermore, the extremely late median sleep start time of 02:02:30, coupled with a standard deviation of 51 minutes for sleep start time, strongly suggests a highly irregular and delayed sleep schedule, which is a common contributor to poor sleep quality. While other factors like elevated anxiety and stress could contribute, the direct sleep metrics are more directly linked to the PSQI domains. The low correlation values for most self-reported surveys and wearable metrics with PSQI score do not strongly suggest improvement in sleep quality, and in some cases, like sleep duration variability and stress, show a weak positive association, aligning with poorer sleep. The consistent, albeit weak, negative correlations of traits like self-esteem, trust, health satisfaction, and happiness with PSQI score might suggest better sleep for individuals scoring lower on these, implying this participant's sleep quality might be less affected by these factors as they are not in the extremely low range, but their direct sleep habits are more concerning. Given the objective evidence of insufficient and highly variable sleep timing, the participant's PSQI score is likely to be in the higher range, indicative of poorer sleep quality.

43794,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that may inform their sleep quality. Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.35), which is positively correlated with stress levels (Score = 26.0, Z-score = 1.19). Conversely, self-esteem (Z-score = -0.87) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.45) are below average for the study population, alongside lower than typical levels of happiness (Z-score = -0.53). Depressive symptoms, as measured by CES-D, are within the non-depressed range (Score = 10.0, Z-score = -0.34), and trust in others is also below average (Z-score = -0.78).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.94), while beer consumption is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score = -0.41). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise frequency is relatively low, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-score = -0.43) and with others also 1-2 times a month (Z-score = 0.53). Sedentary leisure activities are prominent, particularly listening to music for over 4 hours daily (Z-score = 2.06), while watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are relatively low. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals a less regular circadian rhythm than the study average, indicated by a significantly low Interdaily Stability (Value = 0.2, Z-score = -1.73). Intradaily Variability (Value = 0.55, Z-score = 0.03) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value = 0.23, Z-score = -0.78) suggest moderate day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns. The Mesor (Value = 76.93, Z-score = 0.41) and Amplitude (Value = 5.34, Z-score = -1.76) suggest a slightly elevated average heart rate and a reduced variability around this average compared to the population. The Acrophase is recorded at 5:00 PM. Resting heart rate is elevated (Value = 70.8, Z-score = 1.5), which could be indicative of physiological arousal. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of higher heart rates in the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score = 1.35; 4-5 AM, Z-score = 1.58; 5-6 AM, Z-score = 1.28), suggesting potential disruption during typical sleep periods. Conversely, heart rates are lower than expected during late afternoon and early evening hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 59 minutes (Z-score = -0.24), which is close to the population average, but with a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Value = 156 minutes, Z-score = 1.25). The median sleep start time is approximately 1:03 AM (Z-score not directly interpretable without population mean and SD, but the standard deviation of sleep start time is elevated at 122 minutes, Z-score = 0.86), suggesting significant variability in bedtime. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score = -0.86). The moderate positive correlations observed between stress, anxiety, and sleep metrics like sleep duration standard deviation and sleep start time standard deviation suggest that psychological distress may contribute to sleep irregularity.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score can be inferred by considering the available data in relation to the population distribution and the correlations with key metrics. The population's median PSQI score is 6.0, with a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score above 6.0 is generally considered indicative of poor sleep quality.

Several factors suggest the participant may have a PSQI score in the upper half of the distribution (top 50%), indicating poorer sleep quality. The elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.35) and stress levels (Z-score = 1.19) are positively correlated with PSQI scores, indicating that higher levels of these psychological states are associated with worse sleep quality. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a significantly low interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score = -1.73), suggesting a lack of consistent daily rhythmicity, which is often a marker of disrupted sleep. The elevated heart rate deviations during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score = 1.35; 4-5 AM, Z-score = 1.58) directly indicate physiological disturbance during a typical sleep period. The high standard deviation in both sleep duration (Z-score = 1.25) and sleep start time (Z-score = 0.86) further points to sleep inconsistency, a hallmark of poor sleep quality. While median sleep duration is close to average, the variability suggests fragmented or interrupted sleep. The low health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.45) also aligns with a poorer overall health perception, which can be linked to inadequate sleep.

Conversely, some metrics do not strongly suggest poor sleep. Depressive symptoms are not elevated, and self-esteem, happiness, and trust, while below average, do not show the strongest correlations with PSQI. The participant also reports infrequent substance use and does not use recreational or non-prescribed drugs, which are generally positive indicators for sleep.

Considering the pronounced indicators of psychological distress (anxiety, stress), significant circadian rhythm irregularity, marked variability in sleep timing and duration, and physiological arousal during typical sleep hours, the evidence strongly suggests that this participant is likely to have a PSQI score in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

51437,6.0,0.387434554973822,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data reveal a profile of relatively low depressive symptomatology and anxiety, as indicated by CES-D and STAI scores below the population mean. While self-esteem is slightly above average, the participant reports moderate levels of trust in others and average happiness. Notably, stress levels are below the population average. Physical health satisfaction is slightly above average. Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is infrequent, aligning with population norms. The participant engages in consistent exercise, specifically solo exercise and sports, at a frequency of three times a week or more, which is considerably higher than the population average. Daily sedentary recreational activities include watching TV/videos/movies and general internet usage, with limited time spent on video games, listening to music, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily.

The wearable data indicates a relatively irregular circadian rhythm. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.51), suggesting considerable fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, which can be indicative of a less structured daily physiological cycle. Conversely, Interdaily Stability is low (Z-score -0.82), indicating a lack of consistency in daily patterns. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is notably high (Z-score 1.29), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is low (Z-score -1.59), suggesting that while the average heart rate is elevated, the daily variation around this average is reduced. The Acrophase, occurring at 7:39 PM, indicates a late peak in heart rate, which may not align optimally with typical societal schedules. The Resting Heart Rate is also high (Z-score 1.77), potentially reflecting higher baseline physiological arousal or fitness levels. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor shows substantial increases during late night and early morning hours (12-1 AM, 1-2 AM), with pronounced positive deviations. Conversely, mid-afternoon hours (3-4 PM) exhibit the largest negative deviations, indicating periods of lower physiological activity relative to the daily average.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, which is below the population average, and a slightly elevated standard deviation in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:14:30, with a standard deviation that suggests some variability in sleep timing. The absence of daily naps is consistent with population norms. The correlation analysis suggests that higher CES-D and STAI scores are positively correlated with PSQI, indicating that greater depressive symptoms and anxiety may be associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction are negatively correlated with PSQI, suggesting these factors are associated with better sleep quality. For behavioral habits, exercise frequency (exercised alone, sports) and substance usage show very weak correlations with PSQI, while daily recreation habits like watching TV/videos/movies show a slight positive correlation. Wearable metrics show weak to negligible correlations with PSQI, with the exception of Amplitude, which shows a negative correlation, suggesting that lower variability in heart rate might be associated with better sleep quality.

Given the relatively low average sleep duration and late sleep onset, coupled with a potentially disrupted circadian rhythm as indicated by high intradaily variability and low interdaily stability in heart rate, the participant likely experiences suboptimal sleep. While the participant reports low levels of anxiety and depression, these factors are weakly correlated with PSQI in this dataset. The significant elevation in resting heart rate and Mesor, alongside the late acrophase, may contribute to sleep difficulties. The median sleep duration is below the population average (mean 6.73, median 6.0). Considering the overall pattern of late sleep start times, shorter sleep duration, and physiological indicators of circadian disruption, it is plausible that this participant falls into the upper half of the distribution for PSQI scores, indicating poorer sleep quality.

21932,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally lower-than-average level of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.97) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 28.0, Z-score of -1.31), indicating a relatively stable psychological disposition in these areas. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 50.0 and a Z-score of 1.66, suggesting a positive self-regard. Trust in others is at an average level (Score of 3.0, Z-Score of -0.46), and self-reported happiness is also near the population mean (Z-Score of -0.53). Stress levels are significantly lower than average, with a Z-score of -2.34. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high across multiple semesters. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55).

In terms of behavioral habits, substance usage is generally infrequent, with beer consumption reported as less than 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity includes exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, and participation in sports 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational habits lean towards lower engagement with activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and listening to music, with reported times of ""Do not do"" or minimal engagement. Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours), and social interaction with friends is reported as ""31 minutes an hour."" Reading and other sedentary hobbies are not frequently engaged in.

Wearable data reveals several patterns in physiological and circadian rhythms. The participant's Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.58) with a resting heart rate of 54.1, also below average (Z-score of -0.48). The amplitude of heart rate variation is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.44). Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, is somewhat lower than average (Z-score of 0.67), suggesting less consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Intradaily Variability is notably higher than average (Z-score of 0.95), implying more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is reported as 5:20 PM.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the 24-hour cycle. There are significant negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate) during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2-3 AM and 4-5 AM (Z-scores of -0.55 to -0.89). Conversely, substantial positive deviations (indicating higher than average heart rate) are observed in the early afternoon between 12-1 PM and 1-2 PM (Z-scores of 2.59 and 2.11, respectively), and again in the late evening between 10-11 PM (Z-score of 3.14). These patterns suggest a period of reduced physiological activity during sleep and heightened activity during specific waking periods, particularly in the afternoon and late evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 14 minutes, which is longer than the population average (Z-score of 1.31). The variability in sleep duration is also lower than average (Standard Deviation of 50 minutes, Z-score of -1.15), suggesting more consistent nightly sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is approximately 00:38, with a standard deviation of 55 minutes, indicating moderate consistency in bedtime. The frequency of napping is very low, close to zero.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data suggests the participant likely falls in the **bottom 50%** of the study population regarding their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several indicators support this conclusion. The participant reports a significantly longer median sleep duration (8 hours 14 minutes) than the average, and importantly, exhibits low variability in sleep duration. Lower variability in sleep duration is generally indicative of more consistent and thus better sleep. Furthermore, the participant's stress levels are exceptionally low, which is a significant correlate of good sleep quality. While some behavioral habits like less frequent engagement in sedentary hobbies or reading might be considered, these are generally not strong predictors of poor sleep quality when other factors are favorable. The high self-esteem and low anxiety and depression scores are also generally associated with better sleep.

Conversely, there is no strong evidence within this dataset to suggest a high PSQI score (indicating poor sleep quality). The positive sleep duration metrics, low stress, and generally positive psychological disposition all point away from a significantly impaired sleep experience as measured by the PSQI. The moderate sleep start time variability and slightly lower than average interdaily stability in heart rate are minor points that do not outweigh the substantial evidence for good sleep. The higher than average intradaily variability in heart rate, while notable, could be attributed to various factors and does not directly translate to a poor PSQI score without more specific sleep context.

This participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile that likely influences their sleep quality. Notably, high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 1.63) and moderate anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: 0.76) are present. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be relatively lower than the population average (SelfEsteem Z-score: -1.01). While happiness is reported slightly above average (Happy Z-score: 0.55), overall health satisfaction is below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.7). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is strong and increasing throughout the observed period. Substance use is characterized by moderate consumption of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94) and occasional beer consumption (1-2 times a month, Z-score: 0.3), with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is moderate, with solo exercise occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32) and sports participation also at a similar frequency (Z-score: 0.91). Sedentary daily activities include significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score: 1.13), watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64), and internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.49). Notably, reading and video gaming are not reported activities.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate variability, as indicated by Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.44, Z-score: 0.25) and Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.56, Z-score: 0.1), suggests a moderately structured circadian rhythm. The Mesor (Value: 76.96, Z-score: 0.41) is slightly elevated, indicating a higher average heart rate compared to the population. The Acrophase occurring at 5:23 PM suggests a peak in cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon. Analysis of hourly deviations from the Mesor reveals a pattern of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -11.74 to -17.28 bpm) and higher heart rates during evening and late morning hours (e.g., 7-8 PM with a deviation of 16.91 bpm, and 9-11 PM with deviations of 12.74 and 11.18 bpm). This pattern, particularly the pronounced dip in heart rate during sleep-related hours, is consistent with typical physiological responses during rest.

Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 47 minutes, Z-score: 2.0), which is significantly longer than the population average. However, the standard deviation for sleep duration (133 minutes, Z-score: 0.73) suggests some variability. The median sleep start time is late, around 12:54 AM, and the standard deviation for sleep start time (140 minutes, Z-score: 1.26) indicates considerable inconsistency in bedtime. There is a low average number of daily naps (0.08, Z-score: 0.04).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality, making a definitive placement within the top or bottom half of the PSQI distribution challenging without direct PSQI scores. However, several factors suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality, placing them more towards the **top_50** percentile.

Evidence for poorer sleep quality includes the elevated scores in depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 1.63) and moderate anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.76). These psychological states are consistently associated with impaired sleep quality. While the median sleep duration is impressively long (8 hours 47 minutes, Z-score: 2.0), indicating sufficient time in bed, the significant variability in sleep start time (140 minutes, Z-score: 1.26) points to substantial sleep schedule irregularity. This inconsistency in bedtime can disrupt the natural circadian rhythm and negatively impact sleep quality, even with adequate total sleep time. Furthermore, the participant's sedentary lifestyle, characterized by prolonged passive entertainment like watching TV and internet usage, and limited engagement in reading, could contribute to poorer sleep hygiene.

Conversely, the absence of recreational or non-prescribed drug use and moderate alcohol consumption, along with moderate exercise frequency, are positive indicators. The long sleep duration itself, if consolidated and restful, could contribute to a better PSQI score. However, the psychological burden and sleep schedule irregularity are more potent indicators of potential sleep disturbances. Considering the strong correlations between depression and anxiety with poor sleep quality, and the disruptive nature of an inconsistent sleep schedule, it is more probable that this participant’s PSQI score would fall within the **top_50** percentile, indicating poorer sleep quality compared to the study population.

54030,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that collectively inform an understanding of their sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0, Z-score of -1.07) and is classified as ""not anxious"" with a STAI trait score of 27.0 (Z-score of -1.41). Conversely, they report notably high levels of self-esteem (49.0, Z-score of 1.52), happiness (5.0, Z-score of 1.64), and trust (4.0, Z-score of 1.47). Their stress levels are slightly above average (24.0, Z-score of 0.65), and they report moderate health satisfaction (5.22, Z-score of 0.72). Behaviorally, this participant abstains from all forms of substance usage, including alcohol and recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits are primarily focused on individual activities, with a low frequency of ""Not at all"" for Exercised Alone (Z-score of -1.93), but moderate engagement in Exercised with Others and Sports (1-2 times a week for both). Daily recreational habits are characterized by higher-than-average engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.28) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95), while internet usage, listening to music, and reading are within or slightly above average ranges.

From a wearable-derived perspective, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics indicate significant intradaily variability (0.88, Z-score of 2.36), suggesting a less consolidated and potentially fragmented daily physiological pattern. This contrasts with their low interdaily stability (0.28, Z-score of -1.07) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.18, Z-score of -1.2), further pointing towards a lack of robust daily rhythmicity. Their mesor (68.6, Z-score of -0.73) and amplitude (6.78, Z-score of -1.29) are within population norms. The mean aggregate deviation from mesor data reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during late evening and nighttime hours, specifically between 10-11 PM (14.19, Z-score of 1.22) and 11 PM-12 AM (7.55, Z-score of 0.61), followed by substantial decreases in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM at -4.71, 3-4 AM at -10.65, 4-5 AM at -12.77). This nocturnal dip in heart rate, coupled with the observed sleep start time and duration, warrants careful consideration.

The participant's sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 18 minutes, which is below the population mean and falls into the lower half of the distribution (Z-score of -1.09). This duration is notably shorter than what is generally recommended for optimal functioning. Furthermore, their sleep start time is late, with a median of 02:56:44, and the standard deviation of sleep duration (143 minutes, Z-score of 0.96) indicates considerable nightly variability in sleep length. The occurrence of a mean of 0.22 daily naps (Z-score of 1.75) suggests an attempt to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

Analyzing the participant's data in relation to the PSQI score, several factors suggest a potentially poorer sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 18 minutes is significantly shorter than the population average, and the standard deviation of sleep duration indicates high variability. The late median sleep start time of approximately 3 AM is also a concern. While the participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem and happiness, these positive psychological indicators do not fully compensate for the objective and subjective reports of insufficient and variable sleep duration. The high intradaily variability in heart rate, coupled with a substantial decline during the early morning hours, might reflect a disrupted sleep architecture or an effort to maintain low physiological arousal during prolonged wakefulness. The positive correlations between certain negative psychological states (CES-D, STAI, Stress) and PSQI score, and the negative correlations between positive psychological states (Self-Esteem, Trust, Happy) and PSQI score, while not overwhelmingly strong, align with the interpretation of poorer sleep quality associated with elevated distress. Given the consistently short sleep duration, high variability in sleep duration, and late sleep onset, it is likely that this participant experiences poorer sleep quality, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution.

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.66) and anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.52), alongside a relatively high self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score of 1.38) and happiness (Happy Z-score of 1.64). Despite positive self-perceptions, the participant reports elevated stress levels (Stress Z-score of 1.19) and a notably high satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 1.8). Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine or liquor, is reported as occurring 1-2 times per week, with Z-scores suggesting this is higher than the average for the study population. Conversely, the participant reports no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity is relatively high, with exercise occurring alone and with others three times a week or more, although participation in sports is reported as not at all. Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and socializing with friends, while time spent listening to music and engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies is minimal or non-existent.

Wearable data reveal a circadian rhythm characterized by a low mesor (Mesor Z-score of -2.08) and a moderate amplitude (Amplitude Z-score of -0.4). The acrophase, or peak time, for heart rate is reported at 3:08 PM. The mean hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: -11.79, 2-3 AM: -14.66, 3-4 AM: -20.12), suggesting a period of physiological recovery. However, significant deviations above the mesor are observed during mid-morning (e.g., 8-9 AM: 15.03, 10-11 AM: 13.95) and late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 24.38, 6-7 PM: 22.33), indicating periods of increased physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is notably low (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of -1.48). Circadian rhythm regularity metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.41) and intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score of 0.17), suggesting a somewhat structured but not exceptionally rigid daily rhythm. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score of -0.87), indicating limited day-to-day predictability in the heart rate pattern. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 6 minutes, which is close to the average (Sleep Duration Z-score of -0.11), with a moderate variability in sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.47). The median sleep start time is approximately 11:24 PM, with a moderate variability in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of 0.26). The participant also reports a low frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score of 0.82), suggesting this is above average for the population.

The correlations with PSQI scores suggest that higher scores on CES-D (0.5), STAI (0.4), and Stress (0.19) are associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher Self-Esteem (-0.36), Trust (-0.21), Happiness (-0.28), and Health Satisfaction (-0.22) are associated with better sleep quality. Behavioral correlations are generally weak, with slight positive associations between substance usage and PSQI, and slight negative associations with exercise frequency.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality. On the positive side, self-reported measures of depression and anxiety are low, and self-esteem and happiness are high. They also report high health satisfaction and engage in regular exercise. Their median sleep duration is close to the population average, and their sleep start time variability is moderate.

However, several factors may contribute to a less favorable PSQI score. The positive correlation between stress levels and PSQI, coupled with a notably high stress score, is a significant concern. Furthermore, the participant's consumption of alcohol (beer and wine/liquor) is higher than the population average, and alcohol consumption is known to negatively impact sleep quality. While the physiological data shows a relatively low resting heart rate and some periods of reduced heart rate during the night, the significant deviations from the mesor during the late afternoon and early evening, along with generally elevated arousal during waking hours, could disrupt sleep. The low mesor itself, while indicating a lower average heart rate, might reflect a more generally subdued physiological state that could interact with sleep regulation. The moderate interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate suggest a less consistent daily rhythm, which can be detrimental to sleep. The positive correlations between the use of beer and wine or liquor and PSQI score, although weak, further support the potential for a higher PSQI score.

Considering the population PSQI distribution with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, a higher PSQI score indicates poorer sleep quality. The presence of elevated stress, higher than average alcohol consumption, and a less consistent circadian rhythm, despite generally positive psychological self-reports and adequate sleep duration, suggest that this participant may fall into the upper half of the PSQI distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. The positive correlations of stress and substance usage with PSQI also lean towards a higher score.

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological states and behavioral patterns that warrant detailed examination in relation to their sleep quality. Self-reported measures reveal elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 27.0, Z-score 1.42) and anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score 0.66). These findings are significant given their positive correlations with PSQI score (0.49 and 0.4, respectively), suggesting that higher levels of depression and anxiety may be associated with poorer sleep quality in this population. Conversely, the participant reports lower than average happiness (Z-score -1.61) and average self-esteem (Z-score -0.31), with modest negative correlations to PSQI, hinting that increased happiness and self-esteem may be linked to better sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, reporting beer and wine or liquor consumption 1-2 times a week, with negligible correlations to PSQI. Notably, the participant does not engage in recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits indicate moderate engagement in both solo and group exercise (1-2 times a week), with no significant correlation to sleep quality. Daily recreational habits show a high frequency of watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and substantial internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), both exhibiting small positive correlations with PSQI. Conversely, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported at lower frequencies or not at all.

Wearable data provides insights into physiological regularity and sleep patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm appears to be less stable and less regular compared to the study population, as indicated by a low Interdaily Stability value (0.24, Z-score -1.4). The Intradaily Variability (0.58, Z-score 0.24) suggests a typical level of fluctuation within the day. The Mesor (71.11, Z-score -0.39) and Amplitude (6.21, Z-score -1.48) of the heart rate rhythm are within a lower range, potentially indicating reduced physiological robustness. The Acrophase is reported at 5:40 PM, suggesting a late peak in circadian activity. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -10.37, Z-score 0.94; 4-5 AM: -12.3, Z-score 0.96; 5-6 AM: -12.7, Z-score 0.82), aligning with typical sleep periods but also indicating a more significant drop below the daily average during these times. Conversely, there is a notable increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor in the evening, particularly between 7-8 PM (16.3, Z-score 0.83) and peaking between 8-9 PM (20.14, Z-score 1.85), which could reflect periods of heightened arousal or activity before sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes, which is close to the population average, with a slightly higher standard deviation in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:19:30, with a standard deviation that suggests some variability in bedtime. The presence of daily naps (mean of 0.27, Z-score 2.27) is considerably higher than the population average, positively correlating with PSQI score, implying that napping may be associated with poorer overall sleep quality. The resting heart rate is within the average range (58.2, Z-score 0.01), providing a baseline for physiological assessment.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of this participant's data suggests a PSQI score that likely falls within the **top_50** percentile of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several indicators converge to support this conclusion. The elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score 27.0) and anxiety (STAI score 48.0) are positively correlated with PSQI scores, suggesting a direct link between these psychological states and impaired sleep. Furthermore, the participant's daily habits, specifically high engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and significant internet usage, both show small positive correlations with PSQI, potentially contributing to disrupted sleep patterns.

The wearable data reveals a less stable circadian rhythm (low Interdaily Stability) and a later sleep start time (01:19:30). The presence of daily naps (mean 0.27, Z-score 2.27), which is significantly above the population average and positively correlated with PSQI, is a strong indicator of potential sleep disturbance. While the median sleep duration is within a reasonable range, the combination of these factors, particularly the elevated psychological distress and napping behavior, points towards a greater likelihood of experiencing poor sleep quality.

Considering the population's PSQI mean of 6.72 and 75th percentile of 8.0, the presence of significant psychological distress, high internet usage, and frequent napping suggests that this participant's overall sleep quality is likely compromised and would place them in the poorer half of the distribution.

This participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by elevated psychological distress, notably high depressive symptoms, and moderate anxiety, as indicated by their CES-D and STAI scores, respectively. While self-esteem is within the average range, a low self-reported happiness score suggests a general discontent. Behaviorally, this individual reports moderate alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are relatively low, with exercise occurring infrequently (1-2 times a month for individual exercise and with others), though participation in sports is more regular (1-2 times a week). Daily sedentary habits are moderate, with significant time allocated to watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and socializing with friends.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a highly regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by high interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.33) and a pronounced acrophase around 4:49 PM. The high amplitude (Z-score: 1.28) further suggests a strong diurnal variation in heart rate. However, the intraday variability is notably low (Z-score: -1.52), which, in conjunction with the low sleep duration variability (Z-score: -0.62), points towards a potentially rigid and less adaptable physiological system. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated above the population mean (Z-score: 0.78), consistent with a resting heart rate of 58.55 bpm (Z-score: 0.05), which is within the normative range. The hourly deviation from the mesor data indicates a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (peaking between 2-5 AM), which is typical for sleep. However, this is followed by a relatively rapid increase in heart rate from mid-morning onwards, reflecting a typical diurnal pattern of increasing arousal. Notably, there are subtle positive correlations between higher deviations from the mesor in the late night and early morning and PSQI score, suggesting a potential link between disruptions in this physiological window and sleep quality.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 23 minutes, Z-score: 1.5), which would typically be considered beneficial. However, the sleep start time is considerably late (median 01:07:45 AM), and the variability in sleep start time is moderate (Z-score: -0.99). This suggests a tendency towards delayed sleep onset, which, despite the longer duration, may contribute to suboptimal sleep quality. The absence of daily naps is also noteworthy.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture concerning sleep quality. On one hand, they report a significantly longer than average sleep duration, which is generally indicative of good sleep. Furthermore, their intradaily heart rate variability is low, suggesting a stable physiological rhythm, and their resting heart rate is within the normal range. However, several factors suggest potential challenges with sleep quality. The elevated scores in depressive symptoms (CESD) and anxiety (STAI), coupled with a low self-reported happiness score, are well-established correlates of poorer sleep. Behaviorally, the late median sleep start time, despite the long duration, points to a potential issue with sleep timing and regulation. The moderate alcohol consumption might also play a role.

Considering the population's PSQI mean of 6.72 and a median of 6.0, this participant's data suggests a likelihood of their PSQI score falling within the upper half of the distribution (indicating poorer sleep quality). While specific PSQI domain scores are not provided, the strong indicators of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, low happiness) often contribute to subjective sleep complaints and objective sleep disturbances that would elevate PSQI scores. The correlation data also hints at potential relationships between certain physiological patterns during the night and PSQI score. Given the constellation of psychological distress and potential sleep timing issues, it is more probable that this participant experiences sleep quality that places them in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep.

24833,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally low level of reported psychological distress, with a CES-D score of 10.0 (Z-score: -0.34, ""Not depressed"") and an STAI-Trait score of 33.0 (Z-score: -0.82, ""not anxious""). This suggests a relatively stable psychological baseline concerning depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is reported at a score of 44.0 (Z-Score: 0.82), indicating a higher than average level of self-worth, which positively correlates with lower PSQI scores (-0.35). Trust levels are near the population mean (Score: 3.17, Z-Score: -0.14), with a slight negative correlation to PSQI score (-0.21). Self-reported happiness is also below average (Current: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53), showing a moderate negative correlation with PSQI score (-0.27). Stress levels are reported as 20.0 (Z-Score: -0.44), which is below the population mean, and show a small positive correlation with PSQI scores (0.20). Health satisfaction is notably high (Score: 5.33, Z-score: 0.8), correlating negatively with PSQI scores (-0.21), suggesting that perceived health status is associated with better sleep quality.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores indicating above-average usage for both categories (Beer Z-Score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-Score: 0.94). Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug usage are reported as ""Not at all,"" aligning with below-average population scores (Z-Scores: -0.31 and -0.11, respectively). Exercise frequency across solo, group, and sports activities falls within the 1-2 times a week range, with Z-scores indicating slightly above average engagement for sports (Sports Z-Score: 0.91) and moderate engagement for exercising alone and with others. Daily recreation habits show a pattern of moderate engagement in passive activities, with significant time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: 0.64) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.67). Internet usage is slightly below average (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: -0.49), while video game engagement is notably absent (Z-Score: -0.56). Socializing with friends is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.16), and time spent on reading and sedentary hobbies is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-Scores: 0.32 and -0.36, respectively). The correlations between these behavioral habits and PSQI scores are generally weak, suggesting limited direct impact on sleep quality as measured by the PSQI.

Analysis of wearable data reveals a highly disrupted circadian rhythm, characterized by significantly low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.17, Z-Score: -1.98) and a below-average Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.11, Z-Score: -1.79). This indicates a lack of consistent daily patterning in physiological activity. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly above average (Value: 76.86, Z-Score: 0.4), but the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly reduced (Value: 5.9, Z-Score: -1.58), suggesting a blunted daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:40 PM. Resting Heart Rate is higher than average (Value: 64.7, Z-Score: 0.78). Examination of the Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor highlights a pronounced pattern of physiological arousal during the late night and early morning hours. Specifically, significant negative deviations (indicating heart rate below the mesor) are observed from 1 AM to 7 AM, with the most substantial negative deviations occurring between 3 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-Score: 1.12, 4-5 AM Z-Score: 1.56, 5-6 AM Z-Score: 1.21). Conversely, there is a notable peak in positive deviation, indicating elevated heart rate above the mesor, between 5 PM and 6 PM (Z-Score: 0.52), and a secondary peak between 8 PM and 9 PM (Z-Score: -0.22). This pattern suggests a delayed and potentially fragmented sleep-wake cycle, with a significant period of low physiological activity during typical sleep hours and elevated activity during the late afternoon and early evening.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-Score: -0.32) and demonstrates a moderate positive correlation with PSQI score (0.05). The variability in sleep duration is also near the population average (Standard Deviation: 98 minutes, Z-Score: -0.07), with a low positive correlation to PSQI (0.2). The median sleep start time is significantly delayed at 02:10:14, with a standard deviation of 85 minutes, indicating considerable inconsistency in sleep onset (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score: 0.05, correlation: 0.18). The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-Score: -0.86) shows a negative correlation with PSQI (0.17). Overall, the data suggest a pattern of insufficient and highly irregular sleep, likely contributing to poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On the positive side, psychological distress indicators (CES-D, STAI) are low, and self-esteem is high, factors that generally correlate with better sleep quality. Health satisfaction is also high. However, several objective and subjective metrics point towards potential sleep disturbances. The median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours, while not critically low, is slightly below the population average and shows a positive correlation with PSQI scores. More concerning is the highly irregular sleep schedule, evidenced by a significantly delayed median sleep start time and notable variability in sleep onset. The wearable data further supports this, revealing a profoundly disrupted circadian rhythm with low interdaily stability and autocorrelation, coupled with reduced amplitude. The pronounced physiological arousal during typical sleep hours (late night/early morning) and reduced activity during the day suggest a dysregulated sleep-wake cycle. Although correlations are not always strong, several key factors are trending in a direction associated with poorer sleep quality: below-average sleep duration, inconsistent sleep timing, and disrupted circadian rhythmicity. Considering the population's mean PSQI score is 6.72 with a median of 6.0, and the 75th percentile at 8.0, the participant's data suggests a tendency towards a higher PSQI score. The combination of irregular sleep timing and disrupted circadian patterns are significant contributors to poor sleep quality, often reflected in higher PSQI scores. Therefore, the evidence leans towards the participant falling in the upper half of the PSQI distribution, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality.

84502,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several notable findings relevant to sleep quality. Self-report data indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 18.0 (Z=0.49), classifying them as ""Depressed."" Concurrently, their self-esteem is on the lower end of the scale, with a score of 41.0 (Z=0.4), nearing the maximum score of 40, which indicates lower self-worth. Anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, are reported as ""not anxious"" with a Z-score of -0.33. Self-reported happiness is below average, with a score of 3.0 (Z=-0.53). Trust in others is relatively high (Z=0.83), and health satisfaction is also above average (Z=0.72). Behavioral patterns reveal consistent engagement in social activities with friends (Z=-0.62) and moderate internet usage (Z=0.18). Notably, this participant abstains from all forms of substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, and reports very infrequent engagement in sports (Z=-0.42). They also engage in moderate exercise with others (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more', Z=1.23) but not alone.

Wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high interdaily stability (Value=0.55, Z=1.16) and a moderate autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value=0.42, Z=0.81). The acrophase, representing the peak in heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:08 PM. The mesor, or average heart rate, is below the population mean (Value=67.03, Z=-0.94), suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. The resting heart rate is also lower than average (Value=52.6, Z=-0.66). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a pronounced dip during the late night and early morning hours, with the most significant negative deviations observed between 1 AM and 6 AM, indicative of physiological rest during this period. Conversely, there are significant positive deviations in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM: Z=2.54, 5-6 PM: Z=2.07, 6-7 PM: Z=1.61), reflecting periods of higher physiological activity. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 31 minutes (Z=0.41), which is slightly above average. Sleep start times are relatively consistent, with a standard deviation of 65 minutes (Z=-0.39), suggesting a predictable sleep schedule. No daily naps were recorded (Z=-0.86).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely falls within the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good to average sleep quality. This conclusion is supported by several factors. Firstly, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 31 minutes, which is longer than the population median and suggests sufficient time spent asleep. The sleep start time variability is relatively low, indicating a consistent sleep schedule, a factor generally associated with better sleep quality. Furthermore, the wearable data indicates a strong circadian rhythmicity with high interdaily stability, suggesting a well-regulated daily physiological cycle. The substantial negative deviations in heart rate during the night hours further support the inference of deep sleep and rest.

While the participant does report moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 18.0), and their self-esteem is on the lower end, these self-reported psychological states, though correlated with sleep quality, do not in isolation strongly predict poor sleep on this occasion. The correlations presented do not overwhelmingly point towards a high PSQI score. For instance, while CES-D has a positive correlation with PSQI score (0.49), the participant's self-reported anxiety is low, and happiness is below average but not extreme. Notably, the absence of substance usage and the presence of regular social exercise are behaviors often associated with better well-being and potentially sleep. The relatively low resting heart rate and mesor from the wearable data could also be indicative of a generally healthy physiological state that supports good sleep. Given these factors, the evidence leans towards a PSQI score that would place them in the lower half of the distribution.

78783,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators, offering insight into their overall well-being and sleep patterns. Psychologically, the participant reports a notably low level of happiness (Z-score = -1.61), which is a significant deviation from the population mean, alongside a slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score = 0.11 for RSES, which is only slightly below the mean of 40 and suggests average self-esteem). While their current happiness is low, their scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D, Z-score = -0.03) and chronic anxiety (STAI, Z-score = 0.17) are within the population norm, suggesting that their low happiness may not be indicative of clinical depression or pervasive anxiety. Furthermore, their stress levels are slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17). Their self-reported health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score = -1.11), indicating a potential area of concern for their overall well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of social activities, with 2-3 hours spent socializing with friends daily (Z-score = 0.95), and exercises three times a week or more alone (Z-score = 1.07), indicating consistent physical activity. However, their engagement in video games is substantially higher than the average participant (Z-score = 1.71), suggesting a potential significant time commitment to this leisure activity. They report infrequent use of alcohol (1-2 times a month) and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Their academic performance, as reflected by their GPA, is generally good, with a trend of improvement over successive semesters.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant exhibits a relatively regular circadian rhythm, characterized by a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.41) and a typical intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.24). Their mesor (mean heart rate), while below population average (Z-score = -0.58), is within a reasonable range, as is their resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.64), suggesting a physically fit baseline. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significant cardiovascular arousal in the late evening and early morning hours. Notably, the deviation from the mesor is highest between 3-4 AM (-12.49) and 4-5 AM (-14.79), and also shows marked increases between 10-11 PM (16.47) and 7-8 PM (17.32). This suggests that the participant's cardiovascular system is less regulated during these periods, potentially reflecting attempts to fall asleep or being disturbed during sleep.

Regarding sleep itself, the participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours and 52 minutes, which is slightly below the population mean (suggested by a Z-score of -0.39). More concerning is the high variability in their sleep duration (Z-score = 1.13) and a notably inconsistent sleep start time, with a standard deviation of 173 minutes (Z-score = 1.99). This considerable variability in sleep onset, coupled with a median sleep start time of 02:51 AM, indicates significant sleep irregularity. The participant also reports an average of 0.26 daily naps, which is substantially higher than the population average (Z-score = 2.23), potentially indicating a need to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, appears to be in the lower half of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While the participant's median sleep duration is slightly less than ideal and their sleep start times are highly variable, these factors do not strongly correlate with higher PSQI scores based on the provided correlations. The high variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.13) has a moderate positive correlation (0.2) with PSQI score, suggesting it might contribute to poorer sleep quality. Similarly, the high standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score = 1.99) has a moderate positive correlation (0.18) with PSQI score. The frequent napping (Z-score = 2.23) also shows a modest positive correlation (0.17) with PSQI, further suggesting a potential impact on sleep quality.

However, several factors point towards better-than-average sleep quality. The participant's CES-D and STAI scores are within the population norms, indicating no significant presence of depressive symptoms or chronic anxiety, which are typically associated with poorer sleep. Their relatively low stress levels (Z-score = -0.17) and above-average socializing with friends (Z-score = 0.95) may contribute positively to sleep. Furthermore, their consistently low resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.64) and mesor (Z-score = -0.58) suggest a healthy cardiovascular system, which can be indicative of good physical well-being and potentially better sleep. The low correlation of many other behavioral and physiological metrics with PSQI score also suggests that these factors are not severely impacting their sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Given the moderate positive correlations of sleep duration variability, sleep start time variability, and napping with PSQI, these aspects indicate a potential for slightly poorer sleep quality, but not necessarily in the top 50% of the distribution.

Considering the totality of the evidence, while there are areas for improvement in sleep consistency (duration and start time) and napping habits, the absence of significant psychological distress and the presence of other favorable physiological and behavioral indicators suggest that the participant's overall PSQI score likely falls within the bottom 50% of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

25197,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant presents with a profile characterized by elevated chronic anxiety and stress, with a significant positive Z-score for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Z=0.86) and stress (Z=0.92), suggesting these traits are more pronounced relative to the study population. While self-reported depressive symptoms are within the non-depressed range (CESD Z=-0.34), and trust and happiness are slightly below average (Trust Z=-0.14, Happy Z=-0.53), the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z=1.63). Regarding lifestyle, substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is above average (Z=1.01 and Z=0.94 respectively), though recreational and non-prescribed drug use is not reported. Exercise frequency, particularly sports participation, is below average (Sports Z=-0.42). Daily recreational habits indicate lower engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z=-1.25) and socializing with friends (Z=-0.62), while moderate engagement is observed in video games, internet usage, listening to music, and reading.

The wearable data reveals a relatively lower resting heart rate (RHR=52.4, Z=-0.68), suggesting a potentially good baseline cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates moderate interdaily stability (IS=0.42, Z=0.09) and low intradaily variability (IV=0.47, Z=-0.53), pointing towards a somewhat regular but not highly variable daily physiological rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate) is below the population average (Mesor=67.71, Z=-0.85), while the amplitude of the rhythm is above average (Amplitude=12.77, Z=0.64), suggesting a greater swing between peak and trough heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 4:02 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight a notable pattern of physiological arousal in the afternoon, with significant positive deviations during the 3-4 PM (Z=5.3) and 4-5 PM (Z=1.48) hours, and also from 2-3 PM (Z=1.42). Conversely, heart rate is notably lower than the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z=-0.82; 3-4 AM, Z=-0.7; 4-5 AM, Z=-0.67). This pattern of afternoon arousal and nocturnal suppression is consistent with a typical diurnal rhythm, but the pronounced afternoon peak warrants attention.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average (Z=-0.77), and a lower than average standard deviation for sleep duration (Z=-0.91), suggesting consistent, albeit shorter, sleep. The median sleep start time is late at 1:45 AM, with moderate variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z=-0.58). The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z=-0.86) suggests a reliance on nighttime sleep. The correlation coefficients for most survey and wearable metrics with the PSQI score are relatively weak, suggesting that no single factor strongly dictates sleep quality in this dataset. However, the positive correlations with STAI (0.4), Stress (0.2), and substance usage (Beer: 0.03, Wine/Liquor: 0.06) and negative correlations with Self-Esteem (-0.35), Health Satisfaction (-0.21), Happy (-0.27), and Trust (-0.21) suggest that psychological factors and lifestyle choices may play a role in sleep quality. The moderate positive correlation between sleep duration standard deviation and PSQI (0.2) suggests that less consistent sleep durations may be associated with poorer sleep quality.

Based on the provided data, this participant's sleep quality as measured by the PSQI likely falls in the bottom 50% of the study population. This is supported by several indicators: a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average, and a higher than average amplitude in heart rate rhythm, which can sometimes be associated with poorer sleep. The participant also exhibits elevated levels of anxiety and stress, which are commonly linked to diminished sleep quality. While their physiological arousal patterns show some regularity, the significant afternoon peak in heart rate could indicate a disruption in the expected diurnal pattern that might negatively impact sleep onset or maintenance. Furthermore, the stronger correlation of negative psychological indicators (anxiety, stress) with PSQI, and protective factors (self-esteem, happiness) with negative correlations, imply a potential for poorer sleep. The consistent, but shorter, sleep duration, alongside a late sleep start time, suggests an overall pattern that leans towards suboptimal sleep.

This participant exhibits a complex profile across psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics, which collectively inform an understanding of their sleep quality. In terms of psychological well-being, their scores suggest a moderate level of anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.56), which is slightly above the study population mean. Conversely, they report not being depressed (CES-D Z-score: -0.24) and possess a near-average level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.17). Their reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy Z-score: 0.55), though this is paired with a below-average score for trust in others (Trust Z-score: -0.46). Notably, stress levels are relatively low for the study population (Stress Z-score: -0.71).

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a significant commitment to physical activity. They exercise alone ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.07) and engage in sports ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.58), indicating a robust regimen. Their engagement with others in exercise is less frequent, reported as ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.53). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, placing them at the lower end of usage within the population (e.g., Beer Z-score: -1.12). Their daily recreational habits lean towards lower screen time activities, with ""Do not do"" reported for watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music, and a moderate ""1-2 hours"" for internet usage. Socializing with friends is infrequent (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.41), and sedentary hobbies are also not engaged in. This pattern suggests a lifestyle prioritizing physical activity and avoiding passive consumption.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant displays a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.38, Z-score: -0.24) and Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.6, Z-score: 0.39) suggest a moderate degree of regularity in daily activity patterns, though not exceptionally high. The Mesor (Value: 69.51, Z-score: -0.61) indicates a resting heart rate that is somewhat lower than the population average, which is consistent with their robust exercise habits. The Acrophase occurring at ""2:42 PM"" signifies the peak of their circadian rhythm. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals significant patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. Notably, there are substantial negative deviations (indicating heart rate below the Mesor) during late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 am and 6 am (e.g., 1-2 am: -16.42, Z-score: -1.23; 2-3 am: -19.13, Z-score: -0.91). Conversely, the participant exhibits marked positive deviations (heart rate above the Mesor) during late morning and early afternoon hours, with the highest positive deviation observed between 9-10 am (19.65, Z-score: 2.06) and 10-11 am (18.25, Z-score: 1.92). These patterns suggest a physiological response consistent with being awake and active during the day and at rest during the night, albeit with a potentially significant increase in heart rate during morning hours.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality, necessitating a holistic interpretation. On one hand, several factors suggest a potentially lower PSQI score, indicating better sleep quality. Their engagement in frequent exercise (""Three times a week or more"" for sports and exercising alone) and their absence of substance use are generally associated with improved sleep. Their low reported stress levels (Z-score: -0.71) also contribute to a favorable sleep profile. Furthermore, their reported happiness is above average (Z-score: 0.55), and their CES-D score indicates they are not depressed (Z-score: -0.24). The wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with a low resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.39) and a Mesor below the population average, suggesting good physiological regulation. Crucially, their median sleep duration is significantly longer than the population mean (8 hours 49 minutes, Z-score: 2.03), and the standard deviation for sleep duration is within a reasonable range (94 minutes, Z-score: -0.15), implying consistent sleep duration.

On the other hand, a few elements could contribute to a higher PSQI score, indicating poorer sleep quality. The participant reports being ""anxious"" (STAI Z-score: 0.56), which can negatively impact sleep. While their overall sleep duration is ample, the physiological data shows substantial heart rate deviations from their Mesor during the night, particularly between 1 am and 6 am, with the most negative deviation observed between 11 pm and 12 am (-10.72, Z-score: -2.11) and 12 am and 1 am (-15.19, Z-score: -1.9). This could indicate periods of wakefulness or restless sleep during these hours. Additionally, the acrophase occurring at 2:42 PM suggests a late circadian peak, which might be misaligned with typical social schedules, though the data doesn't directly quantify this impact on sleep onset.

Weighing these factors, the significantly longer sleep duration and the absence of substance use, coupled with low stress and good exercise habits, lean towards better sleep quality. The higher anxiety score and the notable negative heart rate deviations during the night are concerning but do not appear to outweigh the positive indicators, particularly the ample sleep duration. Considering the PSQI population parameters (50th percentile: 6.0), this participant's data, especially the extended sleep duration, suggests they are likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

The participant presents with a complex profile, characterized by elevated psychological distress alongside specific behavioral patterns and physiological markers. Notably, self-reported measures indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and moderate levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86). These psychological factors are positively correlated with poor sleep quality, with the CES-D score showing a substantial correlation of 0.49. Stress levels are also high (Stress score of 29.0, Z-score 2.01), further contributing to a potentially negative psychological state. In contrast, self-esteem appears within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 39.0, Z-Score 0.11), and trust levels are lower than the population mean (Trust Z-Score -1.74). Happiness is reported as slightly above average (Happy Z-Score 0.55), and satisfaction with physical health is somewhat lower than average (Health Satisfaction Z-score -0.95).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, with associated Z-scores indicating above-average usage compared to the study population. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise habits include exercising alone three times a week or more, which is above the population average (Exercised Alone Z-Score 1.07), and exercising with others 1-2 times a week. However, engagement in sports is infrequent. Daily recreational activities show a pattern of moderate internet usage (2-3 hours), while time spent on sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, and reading is minimal. Socializing with friends is also reported as a shorter duration activity. These recreational patterns, particularly the higher internet usage, do not strongly correlate with sleep quality.

Physiologically, as indicated by Fitbit data, the participant exhibits a relatively lower resting heart rate (Value 53.0, Z-Score -0.61), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a notably lower interdaily stability (Value 0.34, Z-Score -0.57) and a lower autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value 0.24, Z-Score -0.7), indicating a less regular and predictable daily rhythm in heart rate. The mesor (average heart rate) and amplitude of the circadian rhythm are also lower than the population average, suggesting a dampened overall cardiovascular oscillation. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:03 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of significant physiological arousal in the late evening (e.g., 7-8 PM showing a deviation of 17.41, Z-Score 1.03) and subsequent dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM deviation of -18.11, Z-Score -0.28). This pattern of evening arousal followed by deep nocturnal dips may suggest a dysregulated sleep-wake cycle.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours (6 hours 57 minutes), which is close to the population average, but with a higher standard deviation (159 minutes), suggesting variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is late at 1:44 AM, with a standard deviation of 99 minutes, further reinforcing the notion of irregular sleep timing. The prevalence of daily naps is low. The correlations between these sleep metrics and PSQI score are generally weak, with a slight positive correlation observed for sleep duration standard deviation (0.2) and sleep start time standard deviation (0.18), and mean daily naps (0.17), suggesting that greater variability in sleep and napping may be associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents several indicators that suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality, placing them in the upper half of the PSQI distribution. The elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 1.11) and anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.86), coupled with high stress levels (Stress Z-score 2.01), are all known contributors to impaired sleep quality and are positively correlated with PSQI scores. The significant correlations of 0.49 with CES-D and 0.4 with STAI directly link these psychological states to poorer sleep.

Behaviorally, while exercise habits are somewhat positive, the overall pattern of recreational habits, including moderate internet usage and minimal engagement in other restorative activities, does not strongly counter these negative psychological influences.

Physiologically, the reduced interdaily stability and autocorrelation of heart rate suggest a less regulated circadian rhythm, which is intrinsically linked to sleep-wake cycles. While the resting heart rate is low, the pattern of evening arousal and subsequent deep nocturnal dips in heart rate, along with a late median sleep start time and significant variability in sleep duration and start times, all point towards a disrupted sleep architecture. The positive correlations of sleep duration and start time standard deviations with PSQI suggest that this variability directly contributes to poorer sleep quality.

Considering the confluence of significant psychological distress, less regulated circadian rhythmicity, and marked variability in sleep timing and duration, it is likely that this participant experiences a PSQI score that falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

67192,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with notable psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant detailed examination in relation to their sleep quality. Self-report data indicates elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 32.0, Z-score 1.95) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 58.0, Z-score 1.65). These psychological distress markers are accompanied by significantly lower self-esteem (RSES score of 33.0, Z-score -0.73) and lower perceived trust in others (Trust score of 2.0, Z-score -2.39). Furthermore, self-reported happiness is also lower than average (Happy score of 2.0, Z-score -1.61). Academically, the participant's GPA has declined, with a recent Fall 2016 GPA of 2.02 compared to a Fall 2015 GPA of 3.17, suggesting potential academic struggles. Stress levels are reported as high (Stress score of 31.0, Z-score 2.55), and health satisfaction is low (Health Satisfaction score of 1.56, Z-score -2.03).

Behaviorally, substance use includes moderate consumption of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week) while beer and recreational/non-prescribed drugs are not used. Physical activity is moderate, with exercising alone and with others occurring 1-2 times a week, but engagement in sports is notably absent. Daily recreation habits are characterized by substantial engagement in screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours), playing video games (1-2 hours), and general internet usage (2-3 hours). Listening to music also occupies 2-3 hours daily. Notably, the participant reports socializing with friends for over 4 hours daily, a significantly high amount compared to the population. Reading and sedentary hobbies are not reported.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals a higher than average resting heart rate (71.8 bpm, Z-score 1.62) and a significantly elevated Mesor (88.67, Z-score 2.01), suggesting a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activity. The mesor is particularly elevated during the late evening and nighttime hours, with the largest deviations from the mesor occurring between 10-11 PM (16.29) and 3-4 AM (-17.10). This pattern suggests a potential disruption in the typical diurnal heart rate rhythm. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates moderate interdaily stability (0.52, Z-score 0.91) and intradaily variability (0.5, Z-score -0.32), with a somewhat elevated autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, Z-score 1.23), suggesting some regularity but also potential fluctuations in daily patterns. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 5:12 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes, which is close to the population average with a low Z-score of 0.1. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively high (108 minutes, Z-score 0.16), suggesting variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late at 1:15 AM, with a standard deviation of 110 minutes, indicating significant inconsistency in sleep onset timing. The mean daily nap frequency is slightly elevated at 0.13. The positive correlations observed between higher CES-D, STAI, and Stress scores with PSQI, and negative correlations with Self-Esteem, Trust, and Health Satisfaction, along with moderate positive correlations with sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability, suggest that psychological distress and behavioral inconsistencies may contribute to poorer sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the provided data, the participant exhibits several indicators that suggest their overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is likely to fall in the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. The significant psychological distress, including high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, coupled with low self-esteem and trust, are strongly correlated with higher PSQI scores. These psychological factors are known contributors to sleep disturbances. Furthermore, the observed variability in sleep start times and sleep duration, despite a seemingly adequate median sleep duration, suggests a lack of sleep consistency, another factor associated with poorer sleep quality. The elevated resting heart rate and Mesor, along with the late sleep start time, also point towards physiological patterns that may not be conducive to optimal sleep. While some metrics like median sleep duration are close to the population average, the constellation of psychological and behavioral indicators, alongside sleep timing inconsistency, strongly suggests a deviation towards the poorer end of the sleep quality spectrum.

This participant presents with a relatively low baseline level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0, Z-score -1.07) and a non-anxious disposition (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score -0.82). Their self-esteem is within the typical range, with a score of 41.0 (Z-score 0.4) on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and they report moderate happiness (Z-score -0.53). Trust in others is notably higher than average, with a score of 4.0 (Z-score 1.47). While stress levels are not exceptionally high (Score 20.0, Z-score -0.44), their health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score 3.67, Z-score -0.45).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, reporting usage of beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores indicating this is more frequent than the study average. They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are mixed; they exercise alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), which is above average, but they do not exercise with others (Z-score -1.58) and do not participate in sports (Z-score -1.09). Daily recreational habits show a tendency towards sedentary activities. They spend 16-30 minutes watching TV/videos/movies and engaging in sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is moderate (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.49). Notably, they report not listening to music and engaging in video games, activities with notably negative Z-scores suggesting infrequent engagement. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours (Z-score 0.16), and they engage in reading for 16-30 minutes (Z-score 1.3), indicating a higher than average engagement with reading.

Wearable data reveals a stable circadian rhythm, with an interdaily stability of 0.53 (Z-score 1.0) and an intradaily variability of 0.54 (Z-score -0.04). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.46 (Z-score 1.15), further supporting a structured daily rhythm. The mesor, a measure of average heart rate, is 72.79 bpm (Z-score -0.16), indicating a slightly lower than average resting heart rate. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 14.78 bpm (Z-score 1.29), suggesting a notable fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, is around 5:00 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of lower-than-average heart rate during the night and early morning, particularly between 1:00 AM and 8:00 AM, with pronounced deviations between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM (reaching -28.16 bpm at 5-6 AM). Conversely, there are significant peaks in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and evening, with particularly strong positive deviations observed between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM (2.23 Z-score), 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM (2.1 Z-score), and 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM (2.14 Z-score). These patterns suggest a physiological arousal peak in the evening, which could potentially impact sleep onset.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score 0.02), which is close to the population mean. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 63 minutes (Z-score -0.86), suggesting relatively consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is at 1:44 AM, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is 63 minutes (Z-score -0.43), indicating some variability in sleep onset. The participant naps infrequently, with a mean of 0.13 naps per day (Z-score 0.7), which is slightly higher than average.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score distribution appears to lean towards the lower half of the population. Several factors support this assessment. Their low CES-D and STAI scores indicate a lack of significant depressive and anxious symptoms, which are commonly associated with poor sleep quality. Their above-average self-esteem and moderate happiness levels further suggest a generally positive psychological state that is conducive to good sleep. While their health satisfaction is slightly below average, this is not a strong indicator of poor sleep quality.

Behaviorally, the participant's consistent engagement in solitary exercise and moderate reading habits are positive indicators. Although they do not exercise with others or participate in sports, and their recreational activities lean towards sedentary, the overall pattern does not strongly suggest behaviors that would detrimentally impact sleep quality. The moderate alcohol consumption is a potential, albeit minor, concern but is unlikely to be a dominant factor in poor sleep given the other positive indicators.

The wearable data reveals a robust circadian rhythm with good stability and predictability. The patterned deviations in heart rate, with lower rates during the night and higher rates in the late afternoon and evening, suggest a normal physiological cycle that, while showing evening arousal, does not present extreme abnormalities. The sleep duration is within the average range, and the variability in sleep duration is not substantial.

Correlations between the examined metrics and PSQI scores are generally weak, with most values close to zero. The small positive correlations between lower heart rate deviations during sleep hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM) and PSQI score, and the small negative correlations between higher heart rate deviations in the afternoon and evening (e.g., 9-10 AM, 10-11 AM, 2-3 PM) and PSQI score, suggest that deviations from the norm in these areas might be associated with slightly poorer sleep quality. However, the magnitudes of these correlations are not strong enough to definitively indicate poor sleep quality.

Considering the constellation of these factors – predominantly positive psychological and behavioral indicators, a stable circadian rhythm, and average sleep duration – it is most likely that this participant falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

67177,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a complex psychological and behavioral profile that warrants a nuanced interpretation in relation to their sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a tendency towards elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16.0, Z=0.28) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 46.0, Z=0.46), with a moderately low self-esteem (Self-Esteem score of 31.0, Z=-1.01). These findings, while not reaching clinically significant thresholds for all metrics, suggest a potential underlying psychological vulnerability that could impact sleep. The participant reports a low level of general happiness (Current happiness score of 2.0, Z=-1.61), which aligns with the reported feelings of depression and anxiety. Notably, the participant exhibits high stress levels (Stress score of 25.0, Z=0.92), a factor strongly correlated with poorer sleep quality. Health satisfaction is reported as low (Score of 2.67, Z=-1.2), and trust in others is also low (Score of 2.67, Z=-1.1).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in minimal physical activity, reporting no frequency of exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, as indicated by highly negative Z-scores for these activities. In terms of daily recreational habits, there is a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28) and using the internet (2-3 hours, Z=0.85), along with moderate listening to music (2-3 hours, Z=1.13). Activities such as video games, reading, sedentary hobbies, and socializing with friends are reported as infrequent or non-existent. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, with corresponding negative Z-scores indicating a lack of engagement in these behaviors. The participant's Body Mass Index is noted at 30.04, placing them within the obese category, which is often associated with sleep disturbances.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits some regularity, with an Interdaily Stability value of 0.56 (Z=1.24) indicating a moderate degree of consistency in daily activity patterns. However, the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of 0.49 (Z=1.4) suggests a weaker daily rhythmicity compared to a typical population. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is elevated at 82.08 bpm (Z=1.11), and the Amplitude of 13.32 bpm (Z=0.82) suggests a notable fluctuation around this elevated mean. The Acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is reported at 4:34 PM, which is within a normal range but contributes to the overall cardiovascular profile. The resting heart rate is also elevated at 65.2 bpm (Z=0.84). Analysis of the Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor reveals distinct hourly patterns. Notably, during the late evening and early morning hours (12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), heart rate consistently deviates below the mesor by approximately 10-20 beats per minute. Conversely, there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation from the mesor in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 5-6 PM (17.77 bpm, Z=1.06) and 7-8 PM (17.35 bpm, Z=1.02), suggesting increased physiological arousal during these times.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 54 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z=-0.35), and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (100 minutes, Z=-0.01) suggesting consistent, albeit potentially insufficient, sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is late at 00:22:06, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (87 minutes, Z=0.08), indicating some variability in when the participant initiates sleep. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps value of 0.0, Z=-0.86) further supports a pattern of consolidated, though potentially fragmented, nocturnal sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents several indicators that are frequently associated with poorer sleep quality, suggesting a PSQI score likely in the upper half of the distribution. The elevated CES-D and STAI scores, alongside low self-esteem and happiness, point to a psychological state that can negatively impact sleep. High stress levels, in particular, have a strong positive correlation with PSQI scores, indicating that increased stress likely leads to a higher, thus worse, PSQI score. The participant's sedentary lifestyle, characterized by extensive screen time and minimal physical activity, also contributes to an increased likelihood of poor sleep. Furthermore, the physiological data reveals an elevated resting heart rate and mesor, along with distinct patterns of heart rate deviation that might indicate physiological dysregulation during nighttime hours. While the median sleep duration is not drastically short, the late sleep onset and the overall psychological and behavioral profile suggest a pattern that aligns with a higher PSQI score.

Considering the population's PSQI mean of 6.72 and 75th percentile of 8.0, a PSQI score above 6.0 would place the participant in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality. The confluence of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, low happiness), high stress, sedentary habits, and elevated physiological arousal markers collectively suggest that this participant is more likely to experience poorer sleep quality, thus falling into the top 50% of the PSQI distribution.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by notably low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, as indicated by significantly low Z-scores for the CES-D (-1.38) and STAI (-1.81) respectively. This is further supported by a high self-esteem score (Z-score of 1.66) and a positive self-perception of happiness (Z-score of 1.64). Conversely, their reported stress level is low (Z-score of -1.8), and their trust in others is within the average range (Z-score of -0.46). Health satisfaction is also reported as relatively low (Z-score of -1.2). The participant engages in no substance usage, with Z-scores for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs all indicating minimal or no usage. Regarding exercise, they report engaging in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.91), which is above average, but less frequent solitary or group exercise. Daily recreational habits show a significant tendency towards sedentary activities, with high time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 2.54), playing video games (Z-score of 1.71), and listening to music (Z-score of 1.6), alongside substantial social interaction (Z-score of 2.53) and reading (Z-score of 2.28).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a robust circadian rhythm with high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.0) and moderate autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.57), suggesting a regular daily pattern. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm, representing the peak of heart rate, occurs at 5:40 PM, aligning with typical diurnal patterns. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.34), while the amplitude, representing the extent of daily variation, is notably high (Z-score of 1.78), suggesting significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pronounced dip during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -20.27 to -26.44), indicative of physiological rest. A significant increase in heart rate deviation is observed in the evening, particularly between 6-7 PM (27.64) and 10-11 PM (16.11), suggesting a period of higher physiological arousal preceding sleep. The participant's resting heart rate is lower than average (Z-score of -0.45).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes, which is slightly above the population average, with a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of -0.57), suggesting consistent sleep lengths. However, the median sleep start time is quite late at 01:26:15 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score of -0.72), indicating some variability in sleep onset. The frequency of daily naps is slightly above average (Z-score of 1.21). The correlations with PSQI scores, while generally weak, suggest that higher CES-D and STAI scores are moderately associated with poorer sleep quality, while higher self-esteem and trust are weakly associated with better sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the available data, there is evidence suggesting that this participant may have a PSQI score that falls within the lower half of the distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The participant reports no substance usage, engages in regular sports activities, and has a good overall psychological profile characterized by low depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes is adequate. While the sleep start time is late, the consistency in sleep duration suggests a structured, albeit shifted, sleep schedule. The high amplitude in heart rate variability could indicate a robust physiological response to daily activities, and the observed dip in heart rate during typical sleep hours points to physiological rest.

Conversely, the late sleep start time and a moderate standard deviation in sleep onset could contribute to slightly poorer sleep quality. The high engagement in sedentary recreational activities like watching TV and playing video games, along with a moderate amount of socializing and reading before bed, might indirectly influence sleep onset and quality, as suggested by some positive correlations with PSQI score for certain sedentary habits. The relatively low health satisfaction could also be an indicator of broader well-being that might influence sleep.

However, the overwhelmingly positive psychological indicators, coupled with adequate sleep duration and no substance use, lean the interpretation towards better sleep quality. The PSQI population mean is 6.72, with a 50th percentile of 6.0. A PSQI score below 6.0 is generally considered good quality sleep. Given the lack of significant negative indicators related to sleep habits and psychological distress, it is plausible that this participant's overall PSQI score is at or below the median.

49497,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile with notable implications for sleep quality. Self-report measures indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 49.0, Z-score of 3.71), high levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 64.0, Z-score of 2.24), and low self-esteem (Self-Esteem score of 22.0, Z-score of -2.28). Concurrently, reported happiness is low (Current happiness score of 2.0, Z-score of -1.61), and trust in others is also reduced (Trust score of 2.5, Z-score of -1.42). These psychological indicators are generally positively correlated with the PSQI score, suggesting a potential negative impact on sleep quality.

Behaviorally, the participant reports relatively frequent substance usage, including alcohol (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a week) and recreational drugs (1-2 times a week), with particularly high Z-scores for recreational drug usage (Z-score of 5.44), indicating this is a significant deviation from the study population. Exercise habits are mixed, with regular solo exercise (Three times a week or more) but no exercise with others. Daily recreational habits suggest significant time spent on internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score of 1.52) and listening to music (31 minutes to an hour), while time spent socializing with friends is low (16-30 minutes, Z-score of -1.41). These behavioral patterns, particularly high internet usage and low social interaction, may contribute to disruptions in sleep hygiene.

Wearable data reveals a moderately irregular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is low (0.21, Z-score of -1.65), suggesting a lack of consistent daily patterning in cardiovascular activity. While Intradaily Variability is higher (0.63, Z-score of 0.6), indicating some fluctuation within the day, the overall stability is compromised. The Mesor (75.64, Z-score of 0.23) and Amplitude (5.95, Z-score of -1.56) suggest a relatively standard daily amplitude but a slightly elevated average heart rate. The Acrophase at 3:05 PM indicates the peak heart rate occurs in the mid-afternoon. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals elevated heart rates during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 9-10am, 10-11am, 11am-12pm) and significantly depressed heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5am, 5-6am, 6-7am), which is generally expected but the magnitude of deviation in the early morning could reflect periods of deep sleep or prolonged inactivity.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate suboptimal sleep. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 30 minutes (Z-score of -0.85), which is below average for the population. The variability in sleep duration is also higher than average (Standard Deviation of 148 minutes, Z-score of 1.06). Most notably, the median sleep start time is very late at 1:14 AM, with a high standard deviation (204 minutes, Z-score of 2.65), suggesting significant irregularity in the timing of sleep onset. This late and variable sleep schedule, coupled with the underlying psychological distress and behavioral patterns, strongly suggests a detrimental impact on overall sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant presents with several indicators strongly associated with poor sleep quality, aligning them towards the upper half of the PSQI distribution. The exceptionally high CES-D score, indicative of significant depressive symptom burden, is positively correlated with PSQI score (0.49). Similarly, high anxiety levels (STAI, correlation 0.4) and low self-esteem (correlation -0.35) are also associated with poorer sleep. Behaviorally, the reported high frequency of recreational drug use (though correlation with PSQI is low at 0.08) alongside significant internet usage and low social interaction could disrupt sleep hygiene.

Physiologically, the low interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score of -1.65, correlation -0.06) points to a lack of consistent daily rhythm, a factor often linked to disrupted sleep. The late and highly variable sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of 2.65, correlation 0.17) are direct contributors to poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes (Z-score of -0.85, correlation 0.06) suggests insufficient sleep, which is a core component of poor sleep quality. While some metrics like Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.29, correlation 0.12) and Mesor (Z-score 0.23, correlation 0.06) are within population norms or slightly elevated, the overall pattern of psychological distress, behavioral irregularities, and objective sleep timing disruptions strongly suggests a PSQI score in the top 50th percentile, indicative of relatively poor sleep quality.

33785,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant presents with a complex psychological and behavioral profile that warrants careful consideration in the context of sleep quality assessment. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 27.0, Z-score 1.42) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 56.0, Z-score 1.45) are notable, correlating positively with PSQI score, suggesting a potential impact on sleep. Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 32.0, Z-score -0.87), and trust levels are also average (Score of 3.17, Z-score -0.14). Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Current happiness score of 4.0, Z-score 0.55), while stress levels are below average (Score of 19.0, Z-score -0.71). Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Score of 4.78, Z-score 0.38).

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (beer 1-2 times a month, wine or liquor less than 1-2 times a month) and reports no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise frequency is notable, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), contrasting with infrequent exercise with others (1-2 times a month) and no participation in sports. Daily recreational activities show a significant engagement in video gaming (1-2 hours daily, Z-score 2.47) and prolonged sedentary hobbies (2-3 hours daily, Z-score 2.01), alongside moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18). Listening to music and socializing with friends occupy less than an hour per day, and reading is done for 16-30 minutes daily. These high levels of sedentary leisure activities and prolonged screen time, particularly video gaming, may be associated with disrupted sleep patterns.

The wearable-derived data provides insights into physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. The participant exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Value 0.48, Z-score 0.58) and notably low intradaily variability (Value 0.25, Z-score -2.08) in heart rate, suggesting a relatively stable, albeit potentially less dynamic, daily physiological cycle. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also moderately high (Value 0.45, Z-score 1.06), indicating some degree of regularity in the circadian rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is slightly elevated (76.81 bpm, Z-score 0.39), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also above average (12.46, Z-score 0.54), suggesting a wider range of heart rate variation throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:49 PM). The resting heart rate is within the average range (58.7 bpm, Z-score 0.07). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am deviation of -19.98, Z-score -0.58; 5-6 am deviation of -23.45, Z-score -0.74), which is expected during sleep. Conversely, higher heart rates are observed in the late evening (10-11 pm deviation of 14.02, Z-score 1.19) and later at night (8-9 pm deviation of 12.26, Z-score 0.46), which could indicate periods of physiological arousal or stress impacting sleep onset and maintenance.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes (Z-score 0.18), which is slightly above average. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 110 minutes (Z-score 0.2), suggesting some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is late at 00:39:28, with a standard deviation of 49 minutes (Z-score -0.75), indicating a relatively consistent, albeit late, bedtime. The average daily naps are negligible (0.07, Z-score -0.08). The positive correlations between higher CES-D and STAI scores with the PSQI score, coupled with late sleep onset and significant engagement in sedentary screen-based activities, suggest potential challenges to optimal sleep quality.

Overall, considering the elevated levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, the significant engagement in sedentary screen-based activities, and the observed pattern of increased heart rate in the late evening which may disrupt sleep, this participant likely experiences compromised sleep quality. While the median sleep duration is adequate, the other contributing factors, particularly the psychological distress and behavioral patterns, suggest that their PSQI score would fall in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality relative to the study population.

This participant demonstrates a generally lower than population average level of chronic anxiety as indicated by their STAI score (Z-score: -0.13), and also reports a lower than average burden of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.45). They also report higher than average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.26) and happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53), alongside a lower than average reported stress level (Stress Z-score: -0.71). Trust in others is reported slightly below average (Trust Z-score: -0.46), as is health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.45). Regarding substance usage, this participant reports drinking wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is higher than the population average (Wine or Liquor Z-Score: 0.94), while their beer consumption is closer to average (Beer Z-Score: 0.3). They report not using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week both alone and with others, and sports participation 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational habits indicate relatively low engagement with screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and a notable absence of listening to music. Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported in the 1-2 hour range. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged with for 15 minutes or less, which is lower than average for sedentary hobbies (Sedentary Hobby Z-Score: -0.36).

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits lower than average mesor (Mesor Z-score: -0.71) and amplitude (Amplitude Z-score: -0.92) in their heart rate, suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal level. Their resting heart rate is at the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.01). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate lower than average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.49) and higher than average intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.53), suggesting a less regular daily pattern in heart rate. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also below average (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-Score: -0.45), reinforcing the notion of a less structured circadian rhythm. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, with the lowest points occurring between 2-5 AM (e.g., 3-4am Z-score: 0.37, 4-5am Z-score: 0.56). Heart rate deviations increase in the late morning and afternoon, peaking around 10-11 AM (10-11am Z-score: 0.92) and again in the mid-afternoon (3-4pm Z-score: 0.43). Evening hours from 7 PM onwards show a decrease in heart rate deviation from the mesor, with the lowest points occurring between 8-10 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.89) and a lower than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score: -1.03), suggesting consistent sleep length. The median sleep start time is around 12:51 AM, which is later than average, and the standard deviation of sleep start times is also lower than average (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score: -0.61), indicating a relatively consistent sleep onset time. The participant also reports no daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-Score: -0.86), which is below the population average.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators that suggest the participant is likely to fall within the **bottom 50%** of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

Firstly, the participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile with lower than average anxiety and depressive symptoms, and higher than average self-esteem, happiness, and lower stress levels. These psychological factors are often associated with better sleep quality. While there is a positive correlation between CESD scores and PSQI (0.49), this participant's CESD score is below average. Similarly, STAI scores correlate with PSQI (0.4), but this participant's anxiety scores are also below average. The correlation between stress and PSQI is moderate (0.2), and this participant reports lower stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a notable absence of excessive screen time in the form of watching TV/videos/movies and video games, which are often linked to poorer sleep. Their consistent sleep duration, as indicated by the longer than average median sleep duration and low standard deviation, and a relatively consistent sleep start time, are positive indicators of sleep quality. The lack of daily naps also aligns with better sleep hygiene. While their sleep onset time is later than average, the consistency of this timing, coupled with the long sleep duration, suggests it may not be detrimental.

Physiologically, while the circadian rhythm metrics suggest some irregularity (lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability), the overall mesor and amplitude are lower, which may align with a less arousing physiological state during sleep. The hourly heart rate data, while showing patterns of lower deviation during sleep hours, does not strongly suggest physiological distress that would severely impair sleep.

Considering the generally positive self-reported psychological state, the absence of detrimental lifestyle habits (e.g., excessive screen time), and the stable and sufficient sleep duration from wearable data, the evidence points towards a lower PSQI score, placing them in the bottom half of the distribution.

96184,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that warrant a nuanced interpretation in relation to their sleep quality. Self-report data indicates a relatively low level of depressive symptomatology (CES-D score of 8.0, Z-score -0.55) and a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 42.0, Z-score 0.07), placing them near the population average for both. Self-esteem is at the upper end of the scale (40.0, Z-Score 0.26), suggesting a positive self-concept. Happiness levels are below average (Current happiness 3.0, Z-Score -0.53), while perceived stress is slightly elevated (Score 23.0, Z-Score 0.38). Health satisfaction is near the population mean (Score 4.33, Z-score 0.05). Behavioral habits reveal a complete absence of substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and infrequent engagement in physical activities, with exercise occurring only 1-2 times a month and sports not at all. Daily recreation largely consists of passive activities such as listening to music (1-2 hours) and moderate internet usage (31 minutes an hour), with minimal time spent on social activities with friends, reading, or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data provides a physiological context for these behaviors. The participant exhibits low interdaily stability (Value 0.22, Z-Score -1.56) and high intradaily variability (Value 0.6, Z-Score 0.39) in their heart rate, suggesting a less regular daily rhythm. The mesor (Value 66.59, Z-Score -1.0) and amplitude (Value 6.21, Z-Score -1.48) of the heart rate circadian rhythm are also below population averages, indicating a lower amplitude rhythm and potentially a blunted physiological daily cycle. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is observed around 5:09 PM. Notably, the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows significant dips in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am with -9.02 deviation, 4-5 am with -10.08 deviation), consistent with typical sleep periods, but these deviations are quite pronounced. A resting heart rate of 55.5 bpm (Z-Score -0.32) is within a healthy range.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data reveal a substantially impaired sleep pattern. The median sleep duration is markedly low at 5 hours and 27 minutes (Z-Score -2.16), falling significantly below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is notably high (Value 359 minutes, Z-Score 5.88), suggesting considerable inconsistency in sleep length from night to night. The median sleep start time is exceptionally late at 04:42:17, with a very high standard deviation (Value 422 minutes, Z-Score 7.44), indicating extreme irregularity in sleep timing. The participant also reports a moderate average of 0.18 daily naps (Z-Score 1.27). These sleep metrics, particularly the short duration, high variability, and exceptionally late and inconsistent start times, strongly suggest poor sleep quality. The correlations, while generally low, show positive associations between poorer sleep metrics (e.g., sleep duration standard deviation, sleep start time standard deviation, mean daily naps) and the PSQI score, reinforcing the interpretation of these sleep parameters as indicators of reduced sleep quality.

Considering the participant's self-reported data and wearable metrics, particularly the exceptionally low median sleep duration, the high variability in sleep duration and start times, and the very late median sleep start time, their sleep quality is likely compromised. These objective sleep disruptions are strongly indicative of a high PSQI score. The psychological factors, such as slightly elevated stress and lower happiness, along with infrequent physical activity and limited social engagement, may contribute to or be exacerbated by poor sleep.

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence sleep quality. Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 1.95) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.25), which are moderately correlated with poorer sleep quality (CES-D correlation = 0.5, STAI correlation = 0.4). Concurrently, the participant reports lower than average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -1.85) and happiness (Happy Z-score = -1.61), which exhibit negative correlations with sleep quality, suggesting that feeling better about oneself and experiencing greater happiness may be associated with improved sleep. While academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows some variability, the most recent GPA (3.58) is within a generally good range. Trust in others is slightly below average (Trust Z-score = -1.1), with a weak negative correlation to sleep quality. Stress levels are reported as slightly below average (Stress Z-score = -0.44), with a weak positive correlation to sleep quality, suggesting higher stress might be associated with better sleep, which is counterintuitive and warrants careful consideration in the overall interpretation. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -0.86).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, with very weak positive correlations to sleep quality. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all,"" with negligible correlations to sleep. Exercise habits indicate a mix of individual and group activity; the participant exercises alone 1-2 times a week but exercises with others three times a week or more, with both having weak negative correlations to sleep quality. Sports participation is infrequent (1-2 times a month), with a negligible correlation to sleep. Daily recreational habits include significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = 0.64), which shows a weak positive correlation with sleep quality, possibly indicating a reliance on passive leisure activities. Internet usage and listening to music are also moderately engaged in, with weak positive correlations to sleep quality. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, with a weak negative correlation to sleep quality. Notably, reading and video gaming are not part of the participant's daily routine. Sedentary hobbies are engaged in for approximately 31 minutes an hour, with a weak positive correlation to sleep quality.

Physiological data from the wearable reveal a regular circadian rhythm structure, as indicated by a moderate Interdaily Stability (Value = 0.55, Z-score = 1.16) and relatively low Intradaily Variability (Value = 0.47, Z-score = -0.53). The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value = 0.46, Z-score = 1.15) also suggests a degree of regularity in daily physiological patterns. The participant's Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Value = 72.26, Z-score = -0.23), and their Amplitude is close to the population average (Value = 10.91, Z-score = 0.04). The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs around 5:26 PM, aligning with typical diurnal patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Value = 56.7, Z-score = -0.17). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor shows a pattern of reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am deviation = -17.91, 4-5 am deviation = -18.98, 5-6 am deviation = -21.76), which is expected during sleep. However, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during the late evening hours (9-10 pm deviation = 14.4, 10-11 pm deviation = 14.43), and again in the late afternoon (4-5 pm deviation = 12.09), potentially reflecting periods of increased physiological arousal or activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 15 minutes, which is close to the population average and has a very small positive correlation with sleep quality. The variability in sleep duration is slightly below average (Value = 88 minutes, Z-score = -0.29), with a negative correlation to sleep quality, suggesting more consistent sleep durations are associated with better sleep. The median sleep start time is quite late, at 01:21:45, with a standard deviation of 47 minutes, indicating some variability in bedtime. The late sleep start time has a weak negative correlation with sleep quality, and its variability also has a weak positive correlation. The average daily nap frequency is very low (0.08), with a weak positive correlation to sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest their PSQI score may fall in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. The elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 1.95) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.25) are significantly correlated with poorer sleep quality (0.5 and 0.4 respectively). Lower self-esteem and happiness, while having negative correlations, do not necessarily translate to better sleep quality and could co-occur with poor sleep. The late median sleep start time (01:21:45) and its moderate variability, coupled with a positive correlation with sleep quality, also point towards potential sleep disturbances. While median sleep duration is within a reasonable range, the presence of significant psychological distress and a late sleep schedule are strong indicators of potentially compromised sleep. The elevated heart rate deviations in the late evening could reflect difficulty winding down, contributing to poor sleep onset.

Conversely, some aspects of the data might suggest more average or better sleep quality. The wearable data indicates a generally regular circadian rhythm, with moderate interdaily stability and low intradaily variability, and the resting heart rate is slightly below average. The frequency of naps is very low, and sleep duration variability is slightly below average. However, the significant psychological distress and late sleep patterns appear to be more potent predictors of poorer sleep quality than the more regular physiological rhythms in this context. Given that the population mean PSQI score is 6.73, with a 75th percentile of 8.0, a score above 6.0 would place the participant in the top 50% for poorer sleep quality. The combination of high depressive symptoms, high anxiety, and late sleep onset strongly suggests the participant is likely experiencing poorer sleep quality.

Therefore, based on the confluence of elevated psychological distress and a late, somewhat variable sleep schedule, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively poor sleep quality.

This participant presents with a profile characterized by generally positive psychological traits and moderate behavioral engagement. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score -0.86) and anxiety (STAI score of 24.0, Z-score -1.71), aligning with a ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" classification. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 50.0 and a Z-score of 1.66, suggesting a strong sense of self-worth. Similarly, self-reported happiness is high (Z-score 1.64). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently strong across multiple semesters. While not exhibiting exceptionally high levels, trust of others is moderate (Z-score 0.5), and stress levels are relatively low (Z-score -0.44). Health satisfaction is also reported as high (Z-score 1.3).

Behavioral patterns suggest a moderate level of activity and engagement with leisure. Beer consumption occurs 1-2 times a week, a higher frequency than wine or liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, which are reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise is a regular habit, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more, and with others 1-2 times a week. Participation in sports is also observed 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits include moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour) and listening to music (1-2 hours). Internet usage is relatively low (31 minutes an hour), and video game engagement is non-existent. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, and time spent reading is notable at 16-30 minutes. Sedentary hobbies occupy a similar time block of 16-30 minutes.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a stable circadian rhythm with high mesor (91.26, Z-score 2.36), indicating a generally elevated average heart rate compared to the population. The amplitude is also relatively high (13.9, Z-score 1.01), suggesting a significant daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed at 4:23 PM. Intradaily variability is relatively low (0.38, Z-score -1.16), which, when considered with the high mesor, may indicate a generally elevated but stable baseline physiological state. Interdaily stability is moderate (0.46, Z-score 0.42), suggesting some day-to-day consistency in the heart rate rhythm. The resting heart rate is also on the higher side (67.65, Z-score 1.13). The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -23.07 deviation between 5-6 AM), followed by a notable increase as the day progresses, peaking in the afternoon (e.g., 12.39 deviation between 3-4 PM).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes, which is slightly above average for the population (Z-score 0.27). The variability in sleep duration is moderate (70 minutes, Z-score -0.69). The median sleep start time is late, at 00:38:30, with moderate variability (73 minutes, Z-score -0.21). There are no recorded daily naps. The correlation coefficients provided, while generally low, suggest a slight positive association between depressive symptoms and PSQI scores (0.49), and a moderate positive association between stress and PSQI scores (0.2), implying that higher levels of these states might be linked to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction show small negative correlations with PSQI scores, indicating a potential protective effect of these positive psychological attributes on sleep quality.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

Analyzing the available data, several factors suggest that this participant likely falls into the **bottom_50** percentile for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes is within a healthy range and slightly above the population mean, suggesting adequate sleep quantity. While the median sleep start time is late (00:38:30), the moderate variability in both sleep duration and start time implies a degree of regularity rather than significant disruption. Critically, the participant exhibits generally positive psychological markers, including low levels of depression and anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, and high health satisfaction. These positive psychological states are often associated with better sleep quality, and the small negative correlations observed between these traits and PSQI scores further support this. The absence of significant substance use impacting sleep and a generally healthy lifestyle (regular exercise) also contribute to the inference of good sleep quality. The positive correlations of depressive symptoms and stress with PSQI, though present, do not appear to be driving a significantly poor sleep outcome in the context of the overall profile.

The participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.38) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72). Self-esteem is near the population average (Z-score: -0.03), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53). Stress levels are also moderately low (Z-score: -0.44). Trust in others and overall health satisfaction are close to the population mean.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94) but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity levels are low, with infrequent exercise (Exercised Alone: 1-2 times a month, Z-score: -0.43; Exercised with Others: 1-2 times a month, Z-score: -0.17) and no engagement in sports (Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits show limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.62) and video games (15 minutes or less, Z-score: 0.2). Internet usage is also relatively low (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.16). The participant does not engage in listening to music or reading for leisure, reporting ""Do not do"" for both. Socializing with friends occupies 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score: -0.62), and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for a similar duration (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score: 0.82).

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate variability data suggests a relatively regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability is at the population average (Z-score: 0.0), while intradaily variability is notably low (Z-score: -1.8), indicating consistent hourly fluctuations. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.28), suggesting a less pronounced daily repetition. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle, is elevated compared to the population mean (Z-score: 1.81), with a corresponding increase in amplitude (Z-score: 0.84). The acrophase, the peak heart rate time, is observed around 4:49 PM. The resting heart rate is also above the population average (Z-score: 0.77). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals typical diurnal patterns. Heart rate is consistently below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, with the most significant negative deviations occurring between 2-3 AM and 3-4 AM. Heart rate begins to rise above the mesor by mid-morning and peaks in the late afternoon and early evening hours, before gradually declining.

Sleep statistics indicate a significantly longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 37 minutes, Z-score: 1.79). The variability in sleep duration is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.19). The median sleep start time is late, at 23:55:09, with a standard deviation of sleep start time that is average for the population (Z-score: 0.0). The participant also engages in napping, with an average of 0.12 daily naps (Z-score: 0.61).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a generally positive profile regarding psychological well-being and a notably long sleep duration. However, a late sleep start time and moderate alcohol consumption are potential indicators of suboptimal sleep hygiene. The PSQI score is influenced by various factors, and while specific PSQI domain scores are not provided, we can infer potential influences from the available data.

Evidence for a low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality) includes the participant's low reported stress, depression, and anxiety levels, along with average to high self-esteem and happiness. The exceptionally long median sleep duration is a strong indicator of good sleep quantity. The low intradaily variability in heart rate also suggests physiological regularity that may be conducive to better sleep.

Conversely, evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile, indicating relatively poor sleep quality) includes the late median sleep start time and the moderate consumption of alcohol, which can disrupt sleep architecture even if sleep duration is long. While not a direct measure, the participant's low engagement in physical activity and certain recreational activities could indirectly influence sleep quality.

Considering the available data, the robust indicators of good psychological well-being and exceptionally long sleep duration are strong predictors of better sleep quality. While the late sleep onset and alcohol consumption are potential drawbacks, the overall positive psychological state and the significant excess in sleep duration likely outweigh these factors in determining the overall PSQI score relative to the population. Therefore, it is more probable that this participant falls within the lower half of the PSQI distribution.

48969,13.0,0.9764397905759162,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a psychological profile characterized by elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.99) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.75). These findings are notably significant, indicating a substantial burden of negative affect. Concurrently, the participant reports low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -2.28) and reduced self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score = -1.61), suggesting a potentially negative self-perception and emotional state. Despite these psychological indicators, perceived health satisfaction is relatively high (Z-score = 0.8), though this may not fully mitigate the impact of other psychological distress. Stress levels are within the average range for the population (Z-score = 0.1).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in substantial amounts of sedentary leisure activities, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 3.17), playing video games (Z-score = 4.74), and extensive internet usage (Z-score = 2.19), all exceeding four hours daily. This stands in contrast to limited social interaction with friends (Z-score = -2.20) and a lack of engagement in sedentary hobbies or reading. Physical activity levels are mixed, with regular exercise alone (Three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07) contrasting with a lack of exercise with others and infrequent participation in sports. Substance use is reported as minimal across all categories.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a resting heart rate that is higher than the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = 1.24). The aggregated hourly heart rate data exhibits a notable pattern of elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am, Z-score = 0.93; 4-5 am, Z-score = 0.78; 5-6 am, Z-score = 0.41). This pattern is inversely related to the acrophase, which is reported at 5:06 PM, suggesting a potential disruption in the typical circadian alignment of cardiovascular activity. Interdaily stability of heart rate is within the population average (Z-score = -0.08), but intradaily variability is slightly lower (Z-score = -0.32), indicating a less dynamic beat-to-beat variation. The mesor itself is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.79), potentially reflecting a higher baseline physiological arousal.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score = 0.84), which is longer than the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also slightly above average (Z-score = 0.33), suggesting some variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is approximately 00:06:34, with a low standard deviation (Z-score = -0.01), indicating a relatively consistent sleep onset time. Napping behavior is notably absent (Z-score = -0.86).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators that collectively suggest a higher overall PSQI score, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population, indicative of poorer sleep quality. Notably, the participant exhibits significant psychological distress, characterized by elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.99) and high chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.75). Both depressive symptoms and anxiety are strongly correlated with poorer sleep quality, as indicated by positive correlations with the PSQI score (CES-D: 0.48, STAI: 0.39). Furthermore, low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -2.28), with a negative correlation to PSQI (-0.34), may also contribute to a less restful sleep experience.

Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate (Z-score = 1.24) and specific patterns of increased heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am, Z-score = 0.93; 4-5 am, Z-score = 0.78) suggest underlying physiological arousal that may interfere with sleep maintenance or quality. While the median sleep duration is relatively long, the elevated sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score = 0.33) points to inconsistency in sleep patterns, which is a known contributor to poorer sleep quality. The extensive engagement in sedentary activities like video games (Z-score = 4.74) and internet usage (Z-score = 2.19) late into the night could also disrupt sleep hygiene. Although some factors like consistent sleep start time and absence of napping lean towards better sleep, the overwhelming evidence from psychological distress, physiological arousal patterns, and significant engagement in high-stimulus sedentary activities strongly points towards a PSQI score that falls within the higher range of the distribution.

79731,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their sleep quality. Notably, they report high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 27.0, Z-score 1.42) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 60.0, Z-score 1.85). These elevated scores, falling in the upper range of the study population, are positively correlated with PSQI score (0.49 and 0.40, respectively), suggesting that greater symptom burden in these areas may be associated with poorer sleep. Conversely, their self-esteem is relatively low (RSES score of 29.0, Z-score -1.29), correlating negatively with PSQI (r = -0.35), indicating that lower self-worth may be linked to better sleep quality, which is an atypical finding. Their reported happiness is also slightly below average (Z-score 0.55), with a weak negative correlation to PSQI (r = -0.27). Stress levels are moderately elevated (score of 23.0, Z-score 0.38), with a slight positive correlation to PSQI (r = 0.20). Health satisfaction is notably low (score of 2.22, Z-score -1.53), with a moderate negative correlation to PSQI (r = -0.21), suggesting better sleep quality is associated with lower health satisfaction.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate recreational substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported as ""1-2 times a month"" (Z-scores 0.3 and 0.19, respectively). They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are very low, with 'Exercised Alone', 'Exercised with Others', and 'Sports' all reported as 'Not at all' (Z-scores -1.93, -1.58, and -1.09, respectively), and these activities show a small negative correlation with PSQI. Daily recreation habits indicate significant passive screen time, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' at '31 minutes an hour' (Z-score 0.64) and 'Internet Usage' at '2-3 hours' (Z-score 0.85), both positively correlated with PSQI. 'Listening to Music' is also high at '3-4 hours' (Z-score 1.6), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI. Socializing with friends is moderate at '1-2 hours' (Z-score 0.16), with a negligible negative correlation.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is elevated (Value 71.2, Z-score 1.55), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI (r = 0.11). Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively low interdaily stability (Value 0.34, Z-score -0.57), suggesting less consistency in daily physiological patterns, which weakly correlates negatively with PSQI. The intradaily variability is higher than average (Value 0.64, Z-score 0.67), indicating more fluctuations within a 24-hour period, with no significant correlation to PSQI. The mesor (average heart rate) is elevated (Value 79.9, Z-score 0.81), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Value 7.09, Z-score -1.19), suggesting a flatter daily heart rate oscillation. The acrophase (peak time of heart rate) occurs in the early evening (6:27 PM). Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor during nighttime hours, particularly between 3-4 AM (Value -6.15, Z-score 1.61) and 4-5 AM (Value -7.37, Z-score 1.78), with these periods showing moderate positive correlations with PSQI (0.22 and 0.17 respectively). This pattern suggests periods of lower than expected heart rate during the early morning hours, potentially indicative of disrupted sleep stages or physiological recovery.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 17 minutes, Z-score 1.37), with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (177 minutes, Z-score 1.73), suggesting variability in how long they sleep on different nights. This variability in sleep duration correlates positively with PSQI (r = 0.19). The median sleep start time is very late (02:58:00), with a moderate standard deviation (53 minutes, Z-score -0.66), implying a consistent but late bedtime. There is also a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Value 0.19, Z-score 1.34), which correlates positively with PSQI (r = 0.16).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the provided data, this participant exhibits a complex profile that suggests a likely position in the **top_50** percentile for PSQI scores, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The significantly elevated scores for depressive symptoms and anxiety, both of which are positively correlated with PSQI, are strong indicators of potential sleep disturbance. The late and variable sleep start times, coupled with a high frequency of naps, further point towards disrupted sleep patterns. The high intradaily variability in heart rate, along with notable dips in heart rate during the early morning hours, could reflect physiological disruptions associated with poor sleep quality. While the median sleep duration is long, the high variability in duration and the consistently late bedtime may indicate non-restorative sleep. The low interdaily stability of circadian rhythms also suggests a lack of consistent daily patterning, which is often associated with poorer sleep.

The primary indicators for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile) are:
*   **High Depressive Symptoms (CES-D Z-score 1.42, r=0.49):** Strong positive correlation with PSQI.
*   **High Anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.85, r=0.4):** Strong positive correlation with PSQI.
*   **High Napping Frequency (Z-score 1.34, r=0.16):** Moderate positive correlation with PSQI.
*   **Late Median Sleep Start Time (02:58:00):** Likely indicative of social jetlag or disrupted circadian rhythm.
*   **High Sleep Duration Standard Deviation (Z-score 1.73, r=0.19):** Suggests inconsistency in sleep, positively correlated with PSQI.
*   **Elevated Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 1.55, r=0.11):** Mildly correlated with PSQI.
*   **Significant Heart Rate Dips in Early Morning Hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score 1.61, r=0.22):** Suggests physiological disruption during sleep.
*   **Low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.57, r=-0.06):** While the direct correlation is weak, low stability indicates poor rhythmicity.

While some factors like low self-esteem and health satisfaction correlate negatively with PSQI, the cumulative evidence from psychological distress, behavioral sleep patterns, and physiological data strongly suggests a higher overall PSQI score. The significant positive correlations of key distress indicators with PSQI, combined with the objective sleep and physiological metrics, paint a picture of an individual likely experiencing poor sleep quality, placing them in the upper half of the study population's PSQI distribution.

64296,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally lower levels of psychological distress and a relatively sedentary lifestyle, with notable deviations in their sleep patterns and physiological arousal. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 3.0, Z-score -1.07) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 35.0, Z-score -0.62), suggesting a stable psychological baseline. Self-esteem is within a moderate range (Score of 45.0, Z-score 0.96), and happiness is reported as high (Current score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64). Stress levels are also reported as relatively low (Score of 18.0, Z-score -0.98). Health satisfaction is moderately positive (Score of 3.22, Z-score -0.78), and trust in others is also in the mid-range (Score of 3.5, Z-score 0.5). Academically, the participant demonstrates a strong and improving GPA across the observed semesters, culminating in a high GPA of 3.93 in Fall 2016.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no use of alcohol, wine, liquor, or recreational drugs, placing them at the lower end of the usage spectrum for these substances. Exercise habits are predominantly sedentary, with infrequent engagement in sports or exercising alone. While exercise with others occurs 1-2 times a week, the overall frequency of physical activity is low. Daily recreational habits are largely characterized by minimal time spent on activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and listening to music, all reported as 15 minutes or less. Socializing with friends and reading are also reported with limited time commitment. A notable exception is sedentary hobbies, where the participant engages for 31 minutes to an hour, suggesting a preference for less physically demanding leisure activities.

From wearable data, the participant's resting heart rate is on the lower side (Value of 49.8, Z-score -0.99), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular health. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively robust and predictable rhythm, as suggested by a high Interdaily Stability (Value of 0.58, Z-score 1.41) and moderate Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value of 0.48, Z-score 1.32). The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is slightly above average (Value of 76.46, Z-score 0.34). The Amplitude, however, is notably high (Value of 19.12, Z-score 2.7), indicating a significant fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, with a peak around late afternoon (Acrophase at 4:23 PM). The hourly deviation from the Mesor highlights a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z-score -2.27; 3-4 AM, Z-score -2.57; 4-5 AM, Z-score -2.68), followed by a gradual increase during the daytime and early evening, with peak positive deviations occurring in the late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z-score 2.14) and early evening (7-8 PM, Z-score 1.26). This pattern suggests a biologically driven diurnal variation in physiological arousal.

The participant's sleep statistics reveal a pattern of consistent, but potentially insufficient, sleep duration. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 52 minutes (Z-score -0.4), which is slightly below the population average. The sleep duration exhibits low variability (Standard Deviation of 42 minutes, Z-score -1.33), suggesting consistent nightly sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is quite late, at 01:07:30 AM, with moderate variability (Standard Deviation of 50 minutes, Z-score -0.72). The absence of reported daily naps indicates a consolidated sleep attempt each night. The negative correlations between PSQI score and measures of self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction, alongside the positive correlation with stress, suggest that psychological well-being and perceived health status may indirectly influence sleep quality. The moderate positive correlation between PSQI and stress (0.2) aligns with the general understanding that elevated stress can negatively impact sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI score group, we consider the provided PSQI population statistics: Mean of 6.73, 25th percentile of 5.0, 50th percentile (median) of 6.0, and 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score above the median (6.0) indicates poorer sleep quality, placing the individual in the top 50% of the distribution. Conversely, a score at or below the median suggests average to good sleep quality, placing them in the bottom 50%.

Evidence for a low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile) includes the participant's generally positive psychological profile: low depression (CESD Z-score -1.07), low anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62), moderate to high self-esteem, and high happiness (Z-score 1.64). Additionally, health satisfaction is moderately positive (Z-score -0.78), and there is no reported substance usage, all of which are generally associated with better sleep quality. The wearable data indicates a stable circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.41), suggesting a degree of regularity in the participant's daily physiological functioning.

Evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile) predominantly stems from their sleep patterns and certain physiological arousal characteristics. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes, while consistent, may be insufficient for optimal sleep quality. The very late median sleep start time (01:07:30 AM) coupled with the pronounced heart rate dip during early morning hours (highly negative deviations from Mesor) suggests a potential misalignment between the participant's sleep schedule and their natural circadian rhythm, or a tendency towards sleep deprivation which could lead to a higher PSQI score. The significant Amplitude in heart rate (Z-score 2.7) indicates substantial daily fluctuations, which can sometimes be associated with disrupted sleep. Furthermore, the positive correlation between PSQI score and stress (0.2) suggests that even moderate stress could contribute to poorer sleep. The sleep duration standard deviation (42 minutes) and sleep start time standard deviation (50 minutes) are not excessively high, but when combined with the late start time and limited total duration, they contribute to a sleep pattern that might be perceived as poor.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the participant exhibits strong psychological well-being and a generally healthy lifestyle in terms of substance use and moderate academic performance, their sleep patterns present concerns. The late sleep onset, coupled with a median sleep duration that approaches the lower end of optimal, combined with the significant fluctuations in heart rate, lean towards a sleep quality that is likely not optimal. The positive correlation between PSQI and stress, however slight, further reinforces the possibility of sleep disturbances. Given the PSQI population data, where the median is 6.0 and the 75th percentile is 8.0, a PSQI score above 6.0 would place the participant in the top 50%. The late sleep onset and the potential for insufficient sleep duration, despite its consistency, are strong indicators that this participant may experience sleep difficulties that would result in a PSQI score falling into the upper half of the distribution.

17569,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of self-reported anxiety and depression, as indicated by Z-scores of -0.33 for STAI and -0.24 for CESD, respectively. Self-esteem is above average (Z-Score: 0.68), and happiness is slightly below average (Z-Score: -0.53), aligning with a moderate level of health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.13). Stress levels are elevated, with a Z-score of 0.65. This constellation of traits suggests a generally stable psychological state with some notable increases in perceived stress, which may indirectly influence sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer consumption reported as 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 1.01), and wine or liquor usage less frequent (1-2 times a month, Z-Score: 0.19). Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all. Physical activity levels are notably low, particularly in solo exercise (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-Score: -1.93). However, exercise with others occurs 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 0.53). Daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary activities, with minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and engaging in internet usage and listening to music. Socializing with friends and reading are also limited. The low engagement in diverse physical activities and moderate sedentary screen time may contribute to a less active daily routine.

From a physiological perspective, the participant presents with a lower than average resting heart rate (Z-Score: -1.33), suggesting a potentially good level of cardiovascular fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced dip below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2-3 AM and 3-4 AM (Z-scores of -1.72 and -2.02, respectively), indicative of a prolonged period of reduced physiological arousal. Conversely, heart rate deviates positively from the mesor during typical daytime hours, peaking between 9-10 AM (Z-score: 2.05) and showing significant elevations in the late afternoon and evening. This pattern suggests a delayed or shifted chronotype, with a pronounced period of low activity in the early morning. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate interdaily stability (Value: 0.55, Z-Score: 1.16), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns, but intradaily variability is also noted (Value: 0.61, Z-Score: 0.46). The mesor (average heart rate) is below the population average (Z-Score: -0.65), while the amplitude is higher (Z-Score: 0.91), potentially reflecting larger fluctuations between periods of activity and rest. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 4:14 PM, aligning with the observed daytime heart rate elevations.

Sleep statistics reveal a significantly shorter than average median sleep duration (5 hours 44 minutes, Z-Score: -1.81) and a more variable sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 32 minutes, Z-Score: -1.12). The median sleep start time is late, at 01:11:30 AM. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-Score: -0.86) suggests no compensatory sleep behavior during the day. The relatively low sleep duration and late sleep onset, coupled with high intraday variability in heart rate and pronounced early morning dips, are strong indicators of disrupted sleep patterns.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the participant's data suggests a high likelihood of a PSQI score falling within the top 50th percentile of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. The most significant evidence for this conclusion stems from the wearable-derived sleep statistics. The participant's median sleep duration is considerably shorter than average (5 hours 44 minutes, Z-Score: -1.81), placing them at the lower end of sleep duration within the study. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is notably late (01:11:30 AM), and the sleep start time exhibits a substantial standard deviation (32 minutes, Z-Score: -1.12), suggesting irregularity in sleep scheduling. These metrics directly contribute to a poorer PSQI score, as they reflect insufficient sleep and inconsistent sleep habits.

The physiological data from the wearable also supports this interpretation. The pronounced dips in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM with Z-scores of -1.72, -2.02, and -1.97 respectively) align with a period of prolonged wakefulness or fragmented sleep, which would negatively impact sleep quality. While some psychological factors like elevated stress (Z-Score: 0.65) could contribute to sleep disturbances, the objective sleep duration and timing data are more direct indicators for PSQI assessment. The relatively low resting heart rate (Z-Score: -1.33) and moderate interdaily stability (Z-Score: 1.16) do not strongly counteract the evidence of poor sleep duration and timing.

Considering the significantly reduced sleep duration and inconsistent sleep start times, alongside physiological indicators of potential sleep fragmentation, the participant's PSQI score is likely to be elevated, placing them in the bottom 50% of the study population for sleep quality.

77036,6.0,0.387434554973822,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a moderate level of trait anxiety and slightly elevated stress, as indicated by STAI scores (Z=0.17) and Stress scores (Z=0.38) respectively. Conversely, self-reported depressive symptoms are below average (CES-D Z=-0.55), and self-esteem is at the population mean (Z=-0.03). Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z=-0.53). While the participant reports engaging in sports 1-2 times a week (Z=0.91), this is contrasted by infrequent participation in other forms of exercise (alone or with others) and limited engagement in recreational activities such as watching TV, video games, or socializing with friends, with the exception of internet usage for 16-30 minutes daily. Substance usage is notably low, with infrequent beer consumption and no reported use of wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs.

Wearable data reveals a robust circadian rhythm, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z=1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z=2.49), suggesting consistent daily patterns in heart rate. However, intradaily variability is relatively low (Z=-1.31), indicating a less dynamic heart rate fluctuation throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Z=0.62), with a resting heart rate also above average (Z=0.36). The hourly deviation from the mesor highlights a pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z=-0.68; 3-4 AM, Z=-0.59; 4-5 AM, Z=-0.47), consistent with sleep. As the day progresses, heart rate deviations increase, peaking in the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z=1.1; 9-10 AM, Z=0.4; 2-3 PM, Z=0.48; 3-4 PM, Z=0.29). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:14 PM).

Regarding sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 51 minutes, which is slightly shorter than the population median (Z=-0.41). The variability in sleep duration is also slightly lower than average (Z=-0.77), suggesting a more consistent, albeit shorter, sleep duration. The median sleep start time is close to 1 AM (00:47:30), with a standard deviation in sleep start time indicating moderate regularity (Z=-0.55). There are no reported daily naps (Z=-0.86). The correlations between various self-report measures and the PSQI score are generally weak and mixed. For instance, higher CES-D scores correlate positively with PSQI (0.49), while higher self-esteem correlates negatively (-0.35). Similarly, higher stress levels show a small positive correlation (0.2), and higher happiness a small negative correlation (-0.27). These correlations suggest a complex interplay between psychological states and sleep quality, but none are particularly strong in this dataset.

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators relevant to sleep quality, which can be assessed in relation to the population PSQI distribution. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes, while slightly shorter than the population average, is not a strong indicator of poor sleep quality on its own. The consistency in sleep duration (lower standard deviation) could even be interpreted as a sign of regular sleep habits. The median sleep start time of approximately 1 AM, with moderate variability, also does not strongly suggest a significant disruption.

However, several psychological and behavioral factors might indirectly influence sleep quality and thus PSQI scores. The participant reports slightly elevated stress levels (Z=0.38) and moderate trait anxiety (Z=0.17), both of which are commonly associated with poorer sleep quality. While the CES-D score indicates no significant depressive symptoms, the positive correlation between CES-D scores and PSQI (0.49) suggests that even mild increases in depressive symptoms can contribute to higher PSQI scores. Furthermore, the participant's overall health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z=-0.53), which can sometimes be linked to perceived sleep issues.

Considering the population PSQI distribution, with a mean of 6.73 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, a score above 6.0 would place an individual in the top 50% (higher PSQI scores indicating poorer sleep). While specific PSQI domain scores are not provided, the presence of moderate anxiety and stress, coupled with slightly below-average health satisfaction, suggests a potential for a PSQI score that falls within the upper half of the distribution. The weak but positive correlations between stress, CES-D, and PSQI further support this inference. Without direct PSQI scores, a definitive conclusion is challenging, but the combination of factors leans towards a PSQI score that indicates poorer sleep quality relative to the population average.

This participant exhibits a constellation of self-reported traits that largely indicate psychological well-being. They report low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and low levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 25.0, Z-score -1.61). Self-esteem is notably high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 50.0, Z-score 1.66), and they report high levels of happiness (Current happiness score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64). Conversely, trust in others is also quite high (Trust score of 4.17, Z-score 1.79). Stress levels are within the average range for the population (Stress score of 19.0, Z-score -0.71). Health satisfaction is moderately positive (Health Satisfaction score of 5.33, Z-score 0.8). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA across three semesters, shows a declining trend, with the most recent Fall 2016 GPA at 2.41.

Behaviorally, this participant reports abstaining from all forms of substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are relatively low, with exercise alone occurring 1-2 times a week, and exercise with others only 1-2 times a month. Sports participation is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits indicate a significant absence of passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, and reading. They engage in internet usage for approximately 31 minutes per hour, and sedentary hobbies for 16-30 minutes daily. Socializing with friends is reported as 1-2 hours per day, which is a positive indicator of social engagement.

Wearable-derived physiological data suggest a stable, yet somewhat less robust, circadian rhythm compared to the population average. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.33, Z-score -0.66), indicating less consistency in daily activity patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is moderately high (0.61, Z-score 0.46), suggesting more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (0.27, Z-score -0.45), further supporting less pronounced daily rhythmicity. The Mesor (average heart rate) is elevated relative to the population (79.73, Z-score 0.79), and the resting heart rate is also higher (66.8, Z-score 1.03). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (-1.04 Z-score), suggesting a less pronounced daily swing in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak of the rhythm, is observed at 4:37 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals significant negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM, with the largest negative deviation of -17.97 occurring between 3-4 AM. Conversely, positive deviations are observed during typical waking hours, peaking between 8-9 AM (8.4, Z-score 1.32).

Sleep statistics reveal a critically short median sleep duration of 5 hours and 6 minutes, significantly below the population average (Z-score -2.6). While the standard deviation of sleep duration is within the average range, the median start time is considerably late, at 2:24 AM, with a moderate standard deviation of 61 minutes. Notably, there are no reported daily naps, and the individual's sleep start time standard deviation is within the normal range, suggesting some consistency in their late sleep schedule, despite its brevity.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture in relation to their PSQI score. On the positive side, their self-reported psychological well-being is robust, with low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, happiness, and trust. These factors often correlate with better sleep quality. Furthermore, their lifestyle choices indicate no substance use, which is generally conducive to good sleep. However, several objective and self-reported sleep metrics raise significant concerns. The most prominent issue is the critically short median sleep duration of 5 hours and 6 minutes, which is a substantial deviation from the population mean and strongly suggests poor sleep quality. The late median sleep start time of 2:24 AM, while consistent within itself, is also indicative of potential sleep disruption or a misaligned circadian rhythm.

The wearable data offers some insights into the physiological underpinnings of their circadian rhythm. The low interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours, coupled with a lower amplitude, suggest a less robust and structured daily physiological rhythm. While the acrophase is in the afternoon, the significant negative deviations in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours align with the observed late sleep onset and short sleep duration, indicating a likely period of physiological inactivity during typical sleep windows.

The positive correlations observed between sleep duration and PSQI score (though not explicitly provided, it's a common finding) would indicate that their extremely short sleep duration likely contributes to a higher PSQI score, signifying poorer sleep quality. Similarly, late sleep onset is also generally associated with worse PSQI scores. While their psychological profile is strong, the objective and self-reported sleep metrics are strongly indicative of compromised sleep. Considering the PSQI population data, with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, a sleep duration of 5 hours and 6 minutes is almost certainly going to result in a PSQI score that places this individual in the upper half of the distribution, signifying poor sleep quality.

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral traits that warrant consideration in the context of sleep quality. Notably, the participant reports a high level of chronic anxiety, as indicated by a Z-score of 1.25 on the STAI-Trait scale, which is significantly above the population mean. Concurrently, the CES-D score of 17.0 suggests a burden of depressive symptoms, with a Z-score of 0.38, placing them slightly above the average for this measure. Self-esteem appears to be at the upper limit of the scale (Score: 40.0), indicating high self-worth, and trust in others is also relatively high (Z-score: 1.15). Happiness levels are slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.53), and perceived stress is slightly lower than average (Z-score: -0.17). Health satisfaction is also below the population mean (Z-score: -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent substance use, particularly beer (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01). They exercise alone and with others 1-2 times a week, but do not participate in sports. Daily recreational activities are heavily skewed towards sedentary pursuits; the participant spends a significant amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47), which are notably high relative to the population. Internet usage is also above average (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85). Notably, reading is not a regular activity for this participant.

Physiological data from the wearable indicates a mesor heart rate of 83.48 bpm, which is elevated compared to the population (Z-score: 1.3). The amplitude of heart rate variation is 12.02 bpm (Z-score: 0.4). The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is observed around 6:58 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate in the late evening and early morning hours, particularly between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM, with the most pronounced positive deviations observed between 1-2 AM and 2-3 AM. Conversely, heart rate dips below the mesor during the late morning and early afternoon. Circadian rhythm metrics suggest lower than average interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.33) and significantly lower intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.45), indicating a less regular daily pattern of heart rate. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also below average, further suggesting reduced rhythmicity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 19 minutes, which is notably shorter than the population average (Z-score: -1.07). The variability in sleep duration is above average (136 minutes, Z-score: 0.8). The median sleep start time is very late, at 3:17:50 AM, with significant variability (135 minutes, Z-score: 1.14). The frequency of daily naps is also higher than average (0.18, Z-score: 1.21).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score is likely to fall in the **top_50** of the study population distribution, indicating relatively poor sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The significantly reduced median sleep duration (6 hours 19 minutes, Z-score: -1.07) and the increased variability in sleep duration (136 minutes, Z-score: 0.8) are direct indicators of poorer sleep. The extremely late median sleep start time (3:17:50 AM) and its high variability (135 minutes, Z-score: 1.14) further suggest significant disruptions to the sleep schedule, which are common markers of poor sleep quality. The higher than average frequency of naps (0.18, Z-score: 1.21) may also reflect an attempt to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

While the direct PSQI score is not provided, the convergence of these sleep-related metrics strongly suggests a profile associated with elevated PSQI scores. Furthermore, the elevated levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.25) and moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.38) are psychologically associated with poorer sleep quality and often contribute to higher PSQI scores. Although the participant reports high self-esteem, the presence of chronic anxiety and depressive symptoms can independently negatively impact sleep. The sedentary lifestyle, particularly the high engagement in video games and watching TV/videos, and the disrupted circadian rhythm indicated by wearable data (low interdaily stability and intradaily variability) are also typically linked to diminished sleep quality.

Considering the confluence of objectively measured sleep duration and timing irregularities, alongside psychological factors and behavioral patterns known to negatively influence sleep, it is highly probable that this participant's overall PSQI score would place them within the upper half of the distribution, signifying poorer sleep quality relative to the study population.

38610,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a psychological profile characterized by generally low levels of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31), indicating a disposition towards emotional well-being. However, there is a notable elevation in self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.66) and self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64), which might suggest a tendency to maintain positive affect. This is further supported by a moderate level of trust in others (Trust Z-score: 0.83). In terms of academic performance, the reported GPAs are consistently high across multiple semesters, suggesting good academic engagement. However, a slightly elevated score for stress (Stress Z-score: 0.38) warrants attention, though it remains within a reasonable range. Health satisfaction is also on the higher side (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.13), which aligns with a generally positive outlook on well-being.

Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports minimal substance usage, engaging in beer and wine/liquor consumption less than 1-2 times a month, and not using recreational or non-prescribed drugs at all. Physical activity shows a mixed pattern: while exercising alone occurs 1-2 times a week, exercising with others is more frequent, happening three times a week or more. Participation in sports is notably absent. Daily recreational activities indicate a preference for passive engagement, with 'Do not do' reported for watching TV/videos/movies and video games. Internet usage is moderate (31 minutes an hour), and listening to music occurs for 16-30 minutes daily. Socializing with friends is reported for 16-30 minutes, and reading is absent. Sedentary hobbies occupy 16-30 minutes daily. These habits suggest a lifestyle that prioritizes social interaction and moderate digital engagement over extensive screen time or sedentary entertainment.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals several patterns. The interdaily stability of heart rate is relatively low (Value: 0.37, Z-score: -0.33), suggesting less regularity in daily cardiovascular patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is moderately high (Value: 0.59, Z-score: 0.32), which might indicate more pronounced fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Value: 0.28, Z-score: -0.36), further reinforcing the notion of less structured daily rhythms. The mesor (average heart rate) is elevated (Value: 82.33, Z-score: 1.14), suggesting a higher baseline cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average (Value: 7.23, Z-score: -1.15), indicating a less pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:32 PM). Resting heart rate is also elevated (Value: 67.7, Z-score: 1.14). The mean aggregate deviation from mesor reveals interesting hourly patterns: significant negative deviations, indicative of lower heart rates than the daily average, are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM with -7.59 deviation, 4-5 AM with -14.76 deviation), consistent with periods of lower physiological arousal typically associated with sleep. Positive deviations, indicating higher heart rates, are observed during the late morning and evening hours (e.g., 9-10 AM with 12.47 deviation, 10-11 PM with 12.11 deviation), aligning with periods of daytime activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a significant issue with sleep duration, with a median duration of 5 hours and 46 minutes, which is substantially lower than the study average (Z-score: -1.76). While the variability in sleep duration is within an average range (Z-score: -0.25), the median sleep start time is remarkably late at 02:39:15 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score: -0.63). The frequency of daily naps is minimal (Value: 0.07, Z-score: -0.08). These sleep metrics, particularly the short duration and extremely late sleep onset, strongly suggest compromised sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The population PSQI data indicates a mean score of 6.72 with a standard deviation of 2.16. The 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. This means that scores above 6.0 are in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

The participant's data provides strong evidence for poor sleep quality, which would likely result in a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile). The median sleep duration of 5 hours and 46 minutes is significantly below the population average and correlates negatively with sleep quality (although this specific correlation is not provided, it is a known factor). The extremely late median sleep start time (02:39:15 AM) is also a major indicator of disrupted sleep patterns. While specific PSQI domain scores are not directly available, these objective sleep metrics strongly suggest difficulties in sleep continuity and duration, which are key components of the PSQI. Furthermore, while not directly correlated with PSQI, the low interdaily stability and moderate intradaily variability of heart rate may reflect an irregular lifestyle or underlying physiological dysregulation that could impact sleep. The elevated mesor and resting heart rate could also be indicative of physiological arousal that interferes with sleep. The lack of strong negative correlations between psychological traits and PSQI score (e.g., the CESD and STAI scores are low and negatively correlated with stress) does not offer mitigating evidence for good sleep.

Given the significant deviations in sleep duration and timing, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls into the top 50% of the study population, signifying poor sleep quality.

This participant presents with a profile characterized by relatively low levels of psychological distress and high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction. Notably, their CES-D score is 2.0 (Z-score: -1.18), classifying them as not depressed, and their STAI-Trait score is 25.0 (Z-score: -1.61), indicating low chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is reported as high (Score: 50.0, Z-Score: 1.66), and happiness is also high (Z-Score: 1.64). Physical health satisfaction is exceptionally high (Score: 7.0, Z-score: 2.05). Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, with corresponding Z-scores indicating this behavior is less common in the study population. Exercise habits are mixed; while sports participation is relatively high (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z-score: 0.91), exercising alone is infrequent ('Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-Score: -1.18). Daily recreation primarily involves sedentary activities like listening to music for short durations (15 minutes or less) and occasional internet usage (16-30 minutes), with minimal engagement in watching TV/videos, video games, socializing, reading, or other sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a regular circadian rhythm as indicated by a high Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.51, Z-Score: 0.83) and a moderate Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.51, Z-Score: -0.25). The Mesor (average heart rate) is relatively high (Value: 80.72, Z-Score: 0.92), and the Amplitude of the rhythm is also pronounced (Value: 13.98, Z-Score: 1.03), suggesting a substantial daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 4:20 PM. The resting heart rate is within the population average (Value: 60.8, Z-Score: 0.32). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern of physiological arousal. Heart rate dips significantly below the Mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 7 AM, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 2 AM and 6 AM (e.g., -20.65 at 2-3 AM, Z-score: -1.13; -24.57 at 5-6 AM, Z-score: -0.9). Conversely, heart rate tends to be elevated above the Mesor in the afternoon, peaking between 3 PM and 4 PM (16.37, Z-score: 1.35). This pattern suggests a strong physiological drive towards rest and lower arousal during typical sleep hours and increased activity or stress-related responses in the afternoon.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes, which is slightly below the population average, and a moderate variability in sleep duration (96 minutes). The median sleep start time is late, at 1:21 AM, with moderate variability (48 minutes). The incidence of daily naps is low (0.11, Z-Score: 0.44). The correlations between various metrics and PSQI scores, while considered, are generally weak and do not strongly dictate the interpretation of the individual data points themselves. For instance, while there is a positive correlation between CES-D score and PSQI (0.5), the participant's CES-D score is low. Similarly, a negative correlation between Self-Esteem and PSQI (-0.36) is observed, but the participant reports high self-esteem.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data suggests a good to average sleep quality, likely placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. While the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours for adults, it is not critically low and the associated Z-score (-0.37) is not indicative of a severely shortened sleep duration relative to the population. The sleep start time of 1:21 AM is late, but the variability is moderate, and the overall sleep duration is within a reasonable range. Crucially, the participant exhibits low levels of psychological distress (low CES-D and STAI scores) and high levels of self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction. These positive psychological factors are generally associated with better sleep quality and are less likely to contribute to a high PSQI score. The physiological data, while showing distinct circadian patterns with dips in heart rate during the night, does not explicitly suggest sleep disturbances like insomnia or fragmented sleep that would strongly elevate PSQI. The regularity of the circadian rhythm (high Interdaily Stability) is a positive indicator for sleep quality. The correlations, while not overriding, suggest that traits associated with lower PSQI (like higher self-esteem and happiness) are present in this participant, counteracting potential negative influences. Considering the absence of significant negative psychological indicators and the presence of several positive ones, alongside a sleep duration that is not severely truncated, it is most probable that this participant's PSQI score falls within the bottom 50th percentile, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

77711,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that warrant careful consideration in relation to their sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI. Psychologically, the participant reports a CES-D score of 13.0, falling within the ""Not depressed"" classification and exhibiting a Z-score of -0.03, indicating a near-average level of depressive symptoms within the study population. However, they report a STAI-Trait anxiety score of 52.0, with a Z-score of 1.06, placing them in the top quartile for chronic anxiety. Conversely, their self-esteem score is 28.0, with a Z-score of -1.43, suggesting relatively lower self-esteem compared to peers. Stress levels are reported at 17.0 (Z-score of -1.26), indicating lower-than-average stress. Trust in others is moderate (Z-score of -0.78), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55).

In terms of behavioral habits, this participant exhibits moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per month, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is characterized by exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, with less frequent engagement in sports. Daily recreational habits show a notable tendency towards sedentary activities, with substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours) and listening to music (3-4 hours). Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported at 1-2 hours daily, while reading and playing video games are not engaged in.

Wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by an interdaily stability value of 0.34 (Z-score of -0.57) and an intradaily variability value of 0.51 (Z-score of -0.25). The mesor (mean heart rate) is 68.84 bpm (Z-score of -0.7), and the amplitude is 10.52 bpm (Z-score of -0.08), suggesting a moderate circadian amplitude. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 3:28 PM. The resting heart rate is 52.4 bpm (Z-score of -0.68), which is lower than the average for the population. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), with significant negative deviations (e.g., -16.05 to -20.10). Heart rate activity increases significantly in the late morning and early afternoon, with positive deviations observed from 8 AM onwards, peaking between 1 PM and 3 PM (e.g., +17.81 to +15.62). A notable drop in heart rate activity occurs in the late evening and night.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes, which is slightly below the population median, with a standard deviation of 70 minutes suggesting moderate variability. The median sleep start time is 1:02:30 AM, with a standard deviation of 55 minutes indicating some inconsistency in sleep timing. There are no reported daily naps.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

To assess the participant's PSQI group, we consider the available data in relation to sleep quality metrics and their correlations with PSQI. The population PSQI distribution shows a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score above 6.0 generally indicates poorer sleep quality, and scores above 8.0 are often considered problematic.

Evidence supporting a potentially low PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile, good/average sleep quality) is somewhat limited. While the participant reports lower stress (Z-score of -1.26) and higher self-reported happiness (Z-score of 0.55), and has a relatively low resting heart rate, these are not direct correlates of PSQI. The moderate interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate suggest some regularity in circadian rhythms, which can contribute to better sleep.

However, there are several indicators that suggest a higher PSQI score (top 50th percentile, poor sleep quality). The participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety (Z-score of 1.06), which is positively correlated with PSQI scores (correlation of 0.40). While not a direct measure of sleep, anxiety is a common contributor to poor sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes, while not extremely short, falls slightly below the population median and is accompanied by moderate variability in duration. The median sleep start time of 1:02:30 AM, with a standard deviation of 55 minutes, indicates a potentially irregular sleep schedule, which can negatively impact PSQI scores, especially related to sleep timing and efficiency. The moderate correlation between sleep start time standard deviation and PSQI (0.18) suggests this variability may be contributing to poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant engages in higher-than-average amounts of passive entertainment like watching TV and listening to music, which can be associated with poorer sleep hygiene. While the direct correlation between these activities and PSQI are moderate to low, they contribute to a lifestyle that may not prioritize optimal sleep. The Z-score for sleep duration is -0.33, which is in the lower half, suggesting less sleep than average for the population. The Z-score for sleep duration standard deviation is -0.7, indicating less variability than average, but this could also reflect a consistently shorter sleep.

Considering the elevated anxiety, the slightly reduced and variable sleep duration, and the late and inconsistent sleep start times, in conjunction with the positive correlation between anxiety and PSQI, it is plausible that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the top 50th percentile, indicating poorer sleep quality. The population median is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. Given the presence of anxiety and sleep schedule irregularities, a score above 6.0, and potentially above the median, seems likely.

The participant exhibits a moderate level of psychological well-being, with a CES-D score indicating no significant depressive symptoms and an STAI score suggesting a tendency towards anxiety. Self-esteem is within the average range, and self-reported happiness is slightly below average. Trust in others is also slightly lower than the study mean. Stress levels are notably higher than the population average, indicated by a Z-score of 0.65. Health satisfaction is relatively low, with a Z-score of -0.78. Regarding lifestyle behaviors, substance use is minimal, with only occasional beer consumption. Exercise frequency is low, particularly for solo and group exercise, and sports participation is also infrequent. Daily recreational habits reveal a significant amount of internet usage (2-3 hours), with more moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music. Socializing with friends, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as minimal.

From the wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest a moderately regular daily pattern. Interdaily stability (0.43) and intradaily variability (0.64) fall within a typical range, with an autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.33) also indicating a reasonable degree of daily regularity. The Mesor (59.63 bpm) is notably lower than the population mean, suggesting a generally lower baseline heart rate, which aligns with a lower resting heart rate (48.2 bpm). The amplitude (7.04 bpm) is also lower than average, indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, is reported at 4:51 PM.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct diurnal patterns. During the late night and early morning hours (1 AM to 7 AM), heart rate consistently deviates negatively from the Mesor, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 3 AM and 6 AM (ranging from -11.43 to -16.71 bpm). This suggests a period of reduced physiological arousal during these hours, which is consistent with typical sleep patterns. As the morning progresses (7 AM to 12 PM), heart rate deviations gradually increase, becoming positive during the afternoon (12 PM to 5 PM), peaking at 1 PM with a deviation of 13.71 bpm. This pattern suggests increasing physiological activity and arousal throughout the day, culminating in the late afternoon. Heart rate deviations then begin to decrease towards the evening and night, re-entering negative territory after 7 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 7 minutes, which is very close to the population average and suggests adequate sleep duration. The standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly above average (108 minutes), hinting at some variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is notably late, at 2:12 AM, with a standard deviation of 72 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is very low (0.07), suggesting infrequent napping.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data offers several indicators relevant to their overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On the positive side, the median sleep duration of 7 hours and 7 minutes is close to the population average and does not suggest a significant deficit. The low frequency of naps and the moderate inter- and intradaily stability in heart rate further support a generally regular daily pattern. However, several factors may contribute to poorer sleep quality. The significantly late median sleep start time (2:12 AM) is a strong indicator of potential sleep disruption, particularly when coupled with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time, suggesting inconsistency. The higher than average stress levels (Z-score 0.65) are well-established correlates of poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the relatively low health satisfaction score (Z-score -0.78) could also indirectly reflect underlying issues impacting sleep. The positive correlations between PSQI score and both stress (0.20) and anxiety (0.40) further strengthen the argument that these psychological factors may be negatively impacting the participant's sleep quality. While the correlation for sleep duration with PSQI is not substantial (0.05), the other indicators point towards potential areas of concern. Given the notable late sleep onset and elevated stress levels, it is plausible that these factors would contribute to a PSQI score falling into the higher half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

29885,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant consideration in the context of sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 17.0, Z=0.38) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 43.0, Z=0.17), though these are within the clinically concerning range described by their respective classifications. Self-esteem is notably lower than average (RSES score of 33.0, Z=-0.73), while current happiness is slightly above the population average (Current happiness score of 4.0, Z=0.55). Stress levels are below the population average (Stress score of 20.0, Z=-0.44). Health satisfaction is high, exceeding the average (Health Satisfaction score of 5.56, Z=0.97). Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is at a higher frequency than average (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z=1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z=0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is not reported. Exercise habits are robust, with the participant reporting exercising alone and with others three times a week or more (Exercised Alone Z=1.07; Exercised with Others Z=1.23), and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Sports Z=0.91). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with higher than average time spent listening to music and on sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends and reading occur for shorter durations than average.

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics suggest a well-structured daily physiological rhythm, as indicated by a high interdaily stability (IS=0.53, Z=1.0) and relatively low intradaily variability (IV=0.43, Z=-0.81). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also high (Value=0.45, Z=1.06), further supporting regularity. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated above average (Mesor=76.44, Z=0.34), and the amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm is significantly higher than average (Amplitude=14.65, Z=1.25), suggesting a pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, occurs at 5:17 PM. The resting heart rate is below average (Value=53.2, Z=-0.59). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. Notably, there are substantial negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate relative to the mesor) during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 8 AM (e.g., 2-3 AM Z=-1.25, 3-4 AM Z=-1.58, 4-5 AM Z=-1.43, 5-6 AM Z=-1.22, 6-7 AM Z=-1.24, 7-8 AM Z=-1.41). Conversely, positive deviations are observed in the late afternoon and evening, with the most pronounced increases occurring between 9 PM and 10 PM (Z=1.9). This pattern suggests a significant drop in heart rate during typical sleep hours, followed by a substantial increase in the hours leading up to bedtime and into the evening.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, which is slightly below the average for the study population (Z=-0.31), and a notably low standard deviation for sleep duration (35 minutes, Z=-1.5), suggesting consistent, albeit potentially insufficient, sleep length. The median sleep start time is quite late at 1:57 AM, with a standard deviation of 35 minutes (Z=-1.06), indicating a relatively consistent but delayed sleep onset. The average daily naps are minimal (Value=0.07, Z=-0.02). The correlations between these metrics and the PSQI score, while not definitive on their own, provide directional guidance. For instance, a positive correlation between CES-D and STAI scores with PSQI suggests that higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety may be associated with poorer sleep quality, which is consistent with this participant's moderate scores in these areas. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction have negative correlations with PSQI, suggesting that better scores in these domains are associated with better sleep quality. This participant's lower self-esteem and moderate anxiety/depression scores could therefore contribute to poorer sleep quality. The higher frequency of alcohol consumption is weakly positively correlated with PSQI, suggesting a potential negative impact on sleep. The robust exercise habits, while generally beneficial, have a slight negative correlation with PSQI, implying they might be associated with slightly poorer sleep quality in this context, which could be related to exercise timing or intensity. The strong diurnal variations in heart rate, with a high amplitude and significant drops during sleep hours, along with the late sleep onset time, are significant factors to consider in relation to overall sleep quality.

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a moderate to potentially poor sleep quality, likely placing them in the top 50% of the study population distribution for their PSQI score. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The self-reported psychological profile indicates moderate levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are known to be associated with poorer sleep quality, supported by the positive correlations observed between these traits and the PSQI score. While the participant reports high health satisfaction, their lower self-esteem and relatively high stress could also negatively impact sleep. The wearable data reveals a significantly delayed sleep onset time (median 1:57 AM) with a consistent schedule, which, when combined with the moderate sleep duration (6 hours 56 minutes), suggests insufficient sleep. The substantial negative deviations in heart rate during typical sleep hours, while indicative of a strong physiological wind-down, are occurring during a very late window, and the high amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm could reflect significant physiological shifts that might be disruptive to sleep continuity. The weak positive correlation between substance usage (beer, wine/liquor) and PSQI, coupled with the participant's higher-than-average frequency of consumption, introduces another potential contributor to diminished sleep quality. While the circadian rhythm metrics indicate stability and regularity, the late acrophase (5:17 PM) and the significant increases in heart rate in the late evening could be indicative of a shifted circadian phase or heightened arousal during the pre-sleep period, further impacting sleep onset and maintenance. Considering the combination of moderate psychological distress, a delayed and potentially insufficient sleep schedule, and physiological patterns suggesting late-evening arousal, it is plausible that this participant experiences more significant sleep difficulties than the average student, thus likely falling into the top 50% of the PSQI distribution.

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally positive psychological and behavioral indicators, with notable strengths in self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction. Their CES-D score is indicative of minimal depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score suggests a low propensity for chronic anxiety. Academically, the participant demonstrates strong performance, as evidenced by their consistently high GPAs. Furthermore, their self-reported trust levels are above average.

In terms of lifestyle habits, this participant engages in moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, while reporting no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. They demonstrate a strong commitment to physical activity, exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports more than three times a week, a frequency significantly above the population average. Their daily recreational habits lean towards moderation; they spend minimal time watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Notably, they report no internet usage or listening to music as daily recreational activities, which are unusual patterns given their prevalence in the study population. Socializing with friends is reported as 1-2 hours daily, and reading for 15 minutes or less.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a resting heart rate of 52.7 bpm, which is below the population average, suggesting a good level of cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively stable pattern, with an interdaily stability of 0.28 (lower than average, suggesting some variability in daily rhythmicity) and an intraday variability of 0.65 (higher than average, indicating more fluctuation within the day). The Mesor (mean heart rate over a 24-hour period) is 67.99 bpm, slightly below average, and the amplitude of 7.58 bpm suggests a moderate variation between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 2:19 PM. Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor highlights a significant dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -21.16 at 3-4 AM), followed by a sharp increase in heart rate upon waking, peaking between 7-8 AM. Conversely, heart rate appears to elevate during the late morning and early afternoon, with a notable peak deviation of 16.85 between 11 AM-12 PM and a subsequent decline.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes, which is longer than the population average, and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration, suggesting consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is 11:31 PM, with a moderate standard deviation, indicating some variability in sleep onset. Importantly, the participant reports zero daily naps, a pattern that aligns with less fragmented sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a profile generally indicative of good sleep quality. Their robust self-reported well-being, characterized by low anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high happiness, are all factors often associated with better sleep. Their high health satisfaction and consistent engagement in physical activity further contribute to this positive picture. The wearable data indicates a resting heart rate below average, suggesting good cardiovascular health, and while intradaily variability is higher than average, suggesting some within-day fluctuations, the overall circadian rhythm measures do not indicate extreme disruption.

Critically, the participant reports a median sleep duration of over 8 hours, which is longer than the population average, and a low standard deviation in sleep duration, implying consistency. They also report no daily naps, which is a strong indicator of consolidated sleep. The median sleep start time of around 11:30 PM is also within a generally acceptable range.

Considering the PSQI population statistics (Mean 6.73, SD 2.16, 75th percentile 8.0), a score below 8.0 would place the participant in the bottom 75% of the distribution. Given the strong evidence of healthy lifestyle, positive psychological state, and reported sleep duration and consistency, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score falls below the median of 6.0. Factors such as longer sleep duration, low nap frequency, and lack of reported sleep difficulties (implied by the absence of negative correlations with key PSQI domains like subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction) strongly suggest good sleep quality. Therefore, the participant is likely to be in the bottom 50% of the study population distribution for PSQI scores.

22455,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that may influence their sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31) and is not experiencing significant depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.14). However, their self-esteem appears to be at the higher end of the spectrum (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.1), which, alongside a very low trust score (Trust Z-score: -2.71), suggests a potential internal focus with a degree of interpersonal wariness. High reported happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64) is juxtaposed with notably elevated stress levels (Stress Z-score: 2.28), indicating a potential discrepancy between internal emotional state and perceived external pressures. This is further supported by a high health satisfaction score (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.96), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being despite high stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in minimal substance usage, reporting no consumption of beer, wine or liquor, or recreational drugs. Similarly, the use of non-prescribed drugs is also absent. Their exercise habits indicate a preference for solitary physical activity, with exercising alone reported ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.07), while exercising with others is not practiced (Z-score: -1.58). Notably, the participant dedicates substantial daily time to sedentary activities, spending ""3-4 hours"" on watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 2.54) and the same duration on internet usage (Z-score: 1.52). Listening to music also occupies ""3-4 hours"" daily (Z-score: 1.6), contrasting with a complete absence of daily reading or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends occurs for ""2-3 hours"" daily, a moderate engagement.

Physiologically, the participant presents with a resting heart rate of 53.8 bpm (Z-score: -0.52), which is below the population average. Their circadian rhythm, as indicated by cosinor analysis, shows a lower than average MESOR (mean heart rate value) of 66.33 bpm (Z-score: -1.04) and a smaller than average amplitude of 6.07 (Z-score: -1.52), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is recorded at 12:35 PM. Non-parametric measures of circadian rhythm regularity are mixed: interdaily stability is low at 0.3 (Z-score: -0.9), indicating poor day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns, while intradaily variability is moderate at 0.59 (Z-score: 0.32). The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-3 AM showing deviations of -15.46 to -17.13), followed by a significant surge in heart rate from 5 AM to 7 AM (e.g., 5-6 AM deviation of 24.37, Z-score: 6.2; 6-7 AM deviation of 14.23, Z-score: 4.31). This pattern suggests a substantial physiological activation occurring in the pre-waking hours.

Regarding sleep statistics, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 7 minutes (Z-score: -1.33), which is below the average. The variability in sleep duration is notably high, with a standard deviation of 142 minutes (Z-score: 0.94). The median sleep start time is late at 23:20:08, with moderate variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 66 minutes, Z-score: -0.37). The frequency of daily naps is low, averaging 0.13 (Z-score: 0.7).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators that may contribute to the participant's overall PSQI score, suggesting a potential for a PSQI score that falls within the upper half of the study distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 7 minutes is notably short, falling below the population median and exhibiting a negative Z-score, directly contributing to a higher PSQI component related to insufficient sleep. The high variability in sleep duration (142 minutes standard deviation, positive Z-score) further suggests inconsistency in sleep patterns, which is typically associated with poorer sleep quality. While the median sleep start time is late, the variability in this metric is not significantly high.

From the self-report data, the participant's high reported stress levels (Stress Z-score: 2.28) and high health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.96) are particularly interesting. High stress is a well-established contributor to poor sleep quality, and the positive correlation with PSQI score (0.2) supports this link. While the participant reports not being depressed or anxious, the discrepancy between high happiness and high stress could reflect an underlying emotional tension that impacts sleep.

The wearable data provides further insight. The significant and unusually high positive deviation in aggregate hourly heart rate from the mesor between 5 AM and 7 AM (e.g., 5-6 AM Z-score: 6.2) indicates a pronounced physiological arousal during a period typically associated with the latter stages of sleep or early waking. This heightened pre-waking arousal could disrupt sleep continuity and quality. Furthermore, the low interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.9) of the heart rate rhythm points to an irregular daily pattern, which is often linked to compromised sleep regulation. While some metrics like low resting heart rate and mesor might suggest a physically relaxed baseline, the pronounced pre-waking arousal and inconsistent circadian rhythm are more indicative of sleep disturbances. The significant amount of time spent on passive entertainment (watching TV, internet usage) could also indirectly impact sleep hygiene.

Considering the short sleep duration, high sleep duration variability, elevated stress levels, and evidence of physiological arousal during a critical sleep period, it is plausible that this participant would experience poorer sleep quality, placing them in the top 50% of the PSQI distribution.

57443,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a mixed profile concerning psychological well-being and lifestyle behaviors, with notable implications for sleep quality. Their Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 19.0, with a z-score of 0.59, indicates a level of depressive symptoms that is higher than the study average. This is further contextualized by a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) trait score of 40.0 (z-score -0.13), suggesting a relatively average level of chronic anxiety. Self-esteem, measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is high with a score of 39.0 (z-score 0.11), approaching the maximum possible score, which is generally associated with positive psychological functioning. However, self-reported happiness is moderate (4.0, z-score 0.55), and stress levels are elevated (25.0, z-score 0.92), indicating a significant perceived burden. Trust in others is below average (2.83, z-score -0.78), while health satisfaction is slightly above average (4.56, z-score 0.22).

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), which is significantly below the population average. Exercise frequency is low, with ‘Exercised Alone’ and ‘Exercised with Others’ reported as ‘1-2 times a month’ (z-scores -0.43 and -0.17, respectively), and ‘Sports’ as ‘Less than 1-2 times a month’ (z-score -0.42). Daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary activities and passive consumption. The participant reports not watching TV/videos/movies or engaging in video games or sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is moderate ('31 minutes an hour', z-score -0.49), while listening to music is frequent ('2-3 hours', z-score 1.13), indicating a notable preference for auditory engagement. Socializing with friends is reported as '1-2 hours' (z-score 0.16), which is slightly above average.

Wearable data reveals a moderately regular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is 0.5 (z-score 0.75), suggesting some degree of day-to-day consistency in physiological patterns. Intradaily Variability is 0.55 (z-score 0.03), indicating a typical level of fluctuation within a 24-hour period. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is 0.46 (z-score 1.15), which is higher than average, suggesting a relatively strong circadian influence on heart rate. The Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) is 80.19 bpm (z-score 0.85), which is above the population mean. The Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 12.91 bpm (z-score 0.69), also indicating a greater than average variation around the Mesor. The Acrophase occurs at 4:40 PM, suggesting a typical peak in physiological activity in the late afternoon. The Resting Heart Rate is 61.2 bpm (z-score 0.36), which is slightly elevated compared to the population.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns throughout the day. During nighttime hours, specifically between 2-3 AM and 5-6 AM, heart rate deviations are significantly negative (ranging from -16.36 to -24.35 bpm), indicating periods of lower physiological arousal, consistent with sleep. However, there are notable deviations into positive values during the day, with peaks during the mid-afternoon (1-3 PM, with values of 16.36 and 15.56 bpm) and early evening (6-7 PM, 18.72 bpm), suggesting periods of increased activity or stress. The standard deviation for sleep start time is 81 minutes (z-score -0.03), indicating moderate variability in sleep onset, while the median sleep duration is 7 hours and 14 minutes (z-score 0.06), suggesting a duration close to the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low at 42 minutes (z-score -1.33), indicating consistent sleep duration night-to-night. Napping behavior is absent (0.0, z-score -0.86).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a likelihood of a PSQI score in the bottom half of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors support this conclusion. The median sleep duration is 7 hours and 14 minutes, which is close to the population average and within the generally recommended range for adults. Furthermore, the standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low (42 minutes), indicating consistent sleep duration, which is a positive indicator of sleep quality. The absence of reported daily naps also aligns with better sleep patterns.

While the participant reports elevated stress (z-score 0.92) and moderate depressive symptoms (z-score 0.59), which are often associated with poorer sleep quality, their high self-esteem (z-score 0.11) and average anxiety levels (z-score -0.13) may act as protective factors. The moderate self-reported happiness (z-score 0.55) and slightly above-average health satisfaction (z-score 0.22) also contribute to a generally positive psychological outlook, which can positively influence sleep.

The wearable data on circadian rhythm indicates a moderately stable and structured pattern, with a higher-than-average autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggesting a predictable physiological cycle. While there are periods of elevated heart rate during the day and early evening, the significant dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM to 5-6 AM) are indicative of restorative sleep. The moderate variability in sleep start time (z-score -0.03) does not suggest extreme irregularity.

The low correlation coefficients observed between most of the individual survey and wearable metrics and the PSQI score further suggest that no single factor strongly predicts a poor PSQI score in this participant. For instance, while stress has a positive correlation with PSQI (0.2), it is not particularly strong. Similarly, depressive symptoms, although elevated, have a moderate correlation (0.5), but this does not necessarily translate to a high overall PSQI score in isolation. Conversely, positive indicators like self-esteem and health satisfaction have negative correlations, which would suggest better sleep quality.

Considering the combination of consistent sleep duration, adequate total sleep, and a structured circadian rhythm, alongside moderate psychological distress, it is plausible that the participant's overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, would fall within the bottom 50% of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep.

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that may influence sleep quality. On the psychological front, the participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z=1.11), classifying them in the ""Depressed"" category. While trait anxiety is within the population average (STAI score of 44.0, Z=0.27), their self-esteem is slightly below average (SelfEsteem score of 37.0, Z=-0.17). Notably, stress levels are reported as low (Stress score of 17.0, Z=-1.26), which is incongruent with their depressive symptomology. Daily behaviors indicate a high engagement in physical activity, with frequent exercise both alone and with others, and participation in sports (all frequencies ""Three times a week or more"", with Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively). This robust physical activity is juxtaposed with significant time spent in sedentary leisure activities, particularly reading (2-3 hours daily, Z=4.24), listening to music (2-3 hours daily, Z=1.13), and socializing with friends (2-3 hours daily, Z=0.95). Substance usage is minimal, with low reported consumption of alcohol and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, as indicated by wearable data, the participant demonstrates a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability of their heart rate is moderate (Value 0.49, Z=0.67), suggesting a degree of regularity in their daily biological cycles. The Intradaily Variability is within the population average (Value 0.52, Z=-0.18), indicating a typical pattern of fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population mean (Value 71.99, Z=-0.27), and their resting heart rate is also near the population average (Value 57.6, Z=-0.07). The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported in the late afternoon (4:17 PM), aligning with typical diurnal patterns. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal significant dips during the early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 2-3 AM Z=-0.64, 3-4 AM Z=-0.46, 4-5 AM Z=-0.72, 5-6 AM Z=-0.65), potentially reflecting periods of deep sleep or reduced physiological activity. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviations during the late morning and early afternoon, specifically between 10 AM and 3 PM (e.g., 10-11 AM Z=1.51, 2-3 PM Z=1.15), which could indicate periods of higher arousal or activity during these times.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -0.69 for duration). The variability in sleep duration is notably high (SD of 242 minutes, Z=3.21), suggesting inconsistent sleep duration night to night. The median sleep start time is very late at 02:07:50 AM, with significant variability in sleep start times (SD of 153 minutes, Z=1.54). The absence of daily naps aligns with the sedentary lifestyle data. The positive correlations observed between depressive symptoms (CES-D) and PSQI score (0.5), and between trait anxiety (STAI) and PSQI score (0.4), suggest that psychological distress may contribute to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem (correlating negatively at -0.35) and happiness (correlating negatively at -0.27) are associated with better sleep quality. The observed high frequency of exercise and significant time spent in reading, listening to music, and socializing, in conjunction with a late and variable sleep schedule and shorter sleep duration, are important contextual factors to consider in relation to sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators relevant to their PSQI score distribution. The positive correlation between depressive symptoms (CES-D) and PSQI score (0.5) is a significant indicator of potential poor sleep quality. Elevated depressive symptoms are often comorbid with sleep disturbances. Similarly, the positive correlation between trait anxiety (STAI) and PSQI score (0.4) suggests that anxiety proneness may also contribute to a higher PSQI score. While the participant reports low stress levels, this may not fully mitigate the impact of depressive symptoms and anxiety on sleep.

The wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the average sleep duration reported by the population. Critically, the sleep duration standard deviation is exceptionally high (Z=3.21), indicating significant inconsistency in sleep length, a common marker of poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is very late (02:07:50 AM), and the sleep start time standard deviation is also high (Z=1.54), suggesting a disrupted and irregular sleep-wake cycle. These objective measures of sleep timing and duration variability strongly suggest poorer sleep quality.

The participant's behavioral patterns also warrant consideration. Despite high engagement in physical activity, the significant time spent in sedentary recreational activities, particularly reading and listening to music, may influence sleep hygiene if not managed appropriately, especially given the late sleep onset. The negative correlation of self-esteem (-0.35) and happiness (-0.27) with PSQI score indicates that a lower sense of self-worth and happiness are associated with worse sleep, which aligns with the participant's slightly lower than average self-esteem.

Considering the significant positive correlations of depressive symptoms and anxiety with PSQI, the objectively measured short and highly variable sleep duration, and the highly irregular sleep schedule, it is likely that the participant's overall PSQI score would fall into the upper half of the study population distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

The participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile, characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z-score -1.18) and anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02), suggesting a stable emotional state. Self-esteem is notably high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 46.0, Z-score 1.1), aligning with a positive outlook. Their reported happiness level is slightly below average (3.0, Z-score -0.53), while stress levels are within the moderate range (19.0, Z-score -0.71). Health satisfaction is above average (5.22, Z-score 0.72), which is congruent with their healthy Body Mass Index (22.31).

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates moderate substance usage, with beer consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score 1.01) and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.19). Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week both alone (Z-score 0.32) and with others (Z-score 0.53), though they do not participate in sports (Z-score -1.09). Daily recreational habits indicate a significant amount of time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), while other sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and internet usage are kept to relatively short durations. Notably, reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as not done.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.26 (Z-score -1.23) and Intradaily Variability of 0.46 (Z-score -0.6). The Mesor (mean heart rate) is 72.96 bpm (Z-score -0.13), which is slightly lower than average, and the Amplitude of 8.46 (Z-score -0.75) indicates a moderate fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The Acrophase, representing the peak heart rate, occurs at 5:43 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is 59.2 bpm (Z-score 0.12), which is slightly above the average resting heart rate for the population. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show a distinct diurnal pattern. Heart rate dips significantly during the early morning hours (3-4 AM: -8.78, Z-score 1.2; 4-5 AM: -11.18, Z-score 1.15), consistent with sleep. It gradually rises throughout the morning and peaks in the late afternoon and early evening (4-5 PM: 10.84, Z-score 0.31).

Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score 0.79), which is longer than the average. However, the variability in sleep duration is quite high, with a standard deviation of 151 minutes (Z-score 1.14). The median sleep start time is late, at 1:32 AM, with moderate variability in sleep start times (82 minutes, Z-score -0.03). There are no reported daily naps. The moderate positive correlation between sleep duration standard deviation and PSQI score (0.21) suggests that greater inconsistency in sleep duration may be associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data offers several indicators relevant to sleep quality. The participant reports a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes, which is longer than the population average, suggesting adequate sleep duration. However, the high standard deviation in sleep duration (151 minutes, Z-score 1.14) indicates significant variability, which has a moderate positive correlation with the PSQI score (0.21), implying potential disruption to sleep consistency. The late median sleep start time (1:32 AM) and its associated moderate variability could also contribute to suboptimal sleep patterns. While the participant exhibits good psychological well-being, characterized by low depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem, and their physiological data suggests a generally regular circadian rhythm, the variability in sleep duration stands out as a potential detractor from optimal sleep quality.

Considering the population PSQI distribution with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0, a significant deviation in sleep duration and a late sleep start time could push this participant towards the higher end of the PSQI score range, indicating poorer sleep quality. The positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSQI score is a key piece of evidence. While other metrics lean towards good or average sleep quality, the inconsistency in sleep duration is a notable concern.

Based on the available evidence, particularly the high variability in sleep duration, and the potential impact of a late sleep start time on sleep quality, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score falls within the higher half of the distribution.

Their reported happiness is slightly below the population mean (Happy Z-score: -0.53), and they report average stress levels (Stress Z-score: 0.1). Notably, the participant reports no substance usage (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all Z-scores < -1.1) and low engagement in solitary exercise, though they do participate in sports 1-2 times a week (Sports Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational habits indicate a preference for passive activities, with limited time spent watching TV/videos, playing video games, or listening to music, and minimal internet usage. Socializing with friends and reading are also limited to brief periods.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data indicates a lower than average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.23) and a below-average mesor (Mesor Z-score: -1.57), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal state. The intradaily variability of heart rate is notably high (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 2.01), suggesting significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, which could be indicative of a less stable physiological rhythm or response to daily stimuli. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:26 PM), which aligns with a typical diurnal pattern, and the amplitude is slightly above average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.19). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal significant dips during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am deviation: -22.65, Z-score: -1.0), with a pronounced peak deviation observed between 11 PM and 12 AM (35.55, Z-score: 4.79). This late-night surge in heart rate deviation from the mesor, preceding their sleep, could be a significant factor influencing sleep quality. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.75) and the aforementioned high intradaily variability.

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.18). However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.47), suggesting consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is late, around 1:45 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.96). There is no reported daily napping behavior (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86).

The participant's PSQI score is likely to fall in the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While the late sleep onset time and the significant hourly heart rate deviation peaking just before midnight are potential concerns, the overall picture suggests a generally healthy psychological profile, no substance abuse, moderate engagement in sports, and a consistent, adequate sleep duration. The positive correlations of several well-being indicators (Self-Esteem, Trust, Health Satisfaction, Happiness) with lower PSQI scores, and the negative correlation of Stress with PSQI, further support this assessment. Although the data does not directly provide the PSQI score, the constellation of factors points towards a favorable sleep quality relative to the study population.

63904,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a complex profile characterized by elevated levels of psychological distress and suboptimal behavioral patterns, which appear to correlate with poorer sleep quality metrics. Self-reported measures indicate significant depressive symptom burden (CES-D score of 30.0, Z-score 1.74) and chronic anxiety proneness (STAI score of 53.0, Z-score 1.16). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 30.0, Z-score -1.15), alongside diminished trust in others (Trust score of 2.17, Z-score -2.07) and lower self-reported happiness (Happy score of 2.0, Z-score -1.61). Despite these internal states, the participant reports average stress levels (Stress score of 23.0, Z-score 0.38) and a generally satisfactory perception of their physical health (Health Satisfaction score of 3.44, Z-score -0.62).

Behavioral data reveals a significant lack of engagement in health-promoting activities. The participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and a complete absence of exercise (exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports). Daily recreational habits are also skewed towards passive engagement, with the participant reporting no time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, listening to music, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. The primary activities reported are internet usage for 2-3 hours daily and socializing with friends for a similar duration.

Physiological data from the wearable device offers further insight. The participant exhibits a resting heart rate of 60.5 bpm (Z-score 0.28), which is within the normative range. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a moderate interdaily stability (Value 0.53, Z-score 1.0) and intradaily variability (Value 0.63, Z-score 0.6), suggesting a somewhat structured but not exceptionally robust daily rhythm. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is 76.66 bpm (Z-score 0.37), and the amplitude of the daily heart rate variation is 10.59 bpm (Z-score -0.06), indicating a relatively moderate fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is identified at 3:36 PM. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., -21.42 at 3-4 AM, -21.13 at 4-5 AM), followed by an increase in heart rate during the mid-morning and afternoon, peaking between 5-6 PM. A notable decline in heart rate deviation is observed in the late evening and early morning.

Sleep statistics highlight significant sleep deprivation and irregularity. The median sleep duration is a concerning 5 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score -1.69), indicating a substantial deficit relative to recommended sleep durations. This is further compounded by a low sleep duration standard deviation of 30 minutes (Z-score -1.61), suggesting a consistent but insufficient sleep pattern. The median sleep start time is very late at 1:34 AM, with a standard deviation of 60 minutes (Z-score -0.5), pointing to irregular sleep onset. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Value 0.0, Z-score -0.86) means there is no compensatory sleep behavior.

The correlations between various metrics and PSQI score are generally weak, with a few exceptions. Notably, higher CES-D scores (indicating more depressive symptoms) show a positive correlation (0.5) with PSQI score, and higher STAI scores (anxiety) also show a positive correlation (0.4). Conversely, higher self-esteem and trust are negatively correlated with PSQI score, as is current happiness. This aligns with the expectation that psychological distress negatively impacts sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, this participant's sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score, is likely to fall within the **top 50%** of the study population, signifying poorer sleep quality. Several key indicators support this conclusion. The most prominent factor is the extremely low median sleep duration of 5 hours and 49 minutes, which is significantly below normative recommendations and is associated with a strong negative correlation with PSQI score. This substantial sleep deficit is a primary driver of poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the late median sleep start time of 1:34 AM, coupled with a significant sleep duration standard deviation, points to disrupted sleep timing, which is also a strong contributor to high PSQI scores.

The psychological profile of the participant further reinforces this assessment. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and chronic anxiety (STAI), along with low self-esteem and happiness, are all positively correlated with PSQI scores, indicating that psychological distress is intertwined with their sleep difficulties. While the participant reports low engagement in physical activity and passive recreational habits, these factors, though not ideal for sleep hygiene, have weaker direct correlations with the PSQI score in this dataset compared to the direct sleep duration and psychological distress measures. The moderate circadian rhythm stability, while not extremely poor, does not appear to be robust enough to overcome the significant sleep duration deficit and timing irregularities. Therefore, the confluence of severe sleep deprivation, irregular sleep schedules, and substantial psychological distress strongly suggests a PSQI score that places this individual in the poorer half of the sleep quality distribution.

20335,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, as indicated by significantly lower-than-average CES-D (Z-score: -1.18) and STAI-Trait scores (Z-score: -1.81). This is complemented by high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66), consistent with a positive self-perception. Happiness levels are also above average (Z-score: 1.64), and stress is reported at a below-average level (Z-score: -0.71). Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score: 1.3), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being. Academic performance, as reflected in their GPA, appears stable and within a good range.

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance use, with alcohol consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.94), and recreational and non-prescribed drug use at minimal levels. They engage in exercise alone with a frequency of three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07), indicating a proactive approach to physical activity. Daily recreational habits reveal a significant allocation of time towards sedentary activities, particularly sedentary hobbies (Z-score: 2.01) and socializing with friends (Z-score: 1.74), with substantial amounts of time also spent listening to music (Z-score: 1.13) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64). Notably, video game engagement is also high (Z-score: 1.71).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.33) and a variability that is not excessively high (Z-score: 0.81). The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly above the population mean (Z-score: 0.57), and the amplitude of the daily heart rate variation is also moderately elevated (Z-score: 0.9). The acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, occurs around 6:06 PM, suggesting a diurnal pattern aligned with typical daily activity. The resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score: -0.37), which is generally considered a positive physiological indicator.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. A significant elevation is observed in the late evening and early night, particularly between 10 PM and 1 AM, with the highest positive deviation of 23.89 occurring between 12 AM and 1 AM (Z-score: 3.66). This is followed by a substantial drop in heart rate during the early morning hours (3 AM to 6 AM), with deviations as low as -26.12 at 6-7 AM (Z-score: -1.21). The period between 7 AM and 9 AM shows a gradual increase in heart rate deviation, with a return to positive deviations in the late afternoon and evening, peaking at 6-7 PM (20.3 Z-score: 1.35). This pattern suggests a physiological state characterized by a delayed sleep onset and a potentially extended period of lower physiological arousal in the early morning.

The participant's sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 35 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.74). The variability in sleep duration is not particularly high (Z-score: -0.33). A significant finding is the late median sleep start time of 1:53 AM, with a relatively low standard deviation (Z-score: -1.24), suggesting a consistent pattern of late sleep onset. The frequency of daily naps is minimal, close to zero (Z-score: 0.04).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a relatively favorable sleep profile, which would likely place them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population regarding their PSQI score, indicating better-than-average sleep quality.

Evidence supporting a low PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile) includes the participant's psychological well-being, characterized by low levels of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem and happiness. While not directly measured by the PSQI, these factors are often associated with better subjective sleep quality. More directly relevant are the wearable data. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average, and their circadian rhythm, while showing some variability, demonstrates moderate interdaily stability. The notable finding regarding sleep duration is a median of 6 hours and 35 minutes, which is below average. However, the consistent, albeit late, sleep start time (median 1:53 AM with low variability) suggests a degree of regularity in their sleep schedule. The high deviation of heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., -26.12 at 6-7 AM) might be indicative of deeper sleep stages or simply a naturally lower physiological arousal during that period, which could contribute to a better subjective sleep experience. The low frequency of naps also points towards consolidated nighttime sleep.

Conversely, there is limited evidence to suggest a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile). The primary indicator that might contribute to a poorer PSQI score is the relatively short sleep duration. However, the PSQI encompasses multiple domains, including sleep latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Without direct PSQI component scores, the overall impact of the observed metrics on the global PSQI score remains inferential. The late sleep onset, while consistent, could potentially contribute to a higher score if it leads to subjective difficulty falling asleep. However, the data does not explicitly detail subjective sleep latency or disturbances.

Holistically, the participant's positive psychological profile, regular but late sleep schedule, and absence of significant behavioral risk factors (e.g., high substance use, significant academic distress) suggest that their sleep quality is likely in the better half of the distribution. The shorter sleep duration is a potential concern, but the consistency of the sleep schedule and the positive psychological state likely mitigate its impact on the overall PSQI score.

35031,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a generally positive psychological profile, characterized by low self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 27.0, Z-score of -1.41), both indicating scores below the population mean. Self-esteem appears to be above average, with a Self-Esteem score of 43.0 and a Z-score of 0.68, suggesting a positive self-perception. Trust levels are slightly below average (Score of 3.0, Z-score of -0.46), as is self-reported happiness (Current score of 3.0, Z-score of -0.53). Stress levels are notably lower than the population average (Score of 18.0, Z-score of -0.98). Health satisfaction is slightly above the population average (Score of 4.44, Z-score of 0.13). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is strong, with scores ranging from 3.53 to 3.88.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, which is above the population average. However, they report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times per week, both alone and with others, and participation in sports at the same frequency. Daily recreational habits include significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour) and moderate internet usage (31 minutes an hour). Socializing with friends is reported as 2-3 hours daily, which is above average. There is limited engagement in listening to music (15 minutes or less) and no reported engagement in video games or reading.

Physiologically, as indicated by Fitbit data, the participant exhibits a lower-than-average interdaily stability of heart rate (Value of 0.19, Z-score of -1.81) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value of 0.1, Z-score of -1.87), suggesting a less regular circadian rhythm. Intradaily variability is higher than average (Value of 0.71, Z-score of 1.16), indicating more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is above average (Value of 82.2, Z-score of 1.13), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is below average (Value of 5.05, Z-score of -1.85), suggesting a flatter daily heart rate profile. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is observed at 5:35 PM. The resting heart rate is significantly elevated above the population mean (Value of 75.5, Z-score of 2.06). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal the most pronounced negative deviations occurring in the early morning hours (3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), suggesting a period of lower physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, positive deviations are observed in the late evening (10-11 PM) and particularly late afternoon (5-6 PM).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 3 minutes, which is longer than the population average and has a positive Z-score (1.08), suggesting sufficient sleep duration. The standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly below average (91 minutes, Z-score of -0.21), suggesting some consistency in sleep length. The median sleep start time is at 00:16:06, which is later than typical and shows a positive Z-score for its standard deviation (96 minutes), indicating variability in sleep onset. The mean daily naps are above average (0.14, Z-score of 0.82), which could potentially impact overall sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To assess the participant's PSQI score relative to the study population, we examine the provided data for indicators of sleep quality. The population mean PSQI score is 6.73, with a standard deviation of 2.16, a 25th percentile of 5.0, a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0, and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A lower PSQI score indicates better sleep quality, while a higher score indicates poorer sleep quality.

Evidence supporting a *lower* PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile, good/average sleep quality) is found in the significantly longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 3 minutes, Z-score 1.08). While not directly provided as a PSQI component, longer sleep duration is generally associated with better sleep quality. Additionally, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, which are often comorbid with poor sleep. Their above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction are also positive indicators.

Conversely, evidence for a *higher* PSQI score (top 50th percentile, poor sleep quality) may be inferred from several factors. The median sleep start time of 00:16:06, coupled with a standard deviation of 96 minutes for sleep start time, suggests potential sleep onset difficulties and irregular sleep schedules, which are core components of the PSQI. The above-average number of daily naps (Z-score 0.82) could also negatively impact sleep continuity and efficiency, contributing to a higher PSQI score. The reduced interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours in heart rate, along with higher intradaily variability, point to a less regular circadian rhythm, which can impair sleep quality. The elevated resting heart rate, though not a direct PSQI measure, might suggest a level of physiological dysregulation that could indirectly affect sleep. The moderate substance use (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) could also contribute to poorer sleep quality.

Holistically evaluating the evidence, the sleep onset irregularity indicated by the later and more variable sleep start times, coupled with the potential impact of napping and the less structured circadian rhythm, weigh significantly towards a less optimal sleep quality profile. While sleep duration is good, the consistency and timing of sleep, along with potential disruptive habits, suggest a PSQI score that is likely not in the lowest quartile of the distribution. Considering the median PSQI is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0, the indicators of irregular sleep timing and rhythm point towards a score that might fall into the upper half of the distribution.

88185,6.0,0.387434554973822,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score -0.66, classified as ""Not depressed"") and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 29.0, Z-score -1.22, classified as ""not anxious""). Their self-esteem appears to be above average (Self-Esteem score of 44.0, Z-Score 0.82), and they report high levels of happiness (Z-Score 1.64). Despite a BMI of 25.09, falling into the overweight category, their self-reported health satisfaction is near average (Score 3.56, Z-score -0.53). Trust in others is also above the study mean (Score 3.67, Z-Score 0.83), and stress levels are below average (Score 20.0, Z-Score -0.44).

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs). Regarding exercise, they engage in exercising alone frequently (Three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.07) but exercise with others and participate in sports less often (Less than 1-2 times a month for both, Z-Scores -0.88 and -0.42 respectively). Their daily recreation habits reveal a notable preference for listening to music for extended periods (more than 4 hours, Z-Score 2.06) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-Score 0.95). They report minimal engagement with watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and moderate internet usage (1-2 hours). Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for very short durations (15 minutes or less).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a robust and regular circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is high (Value 0.57, Z-Score 1.33), suggesting consistent daily patterns. The intradaily variability is moderate (Value 0.5, Z-Score -0.32), indicating a healthy balance between periods of activity and rest within the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value 0.39, Z-Score 0.56) further supports the regularity of the daily rhythm. The participant's mesor (average heart rate over the day) is slightly elevated relative to the population mean (Value 79.49, Z-Score 0.76), and their amplitude is also notably higher (Value 14.05, Z-Score 1.06), suggesting a greater range between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is reported as 5:00 PM. Their resting heart rate is within the average range for the population (Value 57.3, Z-Score -0.1). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a pattern of reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., lowest deviation of -26.06 at 6-7 am), with a gradual increase in heart rate during the morning and afternoon, peaking around midday and early afternoon before decreasing into the evening.

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-Score -0.7). The variability in sleep duration is also lower than the average (62 minutes, Z-Score -0.87), suggesting a more consistent, albeit shorter, sleep pattern. The median sleep start time is quite late, at 02:25:14 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times (88 minutes, Z-Score 0.11). The participant reports no daily naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-Score -0.86).

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's reported sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes is below the population median of 6 hours and 0 minutes, and the Z-score of -0.7 for median sleep duration suggests this is a point towards potentially poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, the standard deviation of sleep duration being 62 minutes (Z-score -0.87) indicates relatively consistent sleep durations, which, when combined with a shorter duration, might point towards a lack of variability that could be beneficial for sleep quality. The late median sleep start time of 02:25:14 AM, while having a moderate standard deviation, is also a factor that could be associated with disrupted sleep schedules. The absence of naps, while potentially indicative of consolidated nighttime sleep, also contributes to the overall sleep intake.

While the participant exhibits many positive psychological and behavioral characteristics, including low anxiety, depression, and stress, and high self-esteem and happiness, these factors do not directly mitigate the objective measures of sleep quantity and timing. The PSQI population data indicates a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. The participant's relatively shorter sleep duration and late sleep onset time, without other strong counteracting sleep quality indicators from the available data, suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality. The weak positive correlations between some sleep metrics (e.g., sleep duration standard deviation, sleep start time standard deviation) and PSQI are noted but do not override the quantitative assessment of sleep duration and timing in relation to the population distribution. Given that the median sleep duration is shorter than the population median, and the sleep start time is significantly delayed, it is plausible that this participant’s PSQI score would fall into the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

This participant presents with elevated levels of psychological distress, characterized by a high score on the CES-D (Z-score of 1.53), indicative of depressive symptoms, and a similarly elevated STAI-Trait score (Z-score of 2.05), suggesting significant chronic anxiety. These findings are associated with positive correlations with the PSQI score, implying that greater distress may contribute to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, self-esteem is notably low (Z-score of -1.57), with a negative correlation to PSQI, suggesting that higher self-worth may be associated with better sleep. Reported happiness is also low (Z-score of -1.61), with a negative correlation to PSQI. Trust in others is also high (Z-score of 1.79), though its correlation with PSQI is weakly negative, suggesting that higher trust may be associated with slightly better sleep quality. Stress levels are moderately elevated (Z-score of 0.65), with a positive correlation to PSQI, aligning with the general expectation that increased stress negatively impacts sleep.

Lifestyle behaviors indicate moderate substance use, with both beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, which have minimal positive correlations with PSQI. Exercise habits are relatively strong, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), while exercising with others and engaging in sports occur less frequently. These exercise patterns exhibit weak negative correlations with PSQI, suggesting a potentially protective effect on sleep quality. Daily recreational habits show a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.64) and moderate internet usage (Z-score of -1.16). Notably, there is a lack of engagement in activities like video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies, with Z-scores indicating below-average engagement for several of these. Most of these recreational habits show small positive correlations with PSQI, with the exception of socializing with friends, which shows a weak negative correlation.

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability (IS) of 0.44 (Z-score of 0.25) and an Intradaily Variability (IV) of 0.56 (Z-score of 0.1). The Autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.36 (Z-score of 0.31), suggesting a moderate degree of daily rhythmicity. The Mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of 78.01 (Z-score of 0.56) and Amplitude of 11.25 (Z-score of 0.15) are within typical ranges. The Acrophase (peak time) is noted at 3:51 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is 63.8 bpm (Z-score of 0.67). Analysis of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor for hourly heart rate reveals patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, there are significant negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1am: -11.58, 1-2am: -13.28, 2-3am: -15.27, 3-4am: -17.27), indicating lower than typical heart rate during these periods, which is expected during sleep. Positive deviations are observed during daylight hours, peaking in the afternoon (e.g., 3-4pm: 12.88, 4-5pm: 13.28), reflecting higher physiological activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 47 minutes (Z-score of 0.74), which is longer than the population average. The standard deviation for sleep duration is 92 minutes, and the standard deviation for sleep start time is 61 minutes (Z-score of -0.48), suggesting some variability in sleep timing. The median sleep start time is 00:03:03. The absence of daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) is also noted. The correlations between sleep statistics and PSQI are largely negligible, with a slight positive correlation for sleep duration standard deviation and a slight negative correlation for sleep start time standard deviation.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant exhibits a complex profile concerning their sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI. On one hand, the PSQI population data reveals a mean score of 6.72, with a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0. This participant's elevated CES-D and STAI scores, coupled with low self-esteem and happiness, suggest a predisposition towards poorer sleep quality, as these psychological factors are positively correlated with PSQI. Furthermore, the participant's moderate stress levels also correlate positively with PSQI.

However, several factors might contribute to better sleep quality or place the participant in the lower half of the distribution. The median sleep duration of nearly 8 hours is on the longer side, and while the standard deviation of sleep duration is noted, the overall duration itself is generally considered conducive to good sleep. The absence of daily naps is also a positive indicator. The participant's active lifestyle with regular exercise, though not perfectly balanced across all types, may offer some protective benefits for sleep. Moreover, the wearable data suggests a generally stable circadian rhythm, which is a cornerstone of good sleep regulation.

Considering the mixed evidence, the psychological distress indicators (depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness) are strong predictors of poorer sleep and are positively correlated with PSQI. While the objective sleep duration and circadian rhythmicity appear relatively sound, the significant psychological burden is likely to outweigh these benefits in determining the overall PSQI score. Given that the 75th percentile for PSQI is 8.0, and the high levels of psychological distress are directly linked to increased PSQI scores, it is more probable that this participant's PSQI score falls into the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality relative to the study population.

This participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant deviations in several psychological and behavioral domains. Subjectively, the participant reports moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 12.0, Z-score -0.14) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 40.0, Z-score -0.13), which fall within the average range for the study population. However, self-esteem is notably high (SelfEsteem score of 41.0, Z-Score 0.4, which is near the ceiling of the measure and thus interpreted as a high score, despite the positive Z-score), suggesting a resilient sense of self. Happiness is reported as low (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z-Score -0.53), indicating a potential disconnect between self-worth and subjective well-being. Stress levels are elevated (Stress score of 24.0, Z-Score 0.65), aligning with higher values indicating greater stress. Health satisfaction is also below average (Health Satisfaction score of 5.11, Z-score 0.63), suggesting a perception of poorer physical health despite a healthy Body Mass Index (21.28).

Behaviorally, this participant exhibits a high frequency of substance use, with regular consumption of beer and wine/liquor (1-2 times a week for both, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), placing them in the higher range of usage within the population. In contrast, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Physical activity is mixed; the participant engages in solo exercise and sports with high frequency (three times a week or more for both, with Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.58 respectively), indicating a strong commitment to physical activity when performed alone or in organized sports. However, exercise with others is notably absent (Frequency: Not at all, Z-Score -1.58), suggesting a preference for solitary forms of physical exertion. Daily recreational habits are characterized by significant time spent on passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-Score 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score 0.85), alongside substantial time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-Score 1.13). Notably, social interaction with friends occupies a substantial portion of their day (3-4 hours, Z-Score 1.74), indicating a high level of social engagement despite other sedentary habits. Video games and reading are not pursued as leisure activities.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant demonstrates a generally regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by a relatively low Intradaily Variability (Value 0.3, Z-Score -1.73), suggesting consistent daily patterns in heart rate. The MESOR, representing the average heart rate around which the rhythm oscillates, is lower than the population average (Value 64.59, Z-Score -1.28), which is consistent with a lower resting heart rate (Value 57.8, Z-Score -0.04). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also below average (Value 8.28, Z-Score -0.81), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is reported at 3:34 PM. The deviation from the mesor highlights significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Notably, there are pronounced positive deviations during the afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 2-3 PM, 3-4 PM, 4-5 PM show deviations of +13.19, +12.10, and +13.27 respectively), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM) show significant negative deviations (-12.32, -11.40, -11.66 respectively), indicating lower than usual heart rate during these periods.

Sleep statistics reveal a remarkably long median sleep duration (9 hours 34 minutes, Z-Score 2.96), which is significantly longer than the population average. This is further underscored by a high standard deviation in sleep duration (249 minutes, Z-Score 3.37), suggesting considerable variability in how long the participant sleeps on a nightly basis. The median sleep start time is late, around 23:17, with a moderate standard deviation (84 minutes, Z-Score 0.03). The presence of daily naps is minimal (0.08, Z-Score 0.12). The positive correlation of sleep duration and its variability with PSQI score (0.04 and 0.2 respectively) suggests that longer sleep and greater variability in sleep duration may be associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI score ranking, we must consider the available evidence related to potential indicators of sleep quality. The population's PSQI scores have a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A score above the median would indicate being in the top 50% (poorer sleep quality), while a score at or below the median would place them in the bottom 50% (better or average sleep quality).

Evidence suggesting potentially poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI score):
*   **Sleep Duration and Variability:** The participant exhibits a significantly longer median sleep duration (9 hours 34 minutes) and a notably high standard deviation in sleep duration (249 minutes). The correlations provided indicate positive associations between sleep duration and its variability with the PSQI score. While long sleep can sometimes be indicative of restorative sleep, excessive variability and duration, especially without corresponding improvements in subjective sleep quality, can be a marker of disrupted sleep architecture or other underlying issues that contribute to a higher PSQI score.
*   **Stress Levels:** Elevated stress (Z-Score 0.65) is often correlated with poorer sleep quality and can directly impact the PSQI score through various domains such as sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction.
*   **Low Happiness:** While not directly a PSQI domain, low subjective happiness can often co-occur with poor sleep quality and contribute to a negative overall sleep experience, potentially impacting PSQI scores related to subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction.

Evidence suggesting potentially better or average sleep quality (lower PSQI score):
*   **Low Intradaily Variability in Heart Rate:** The low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-Score -1.73) suggests a degree of physiological regularity, which can be indicative of better-regulated physiological processes, potentially including sleep.
*   **Low Resting Heart Rate:** A lower resting heart rate (Z-Score -0.04) is generally considered a positive physiological indicator.
*   **Socializing with Friends:** High engagement in socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-Score 1.74) can be a positive indicator of well-being and social support, which may indirectly contribute to better sleep.
*   **Frequency of Sports and Exercised Alone:** High frequency of engaging in sports and exercising alone could indicate a lifestyle that promotes physical health, which can positively influence sleep quality.

However, the most salient data points directly relevant to sleep quality and its common correlates are the sleep duration statistics and the presence of elevated stress. The exceptionally long and variable sleep duration, coupled with positive correlations to the PSQI score, strongly suggests that this participant's sleep patterns are contributing to poorer sleep quality. The elevated stress levels also provide a plausible mechanism for sleep disruption. While some physiological metrics show regularity, the behavioral and subjective aspects related to sleep duration and stress lean towards indicating a higher PSQI score. Given the population median of 6.0 and 75th percentile of 8.0, and the strong indicators of sleep duration variability and stress, it is more likely that this participant's PSQI score falls into the upper half of the distribution, signifying poorer sleep quality.

58793,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several notable psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their sleep quality. Their reported anxiety levels are moderately elevated (STAI Z-score of 0.46), placing them above the study population mean. Conversely, they report lower-than-average happiness (Z-score of -0.53) and higher-than-average trust (Z-score of 0.83), which is an interesting interplay. Depression symptomology is within the non-depressed range (CESD Z-score of -0.34). Self-esteem is also relatively high (RSES Z-score of -0.73), suggesting that their anxiety may not be deeply rooted in self-perception. Their health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score of 1.3), indicating a positive outlook on their physical well-being.

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.94), while reporting infrequent beer consumption and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Their exercise habits are robust, with frequent solitary and group exercise (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), and regular participation in sports (Z-score of 0.91). They dedicate considerable time to socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score of 1.74), which is a significant deviation from the population average. Notably, they report very little engagement in sedentary recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, or reading, with internet usage being the only reported digital activity at 1-2 hours.

From a physiological perspective derived from wearable data, the participant displays a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.06). Their mean heart rate (Mesor) is elevated compared to the population (Z-score of 0.77), and their amplitude is also high (Z-score of 1.0), suggesting a significant daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (3:45 PM), aligning with typical daily activity patterns. Their resting heart rate is near the population average (Z-score of 0.07). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. There are significant negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.1 to -2.38), indicating periods of reduced cardiovascular activity, likely corresponding to sleep. Conversely, pronounced positive deviations are observed in the mid-morning (8-9 AM, Z-score of 3.52) and afternoon (2-3 PM and 4-5 PM, Z-scores of 2.03 and 2.0 respectively), reflecting periods of higher physiological arousal. This pattern suggests a robust daily rhythm with clear distinctions between rest and activity periods.

Sleep statistics indicate a notably long median sleep duration of over 9 hours (Z-score of 2.3), which is significantly longer than the population average. The variability in sleep duration is close to the population average (Z-score of -0.15). Their median sleep start time is late in the evening (approximately 11:15 PM), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score of 0.46), suggesting some variability but not extreme irregularity. The participant reports very few daily naps (Z-score of -0.02).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely falls into the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

Several factors support this conclusion. The participant exhibits a significantly longer median sleep duration (over 9 hours, Z-score of 2.3) than the population mean, which is a strong indicator of good sleep quantity. While their sleep start time is late (around 11:15 PM), the variability in this timing is moderate. The absence of daily naps further suggests consistent nocturnal sleep patterns.

Furthermore, the physiological data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm, evidenced by a high autocorrelation at 24 hours. While the participant's resting heart rate is within the average range, the pattern of heart rate deviations from the Mesor shows clear periods of reduced activity during the night, aligning with expected sleep physiology, and heightened activity during the day. The high health satisfaction score (Z-score of 1.3) also indirectly suggests a positive overall well-being, which often correlates with better sleep.

While the participant reports elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score of 0.46), this is not a particularly high score relative to the population and is not strongly correlated with PSQI scores in this dataset. The absence of significant depressive symptoms and the presence of high self-esteem further mitigate concerns about psychological factors negatively impacting sleep. Their extensive engagement in physical activities and socializing, coupled with minimal sedentary recreation, points towards a generally active lifestyle, which is often conducive to better sleep hygiene. The low correlation coefficients between most of the measured variables and PSQI score, and particularly the negative correlations for variables that generally improve sleep (e.g., health satisfaction, social engagement), suggest that the participant's sleep quality is likely not significantly impaired by these factors.

Given the combination of long sleep duration, a generally regular circadian rhythm, and the absence of strongly negative psychological indicators that are highly correlated with poor sleep, it is reasonable to infer that this participant’s PSQI score is likely within the lower half of the distribution.

96689,6.0,0.387434554973822,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a moderate level of reported anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 47.0, which falls above the population mean, though the Z-score of 0.56 suggests it is not exceptionally high within the study group. Concurrently, their self-esteem score of 39.0 is near the population average, with a low Z-score of 0.11, indicating a neutral disposition towards self-worth. Despite these scores, the participant reports a relatively low level of overall happiness, with a Z-score of -0.53. Notably, their reported health satisfaction is significantly low, with a Z-score of -1.61, suggesting a notable dissatisfaction with their physical health within the study population.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational, or non-prescribed drugs), with Z-scores for all categories being substantially below zero, indicating a significantly lower prevalence compared to the study population. Similarly, engagement in physical activity is minimal, with reported frequencies of ""Not at all"" for exercising alone, exercising with others, and sports, reflected in highly negative Z-scores. Daily recreational activities reveal a preference for less demanding pursuits, with significant time spent on internet usage (1-2 hours), listening to music (16-30 minutes), and reading (15 minutes or less), while social interaction with friends is reported for 2-3 hours daily. Notably, there is no reported engagement in watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.08). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals an amplitude of 14.98, which is notably higher than the population average (Z-score of 1.36), suggesting a wider fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 5:14 PM. The hourly mean heart rate deviation from the mesor displays distinct patterns. There is a significant dip in heart rate deviation during the early morning hours (2-7 AM), with values as low as -24.78, indicating a period of significantly lower physiological arousal. Conversely, the evening hours, particularly from 6 PM onwards, show a marked increase in heart rate deviation, peaking between 6-7 PM (21.88) and again between 8-10 PM (17.42-18.59), suggesting elevated physiological activity during these times.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above the population mean (Z-score of 0.14), suggesting adequate duration. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is notably low (38 minutes, Z-score of -1.42), implying highly consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around 1:55 AM, which is later than the population average. The standard deviation of sleep start time is also relatively low (29 minutes, Z-score of -1.19), suggesting a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. There are no reported daily naps.

### Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a complex picture regarding their overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On one hand, several indicators suggest potentially good sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes is within recommended ranges, and the low standard deviation of sleep duration indicates remarkable consistency. Similarly, the low standard deviation of sleep start time suggests a predictable sleep schedule, which is generally conducive to good sleep hygiene. The absence of substance use and a lack of engagement in sedentary screen-based leisure activities like watching TV or playing video games can also be viewed positively. Furthermore, the participant exhibits a relatively low reported stress level.

However, there are also factors that may indicate a poorer sleep quality. The participant reports a significantly low health satisfaction (Z-score of -1.61), which can be a precursor to or consequence of poor sleep. While not overtly depressed, their reported happiness is also below average. The most notable finding regarding sleep timing is the median sleep start time of approximately 1:55 AM, which, coupled with the consistent, albeit late, pattern, may reflect a delayed sleep phase. The high amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-score of 1.36) suggests significant daily fluctuations in physiological arousal, which could disrupt sleep continuity. The elevated heart rate deviations in the evening hours, particularly from 6 PM onwards, may also interfere with the ability to initiate sleep at a more socially desirable or optimal time. The positive correlations with PSQI score for depression (0.49), anxiety (0.4), and stress (0.2) suggest that even moderate levels of these psychological states can contribute to poorer sleep quality. Given that the population mean PSQI is 6.73 and the 75th percentile is 8.0, a score within the range of 7 or higher would place them in the top 50% of the distribution, indicative of poorer sleep. The combination of potential disruption from evening arousal patterns and elevated psychological distress, despite consistent duration, suggests a likelihood of impaired sleep quality.

Considering the evidence holistically, the delayed and consistent sleep start time, the higher circadian amplitude, and the evening period of heightened physiological arousal, in conjunction with the positive correlations between psychological distress indicators (anxiety, depression, stress) and the PSQI, suggest that this participant likely experiences sleep quality that would place them in the top 50% of the study population, indicating poorer sleep.

33657,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a moderate level of depressive symptomatology, with a CES-D score of 16.0 (Z-score: 0.28), placing them within the ""Depressed"" classification. While this suggests a potential impact on their well-being, their trait anxiety levels are relatively low, indicated by a STAI score of 37.0 (Z-score: -0.43), classifying them as ""not anxious."" Self-esteem is slightly above average, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 41.0 (Z-score: 0.4), and they report a happiness level of 4.0 (Z-score: 0.55). Trust in others is also slightly elevated at 3.5 (Z-score: 0.5). Conversely, their perceived stress levels are within the average range, with a score of 20.0 (Z-score: -0.44). Health satisfaction is also slightly above average at 4.56 (Z-score: 0.22).

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant consumes alcohol (beer, wine, or liquor) 1-2 times per week, which are Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively, indicating higher than average consumption within the study population. They do not report using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise frequency is notably low, particularly in sports (Z-score: -1.09). They engage in individual exercise 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32) and exercise with others 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -0.17). Daily recreational activities are characterized by minimal engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games. They report moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85) and listening to music (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.21). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.16), and they do not engage in reading. A significant finding is the high reported time spent on sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 3.19), indicating a largely inactive lifestyle outside of planned exercise.

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a moderately regular circadian rhythm, though with some variability. The mesor of 63.24 (Z-score: -1.46) indicates a lower than average resting heart rate. The amplitude of 7.12 (Z-score: -1.18) suggests a moderate daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, occurring at 3:16 PM, is not provided with a Z-score for direct comparison to the population. Interdaily stability (IS) is at 0.35 (Z-score: -0.49), suggesting some regularity in daily cycles, while intradaily variability (IV) is 0.65 (Z-score: 0.74), indicating a higher than average degree of fluctuation within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.28 (Z-score: -0.36), suggesting moderate day-to-day predictability of heart rate patterns. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals pronounced dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score: 0.77; 4-5 AM, Z-score: 0.49; 5-6 AM, Z-score: 0.30; 6-7 AM, Z-score: -0.05), which is a typical pattern reflecting sleep. There is a notable elevation in heart rate deviation during the late morning to early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, Z-score: 2.71; 11 AM-12 PM, Z-score: 1.01). Conversely, heart rate deviations are significantly lower during the evening and night hours (e.g., 7-8 PM, Z-score: -2.26; 8-9 PM, Z-score: -1.26; 9-10 PM, Z-score: -1.37; 10-11 PM, Z-score: -0.96). The participant's resting heart rate is 51.2 bpm (Z-score: -0.83), which is below the population average.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score: -0.13), which is close to the population average. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 63 minutes (Z-score: -0.85), suggesting relatively consistent sleep durations night-to-night. The median sleep start time is at 1:42 AM, with a standard deviation of 64 minutes (Z-score: -0.42), indicating some variability in bedtime but not extreme. The mean number of daily naps is 0.26 (Z-score: 2.23), which is significantly higher than the population average, suggesting a tendency towards napping.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The PSQI population statistics indicate a mean score of 6.73, with a 50th percentile (median) of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. This suggests that scores above 6.0 generally fall into the top 50% of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality.

Evidence for a low or median PSQI score (bottom 50th percentile) would be consistent with consistently good sleep duration, regular sleep start times, low variability in sleep patterns, and positive self-reported sleep quality metrics. While this participant has a median sleep duration close to the average and a relatively low standard deviation for both sleep duration and sleep start time, suggesting some stability in their sleep schedule, their median sleep start time of 1:42 AM is quite late. The higher than average number of daily naps (Z-score: 2.23) is also a potential indicator of poor sleep quality, as it can reflect insufficient or disrupted sleep during the night.

Evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile) would be indicated by significant sleep disturbances, irregular sleep schedules, short sleep durations, and poor subjective sleep quality. The participant's late sleep start time and frequent napping could contribute to a higher PSQI score. The correlation between median sleep start time and PSQI score is 0.18, suggesting a slight positive association, meaning later sleep start times are associated with worse PSQI scores. The correlation for mean daily naps and PSQI score is 0.18, also suggesting a positive association. While the direct PSQI score is not provided, the combination of a late sleep start time and increased napping habits points towards potential difficulties in achieving restorative sleep. The moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D score 16.0, correlation 0.49) also positively correlate with PSQI scores, suggesting that mood may be impacting sleep quality.

Holistically analyzing the available evidence, the participant's late sleep start time, frequent napping, and moderate depressive symptoms are significant indicators that likely contribute to a PSQI score falling into the higher half of the distribution, suggesting poorer sleep quality relative to the study population.

36117,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis of Sleep Quality

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that likely influence their sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Self-reported data indicates a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16.0, Z-score 0.28), which is positively correlated with PSQI score (0.49), suggesting that increased depressive symptomatology may be associated with poorer sleep. Anxiety levels are reported as low (STAI score of 38.0, Z-score -0.33). Self-esteem is notably high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 45.0, Z-score 0.96), and this is negatively correlated with PSQI score (-0.36), indicating that higher self-esteem may be linked to better sleep. Similarly, higher reported happiness (Current happiness score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64) and trust (Trust score of 4.17, Z-score 1.79) are negatively correlated with PSQI (-0.27 and -0.21, respectively), suggesting these positive psychological states may contribute to improved sleep quality. Stress levels are relatively low (Stress score of 21.0, Z-score -0.17), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI (0.2). Overall health satisfaction is also below average for the population (Health Satisfaction score of 3.44, Z-score -0.62).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a month, with minimal correlation to PSQI. They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits reveal a discrepancy: they report exercising alone not at all (Frequency Z-score -1.93), yet engage in exercise with others three times a week or more (Frequency Z-score 1.23), and participate in sports not at all (Frequency Z-score -1.09). The correlation of these exercise variables with PSQI is negligible. Daily recreational habits are characterized by high internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.19) and extensive socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.53). These high-engagement activities have weak positive and negative correlations with PSQI respectively (0.11 and -0.06), suggesting a complex relationship with sleep. Watching TV/videos/movies for 1-2 hours (Z-score 1.28) and sedentary hobbies for more than 4 hours (Z-score 3.19) are also notable time commitments, with weak positive correlations to PSQI.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a robust and regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability (Value 0.55, Z-score 1.16) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value 0.47, Z-score 1.23) are both elevated, suggesting consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Intradaily Variability (Value 0.27, Z-score -1.94) is low, indicating a smooth rather than fragmented daily heart rate profile. The participant has a high Mesor (Value 88.9, Z-score 2.04) and Amplitude (Value 15.67, Z-score 1.58), suggesting a higher baseline heart rate and a more pronounced daily fluctuation, respectively. The acrophase (peak heart rate) occurs at 5:06 PM. Their resting heart rate is also elevated for the population (Value 72.0, Z-score 1.65), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI (0.12). Analysis of hourly deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM deviation -19.85, 4-5 AM deviation -20.78, 5-6 AM deviation -23.84), consistent with sleep. Conversely, heart rates tend to deviate positively from the mesor in the late afternoon and evening, peaking between 7-9 PM. Notably, several evening and nighttime hourly deviations show moderate positive correlations with PSQI, particularly the 2-3 AM (0.2), 3-4 AM (0.23), 7-8 PM (0.04), and 8-9 PM (0.03) periods.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes (Z-score 0.58), which is slightly longer than the population average, with a low standard deviation in duration (93 minutes, Z-score -0.18), indicating consistent sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is very late at 1:13:30 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (100 minutes, Z-score 0.37), suggesting a tendency towards irregular or delayed sleep onset. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps value 0.0, Z-score -0.86) is also noteworthy. The correlations of sleep duration and start time with PSQI are relatively low (0.05 and 0.18, respectively).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score is likely to fall within the **bottom 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While there are some indicators of potential sleep disruption, such as the late median sleep start time and the positive correlation between certain nighttime heart rate deviations and PSQI, these are outweighed by several factors suggesting better sleep. Their self-reported happiness and trust levels are high and negatively correlated with PSQI. Their high self-esteem also shows a negative correlation with PSQI, further supporting better sleep quality. Furthermore, their consistent sleep duration and low intradaily heart rate variability point towards a structured sleep pattern. Although their CES-D score is in the 'Depressed' classification, its positive correlation with PSQI is moderate, and other psychological indicators are more favorable. The strong circadian rhythm metrics (high interdaily stability, autocorrelation, and low intradaily variability) also suggest an underlying physiological regularity that is conducive to good sleep. The relatively consistent sleep duration also leans towards a better sleep profile. The presence of negative correlations between positive psychological traits (happiness, trust, self-esteem) and PSQI, coupled with strong circadian regularity, suggests that this participant likely experiences sleep quality within the average or better range of the study population.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and anxiety (STAI score of 36.0, Z-score -0.52), suggesting a generally stable emotional state. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 41.0, exceeding the typical range of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and a positive Z-score of 0.4. Happiness levels are also elevated, indicated by a Z-score of 1.64 for the 'Happy' metric. Conversely, reported stress levels are moderate, with a score of 19.0 and a Z-score of -0.71, suggesting a lower than average perceived stress. Trust in others is also above average, with a Z-score of 0.83. Health satisfaction is slightly below average, with a score of 3.22 (Z-score -0.78). Academic performance is exceptionally high, with consistent perfect GPAs across multiple semesters.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports infrequent alcohol consumption (beer: 1-2 times a month, Z-score 0.3; wine or liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94). Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency is mixed; solitary exercise is low (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.43), while exercise with others and participation in sports occur with moderate regularity (1-2 times a week, Z-scores 0.53 and 0.91 respectively). Daily recreational activities show a tendency towards passive engagement. The participant spends approximately 31 minutes an hour watching TV/Videos/Movies (Z-score 0.64) and engaging with the internet (Z-score -0.49). Listening to music is for shorter durations (16-30 minutes, Z-score -0.26). Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes an hour (Z-score -0.62), which is lower than average. Reading is for short periods (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32), and sedentary hobbies are not engaged in (Z-score -0.96).

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a resting heart rate of 56.0 bpm (Z-score -0.26), indicating a slightly lower than average resting heart rate. The mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is 72.24 bpm (Z-score -0.23), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 9.67 bpm (Z-score -0.36), suggesting a moderate daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:43 PM. The circadian rhythm exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Value 0.42, Z-score 0.09) and intradaily variability (Value 0.53, Z-score -0.11), with a moderately strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value 0.41, Z-score 0.73), indicating a reasonably structured daily pattern.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, there are significant negative deviations (indicating heart rate below the mesor) during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, -13.43; 4-5 AM, -15.6; 5-6 AM, -16.01). Conversely, positive deviations (heart rate above the mesor) are observed during the mid-afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM, 17.66; 1-2 PM, 13.89; 2-3 PM, 13.49). These patterns suggest a physiological state where heart rate dips considerably during the night and elevates in the afternoon, aligning with typical diurnal rhythms but with marked fluctuations.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is significantly shorter than the average (Z-score -1.58). The standard deviation of sleep duration is 94 minutes, which is close to the population average (Z-score -0.16). The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:57:29, with a standard deviation of 110 minutes, suggesting variability in sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is very low (0.07, Z-score -0.02).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's sleep quality, as indicated by the provided metrics, suggests a likely placement in the **bottom_50** of the study population's PSQI score distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The most salient indicator for this conclusion is the significantly short median sleep duration of 5 hours and 55 minutes, which has a Z-score of -1.58. This substantially lower than average sleep duration strongly correlates with poorer sleep quality, which would lead to a higher PSQI score.

While the participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile with low reported depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, happiness, and trust, these factors do not directly compensate for the objective measure of sleep duration. The high academic achievement and moderate engagement in social and physical activities could indicate good daytime functioning despite potential sleep deficits. However, the extremely late median sleep start time, while exhibiting variability, is also indicative of potential sleep disruption.

The PSQI is designed to measure subjective sleep quality, and short sleep duration is a significant contributor to a higher (worse) PSQI score. Given the substantial deficit in sleep duration, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. However, the prompt asks for a conclusion on whether the participant's *overall sleep quality* places them in the top or bottom half of the distribution *with regards to their PSQI score*. A *high PSQI score* represents *poor sleep quality*. Therefore, a significantly short sleep duration, which is a strong indicator of poor sleep quality, would lead to a high PSQI score, placing the participant in the *top 50%* for PSQI score.

Revisiting the interpretation of ""top 50%"" vs ""bottom 50%"": A ""top 50%"" PSQI score indicates relatively poor sleep quality, while a ""bottom 50%"" PSQI score indicates relatively good or average sleep quality. The participant's short sleep duration is a significant indicator of *poor sleep quality*. Therefore, this participant is likely to have a *high* PSQI score. A high PSQI score places them in the *top 50%* of the distribution for PSQI score.

Happiness levels are also above average, although not extremely so (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Stress levels are slightly elevated but within a moderate range (Stress Z-score: 0.38). Trust in others is also reported as high (Trust Z-score: 1.47). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently strong across multiple semesters.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week) with infrequent beer consumption (Less than 1-2 times a month) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week both alone and with others, though participation in sports is absent. Daily recreational activities lean towards passive consumption, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies and moderate internet usage. Listening to music and socializing with friends are reported for shorter durations. Reading and playing video games are not regular activities.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a higher than average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 2.09) and a significantly higher mesor (Mesor Z-score: 2.03), suggesting a generally elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.32) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: -1.54), indicating less regularity in daily physiological cycles. Intradaily variability is within the population average (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.17). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the early evening (6:15 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pronounced dip during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM to 6-7 AM showing Z-scores between 0.62 and 1.33), which is atypical and suggests a pattern of physiological suppression during these times. Conversely, there is a notable elevation in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 6-7 PM showing a Z-score of -0.02, and 9-10 PM showing 8.55).

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.1), with a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration. However, the median sleep start time is significantly later than average (Median Sleep Start Time: 02:18:20) with a high standard deviation (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 1.89), suggesting considerable variability in sleep onset. The participant also reports no daily naps. The correlations with PSQI scores are generally weak across most measures, with a few exceptions including CES-D (0.5), STAI (0.4), and Stress (0.2), suggesting that higher levels of these psychological constructs are mildly associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem (-0.35), trust (-0.21), and health satisfaction (-0.21) are weakly associated with better sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we will holistically consider the available data in relation to population norms for PSQI scores (Mean: 6.72, SD: 2.16, 25th percentile: 5.0, 50th percentile: 6.0, 75th percentile: 8.0). A higher PSQI score indicates poorer sleep quality.

Evidence for potentially better sleep quality (bottom 50th percentile) includes the participant's low scores on depressive symptoms (CESD) and anxiety (STAI), which often correlate with better sleep. Their high self-esteem and health satisfaction also suggest a generally positive disposition that can be conducive to good sleep. Furthermore, the participant reports a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 4 minutes).

Conversely, evidence suggesting poorer sleep quality (top 50th percentile) is primarily derived from the sleep start times and associated variability. A median sleep start time of 02:18:20, coupled with a high standard deviation in sleep start time (169 minutes), strongly indicates significant sleep schedule irregularity, a key contributor to poor sleep quality. The pronounced dips in heart rate during early morning hours may also reflect fragmented or disturbed sleep architecture, despite the longer reported duration. While the correlation analyses with specific survey measures are generally weak, the small positive correlations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress with PSQI suggest that any subclinical elevations in these areas, even within the ""not depressed"" or ""not anxious"" classifications, could contribute to poorer sleep.

Considering the significant disruption indicated by the highly variable and late sleep start times, which is a direct and substantial indicator of poor sleep regulation, this factor carries considerable weight. While other indicators of psychological well-being are positive, the objective and subjective data on sleep timing point towards a significant challenge in establishing a regular sleep pattern. Therefore, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing poorer sleep quality.

78657,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a generally low level of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 12.0, Z-score -0.14) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 38.0, Z-score -0.33), suggesting a relatively stable psychological state in these domains. Self-esteem appears to be within the average range, as indicated by a Self-Esteem score of 39.0 and a positive Z-score of 0.11, suggesting a healthy sense of self-worth. Notably, this metric shows a moderate negative correlation with PSQI score, implying higher self-esteem is associated with better sleep quality. Happiness is reported at a moderate level (3.0 on an unspecified scale, Z-score -0.53), with a mild negative correlation to PSQI score. Health satisfaction is notably low (2.22, Z-score -1.53), indicating dissatisfaction with physical health, which is negatively correlated with PSQI score. Stress levels are below average (17.0, Z-score -1.26), a factor that generally correlates positively with PSQI scores, suggesting higher stress is linked to poorer sleep.

Behavioral habits indicate regular engagement in physical activity, with exercise occurring alone and with others three times a week or more, reflected in high Z-scores for these frequencies (1.07 and 1.23 respectively). This is associated with a slight negative correlation with PSQI score, hinting that regular exercise might contribute to better sleep. Substance use, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week, with positive Z-scores (1.01 and 0.94 respectively), and shows minimal correlation with PSQI. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all,"" with negative Z-scores. Daily recreation includes significant time spent listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.6) and playing video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 1.71), both of which have positive correlations with PSQI score, suggesting these activities may be linked to poorer sleep quality. Internet usage and socializing with friends are also reported at moderate levels.

Wearable data reveals a degree of circadian rhythm disruption. The Interdaily Stability (0.31, Z-score -0.82) is low, indicating less consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (0.67, Z-score 0.88) is high, suggesting significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor (68.81, Z-score -0.7) is lower than average, and the Acrophase (6:50 PM) indicates a relatively late peak in heart rate rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows marked deviations from the Mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM, with significant negative deviations (e.g., -20.15 at 6-7 AM, Z-score -0.4). Conversely, significant positive deviations are observed in the evening, peaking between 7-8 PM (20.28, Z-score 1.53) and continuing into the late evening. These patterns suggest a physiological arousal during times typically associated with sleep and reduced arousal during the day. Resting heart rate is within the lower range (53.4, Z-score -0.56).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is below average for the population (Z-score -0.85), and a relatively high variability in sleep start times (123 minutes, Z-score 0.88). The median sleep start time is notably late, at 03:38:30 AM. The standard deviation for sleep duration is also somewhat elevated, suggesting inconsistency. The absence of daily naps (0.0, Z-score -0.86) is noted. These sleep duration and timing metrics show moderate positive correlations with PSQI scores, indicating that shorter and more variable sleep patterns are associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score is likely to be in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. This conclusion is supported by several factors. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes is below the population median and shows a negative correlation with PSQI, suggesting a contribution to poorer sleep quality. The highly variable sleep start time, with a median around 3:38 AM, and its positive correlation with PSQI, further points towards disrupted sleep patterns. The significant negative deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours, coupled with elevated positive deviations in the evening, as observed in the aggregated hourly heart rate data, suggest a physiological state not conducive to restorative sleep. Furthermore, while the participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, their low health satisfaction and high engagement in activities like video gaming and listening to music for extended periods, which show positive correlations with PSQI, may be exacerbating underlying sleep issues. The low interdaily stability in their circadian rhythm further supports the notion of irregular sleep-wake cycles.

48154,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile, characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -1.07) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.12), suggesting a stable and non-distressed mental state. Their self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score: 1.64), and they report a strong sense of self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66), which aligns with higher trust in others (Z-score: 0.83). Academic performance is consistently strong across reported semesters (GPAs ranging from 3.47 to 3.54). Health satisfaction is also moderately high (Z-score: 0.47), and their Body Mass Index (23.2) falls within a healthy range.

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed pattern. While the participant reports exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07) and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91), their engagement in exercising with others is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score: -0.88). Alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.94), while beer consumption is less frequent (1-2 times a month, Z-score: 0.3). Recreational drug usage is minimal. Daily leisure activities show a moderate amount of internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16). Notably, the participant reports engaging in sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies for 16-30 minutes (Z-score: 0.01), playing video games not at all (Z-score: -0.56), and reading not at all (Z-score: -0.67), indicating a potential deficit in activities promoting cognitive engagement or relaxation.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Value: 0.26, Z-score: -1.23), suggesting some variability in daily patterns, yet the intradaily variability is within the average range (Value: 0.56, Z-score: 0.1). The mesor (average heart rate) is within a normal range (Value: 68.26, Z-score: -0.78), and the amplitude of the daily rhythm is moderate (Value: 8.57, Z-score: -0.71). The acrophase, indicating the peak in the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:29 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly lower than the population average (Value: 56.0, Z-score: -0.26). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, deviation: -13.92) and higher than average heart rate in the early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, deviation: 18.24). This suggests a typical diurnal pattern of physiological activity.

Sleep statistics indicate a tendency towards longer sleep durations, with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score: 1.08), which is above the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is moderate (64 minutes, Z-score: -0.85), suggesting some consistency in sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is quite late (1:03 AM), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is also notable (72 minutes, Z-score: -0.24), indicating potential variability in bedtime. The absence of daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) is also observed. While the PSQI score correlations are generally weak, the moderate positive correlation between CES-D and PSQI score (0.49) suggests that higher depressive symptoms, even if not clinically significant in this case, might be associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem and happiness show a negative correlation with PSQI, implying that better psychological well-being is linked to better sleep quality.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's data provides several indicators that suggest their overall sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, likely places them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 8 hours and 3 minutes is above the population average, and while sleep start times are late and variable, the overall duration is a significant factor in positive sleep quality. The positive psychological profile, characterized by low depression and anxiety, high happiness and self-esteem, and good health satisfaction, generally correlates with better sleep outcomes. Although there is some variability in sleep start times, the absence of naps and the consistently long sleep duration are strong indicators of good sleep hygiene. The weak correlations of most behavioral and physiological metrics with PSQI do not strongly suggest poor sleep. Given the significant positive indicators like prolonged sleep duration and positive psychological well-being, it is reasonable to infer that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the better half of the distribution.

21793,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that may influence their sleep quality. Psychologically, they report moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 15, Z-score 0.18) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 43, Z-score 0.17), though these scores fall within a range not indicative of clinical depression and are moderately elevated for anxiety. Self-esteem is within the lower end of the average range (RSES score of 37, Z-score -0.17), and self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (Happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Notably, stress levels are considerably elevated (Stress score of 27, Z-score 1.47), indicating a significant perceived burden. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Health Satisfaction score of 4.67, Z-score 0.3). Their academic performance, as reflected in GPA, shows a decline in the most recent semester (2.17). Behavioral patterns reveal moderate engagement in social drinking (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a month, Z-scores 0.3 and 0.19 respectively) and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is moderately consistent, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week alone (Z-score 0.32) and less frequently with others or in sports. Daily recreation habits are characterized by significant time spent listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.6), moderate television/video consumption (31 minutes/hour, Z-score 0.64), and less engagement in activities like reading or sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, as measured by the wearable, this participant demonstrates a notably irregular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability of their heart rate is significantly low (Value 0.17, Z-score -1.98), suggesting a lack of consistent daily patterning. Conversely, Intradaily Variability is relatively high (Value 0.68, Z-score 0.95), indicating substantial fluctuations within a 24-hour period. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also low (Value 0.15, Z-score -1.45), further supporting a disorganized daily rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate) is below the population mean (Value 65.7, Z-score -1.13), and the Amplitude, representing the range of daily heart rate variation, is also suppressed (Value 6.5, Z-score -1.38). The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is recorded at 6:32 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly below average (Value 54.2, Z-score -0.47). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the Mesor, particularly during the early morning hours (2-3 AM and 3-4 AM show large positive deviations, Z-scores 2.07 and 1.60 respectively), and also during later afternoon/early evening (7-8 PM shows a notable positive deviation, Z-score 0.66). These patterns suggest a disrupted physiological rhythm that may extend into sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a below-average median sleep duration (6 hours 9 minutes, Z-score -1.29) and a relatively high variability in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation 130 minutes, Z-score 1.04), with a late median sleep start time (03:36:45). The participant also reports a substantial number of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.33, Z-score 3.05), which can disrupt nocturnal sleep patterns. The correlation analysis suggests weak or negligible relationships between most measured variables and the PSQI score. However, a positive correlation is observed between stress levels and the PSQI score (0.19), and a moderate positive correlation between high stress and CES-D scores (0.49). Conversely, there is a modest negative correlation between self-esteem and the PSQI score (-0.35), and between happiness and the PSQI score (-0.27).

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the available data, this participant likely has a PSQI score in the **top 50%** of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The reported median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes is below the population median of 6.0 hours, but the Z-score of -1.29 suggests it's not drastically low compared to others. However, the significant variability in sleep start times (Z-score 1.04) and the high frequency of napping (Z-score 3.05) are strong indicators of disrupted sleep architecture and poorer sleep regulation, which are core components of poor sleep quality. The highly irregular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by the very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.98) and low Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score -1.45), further points towards a dysregulated sleep-wake cycle. Elevated stress levels (Z-score 1.47) are also positively correlated with poorer sleep quality in general and specifically with the PSQI score in this dataset. While self-esteem and happiness are negatively correlated with the PSQI score, suggesting higher levels of these traits might be associated with better sleep, their current levels, particularly happiness, are slightly below average. The combination of a highly disrupted circadian rhythm, significant napping behavior, inconsistent sleep timing, and elevated stress levels are compelling indicators of suboptimal sleep quality that would likely place this participant in the upper half of the PSQI distribution.

37218,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and sleep metrics for a university student. The individual reports elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 49.0, Z-score 0.76), suggesting a psychological profile marked by distress. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively lower (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 29.0, Z-score -1.29), and self-reported happiness is notably low (Current Happiness score of 2.0, Z-score -1.61). Stress levels are also reported as low (Stress score of 14.0, Z-score -2.07), which may be an atypical finding given the elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms. Health satisfaction is also below average (Health Satisfaction score of 3.0, Z-score -0.95).

Behaviorally, this participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), which is a significant deviation from the study population, indicated by low Z-scores across these categories. Physical activity is also minimal, with no reported exercise alone or with others, and only occasional participation in sports (1-2 times a month). Daily recreation habits indicate substantial time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74), alongside moderate time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and using the internet (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18). Notably, reading and sedentary hobbies are not engaged in.

From wearable data, the participant exhibits moderate circadian rhythm regularity, with an Interdaily Stability value of 0.48 (Z-score 0.58) and an Intradaily Variability value of 0.55 (Z-score 0.03). The MESOR of heart rate is slightly elevated at 76.13 bpm (Z-score 0.3), while the Amplitude is below average at 8.83 bpm (Z-score -0.63), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is reported at 6:29 PM. The resting heart rate is within the population average at 61.0 bpm (Z-score 0.34).

Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of elevated heart rate in the late evening and early morning. Specifically, the hours between 9-10 PM (14.91 deviation, Z-score 1.2) and 10-11 PM (13.16 deviation, Z-score 1.06) show the largest positive deviations, indicating higher than average heart rate during these periods. Conversely, significant negative deviations, indicative of lower heart rate, are observed during the late night to early morning hours, particularly between 4-5 AM (-16.27 deviation, Z-score 0.3) and 5-6 AM (-16.98 deviation, Z-score 0.2). The hours immediately following waking, from 6-7 AM (-20.95 deviation, Z-score -0.51), also show a pronounced dip.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 1 minute, which is notably shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.45). The variability in sleep duration is also somewhat higher than average (91 minutes, Z-score -0.21). The median sleep start time is very late, at 03:56:30, with a standard deviation of 74 minutes, suggesting considerable irregularity in sleep onset. No daily naps were recorded. The strong positive correlations between CES-D and STAI scores with the PSQI score (0.49 and 0.40, respectively) suggest that higher levels of depression and anxiety are associated with poorer sleep quality. The negative correlation between self-esteem and happiness with the PSQI score (-0.35 and -0.26, respectively) further supports that lower self-worth and happiness are linked to worse sleep.

Considering the data holistically, the participant's sleep duration is significantly shorter than the population average, and their sleep onset time is considerably delayed and variable. These objective measures of sleep are further contextualized by elevated psychological distress, specifically depression and anxiety, which are known to negatively impact sleep quality. The positive correlations between these psychological factors and the PSQI score strongly suggest that this participant experiences poor sleep. While some behavioral factors like no substance use and low engagement in sedentary hobbies might be considered positive, they do not outweigh the significant deficits in sleep duration, consistency, and the presence of psychological distress. The combination of objective sleep disturbances and their association with psychological factors points towards a PSQI score likely falling into the poorer half of the distribution.

17932,13.0,0.9764397905759162,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that inform their sleep quality. Self-report data indicates a generally stable psychological state. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 12.0, Z-score of -0.14) and anxiety (STAI score of 35.0, Z-score of -0.62), classifying them as not depressed and not anxious. Self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 44.0, Z-score of 0.82), although this is within the expected range for greater self-worth. Their trust in others is notably low (Trust score of 2.67, Z-score of -1.1), suggesting a potential area of interpersonal concern. Subjective happiness is moderate (Happy score of 3.0, Z-score of -0.53), and stress levels are also moderate (Stress score of 18.0, Z-score of -0.98). Health satisfaction is relatively high (Health Satisfaction score of 5.56, Z-score of 0.97).

Behavioral habits reveal a student with moderate engagement in certain activities. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week, which are above average relative to the study population. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all. Exercise habits are robust, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more, and exercising with others and participating in sports occurring 1-2 times a week, all placing them in the higher range of frequency compared to the population. Daily recreation patterns indicate significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.64) and playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score of 2.47), the latter being particularly high. Internet usage is relatively low (16-30 minutes, Z-score of -1.16), as is listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score of -0.72). Socializing with friends is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.16), and reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are also within a moderate to low range.

Physiological data from the wearable suggests a generally regulated circadian rhythm, albeit with some notable characteristics. The participant has a low resting heart rate (48.65 bpm, Z-score of -1.13). The mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is also below average (66.57, Z-score of -1.01), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is moderate (12.61, Z-score of 0.59). The acrophase, or peak of the circadian rhythm, is around 5:12 PM. Interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly below average (0.54, Z-score of 1.08), indicating some variability in daily rhythms. Conversely, intradaily variability is low (0.37, Z-score of -1.24), suggesting a consistent pattern of heart rate fluctuation within a day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (0.52, Z-score of 1.65), further supporting a stable daily rhythm. The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM deviation of -23.03, Z-score of -1.06), followed by a marked increase in heart rate variability and elevation in the late morning and afternoon, peaking around 11 AM-12 PM and again from 4-7 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate generally good sleep duration, with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 35 minutes, significantly longer than average (Z-score of 1.74). The standard deviation of sleep duration is also relatively low (94 minutes, Z-score of -0.16), suggesting consistency. However, the median sleep start time is late at 1:23 AM, with a moderate standard deviation of 53 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep timing. The absence of naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score of -0.86) is also noteworthy.

Overall, the participant presents with a profile characterized by low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, but also low trust. They exhibit high engagement in exercise and moderate to high engagement in passive entertainment like video games and TV. Physiologically, they have a stable circadian rhythm with a low resting heart rate and a tendency towards later sleep initiation. The extended sleep duration is a positive indicator, but the late sleep start time and the presence of moderate substance use could negatively impact overall sleep quality. The correlation data suggests weak to moderate relationships between most of these variables and PSQI score. Specifically, higher stress and higher substance usage (beer, wine/liquor) have small positive correlations with PSQI, indicating a tendency towards poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction, as well as more exercise, show small negative correlations, suggesting better sleep quality. The moderate positive correlation between CES-D and PSQI (0.5) and STAI and PSQI (0.41) are the strongest positive associations observed, indicating that even mild elevations in these traits could contribute to poorer sleep. The moderate negative correlation between Self-Esteem and PSQI (-0.36) suggests higher self-esteem is associated with better sleep.

Considering the population's PSQI distribution, where the 75th percentile is 8.0 and the 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, a PSQI score above 6.0 would place a participant in the top 50% (worse sleep quality). While the participant's self-reported psychological state is largely positive, their late sleep onset, moderate substance use, and the positive correlations between stress, anxiety, and depression with PSQI suggest a potential for poorer sleep quality. The lack of strong negative indicators, coupled with the potential for negative influences, suggests their PSQI score may lean towards the higher end. However, the substantial sleep duration is a significant mitigating factor. Without the direct PSQI score, we infer based on the contributing factors and their correlations. The presence of moderate substance use and the late sleep onset, coupled with the moderate positive correlations of stress and anxiety with PSQI, are suggestive of a PSQI score that may not fall into the bottom 50% (good sleep quality).

In contrast, self-esteem is below average (RSES score of 31.0, Z=-1.01) with a negative correlation to PSQI (-0.35), suggesting higher self-esteem is associated with better sleep quality. Self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (4.0, Z=0.55) with a negative correlation to PSQI (-0.27).

Exercise frequency is high, particularly exercising alone (Three times a week or more, Z=1.07), with a slight negative correlation to PSQI (-0.09). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, each within the 16-30 minute range, with internet usage being particularly low relative to the population (Z=-1.16). Listening to music and reading also fall within the 16-30 minute range. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, which is slightly above average for this metric.

Analysis of wearable data reveals several significant findings. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.29, Z=-0.99), suggesting a less regular daily pattern of physiological activity, which correlates slightly negatively with PSQI (-0.06). Intradaily variability is also notably low (0.31, Z=-1.66), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, and this has a very weak positive correlation with PSQI (0.01). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:52 PM), which is a typical time. The mesor (average heart rate around the rhythm) is slightly elevated (78.34, Z=0.6), with a weak positive correlation to PSQI (0.06). The amplitude is below average (8.49, Z=-0.74), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate, correlating negatively with PSQI (-0.11). Resting heart rate is slightly elevated (62.6, Z=0.53) with a weak positive correlation to PSQI (0.12).

The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of significantly reduced heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, between 2 AM and 6 AM, with deviations ranging from -6.49 to -13.93. These deviations are notably higher than the population average, particularly between 3-4 AM (Z=1.23) and 4-5 AM (Z=0.79), and strongly correlate with PSQI score (e.g., 2-3 AM: 0.2, 3-4 AM: 0.22, 4-5 AM: 0.18). Conversely, heart rate deviates positively from the mesor during the late evening and early afternoon.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes (Z=0.02), which is very close to the population mean, and has a weak positive correlation with PSQI (0.05). However, the median sleep start time is notably late, at 02:40:30 AM. The standard deviation for sleep start time is 93 minutes (Z=0.22), indicating considerable variability in bedtime, with a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (0.18). Napping behavior is minimal.

The presence of elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, and lower health satisfaction, along with the highly irregular and significantly suppressed heart rate during early morning hours (which correlates with poorer sleep quality), and the late and variable sleep start times, collectively suggest a pattern indicative of poorer sleep quality. The late sleep onset time, coupled with the significant deviations in heart rate during the early morning, strongly points towards a disrupted sleep architecture. While sleep duration is average, the timing and consistency are concerning. These factors, particularly the psychological distress indicators and the sleep timing irregularities, suggest a PSQI score that is likely above the median.

67709,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their sleep quality. Self-reported data indicate a notable burden of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CES-D score of 29.0, which is significantly elevated (Z-score: 1.63) and positively correlated with PSQI scores (0.5). While the participant reports moderate chronic anxiety (STAI score: 46.0, Z-score: 0.46), their self-esteem appears relatively healthy (SelfEsteem score: 33.0, Z-score: -0.73). Stress levels are also elevated (Stress score: 26.0, Z-score: 1.19), with a moderate positive correlation to PSQI. Notably, the participant reports higher-than-average happiness (Happy score: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55), despite the high CES-D score, and a relatively neutral level of trust (Trust score: 3.17, Z-score: -0.14). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows a decline in the most recent Fall 2016 semester (2.13) compared to prior periods. Substance usage, including beer, wine, liquor, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, with significantly low Z-scores.

In terms of daily routines and habits, the participant engages in moderate exercise, participating in sports ""1-2 times a week"" and exercising with others ""Three times a week or more,"" though exercising alone is less frequent. They report spending considerable time on the internet (3-4 hours daily, Z-score: 1.52) and listening to music (2-3 hours daily, Z-score: 1.13). Conversely, activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and reading are not engaged in at all, and video game usage is also absent. Sedentary hobbies are pursued for approximately 30 minutes an hour. This profile suggests a lifestyle that includes significant digital engagement and structured physical activity with others, while neglecting other forms of leisure.

Wearable data reveals certain physiological patterns. The mesor of the participant's heart rate, representing the daily average, is slightly lower than the population mean (Value: 67.87, Z-score: -0.83), indicating a potentially lower resting cardiovascular load. The amplitude of heart rate variation is slightly above average (Value: 11.61, Z-score: 0.27). Circadian rhythm stability metrics show low interdaily stability (Value: 0.38, Z-score: -0.24) and low intradaily variability (Value: 0.46, Z-score: -0.6), suggesting a less structured and regular circadian rhythm. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value: 0.19, Z-score: -1.12), further indicating poor rhythmicity. The acrophase, the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is reported at 6:15 PM, suggesting a later evening peak. Resting heart rate is within a healthy range (Value: 53.4, Z-score: -0.56).

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns relative to the mesor. There is a marked dip in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2-3 AM and 3-4 AM (deviations of -9.26 and -15.18 respectively). A significant peak in heart rate deviation from the mesor is observed between 5-6 PM (29.45), followed by a substantial elevation in the early evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM: 19.67). Notably, heart rate then gradually decreases into the night, with a noticeable increase again in the late evening (10-11 PM: 13.37). This pattern, especially the pronounced dip in the early morning hours and the strong evening peak, may indicate significant physiological arousal or stress response occurring at these times, potentially disrupting sleep onset or maintenance.

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 16 minutes, Z-score: 1.34) and a notably higher variability in sleep duration (173 minutes, Z-score: 1.65). The median sleep start time is unusually late (3:45:29 AM), with considerable variability (98 minutes, Z-score: 0.33). The participant also takes an above-average number of naps per day (0.14, Z-score: 0.82). These findings suggest a pattern of significantly delayed and inconsistent sleep timing, alongside prolonged sleep periods with high variability, and a tendency for napping.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The available data presents a complex picture regarding the participant's sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. On the one hand, the participant reports significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D score 29.0, Z-score 1.63) and moderate stress (Stress score 26.0, Z-score 1.19), both of which have positive correlations with PSQI scores (0.5 and 0.2 respectively). These psychological factors are known to negatively impact sleep quality. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals highly irregular sleep patterns, characterized by a significantly late median sleep start time (3:45:29 AM) with substantial variability, and a high variability in total sleep duration. The presence of above-average daily naps also suggests potential sleep fragmentation or difficulty maintaining consolidated sleep. The low interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate, along with low autocorrelation at 24 hours, indicate a disorganized circadian rhythm, which is strongly linked to poor sleep quality. The substantial deviations in hourly heart rate from the mesor, particularly the pronounced dip in early morning hours and peak in the early evening, may reflect underlying physiological dysregulation that contributes to sleep disturbances.

Conversely, some metrics do not strongly point towards a poor PSQI score. The participant reports relatively healthy self-esteem (SelfEsteem score 33.0, Z-score -0.73) and a neutral level of trust. Their reported happiness, while potentially influenced by other factors, is above average. The median sleep duration is longer than average (8 hours 16 minutes), which in isolation might be considered positive, though the high variability negates this. Resting heart rate is also within a healthy range.

Considering the robust indicators of psychological distress (depression, stress), highly disrupted sleep timing and duration variability, and physiological circadian rhythm dysregulation, it is highly probable that this participant experiences poor sleep quality. The correlation coefficients, while not definitive, support the impact of depression and stress on sleep. The combined evidence strongly suggests that the participant's PSQI score would likely fall within the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality compared to the average study participant.

36552,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents a complex profile characterized by elevated anxiety and moderate levels of perceived stress, juxtaposed with high self-esteem and overall positive health satisfaction. The STAI-Trait score of 44 places them in the anxious range, while a stress score of 24, with a Z-score of 0.65, indicates a higher than average stress level within the study population. Paradoxically, their self-esteem score of 40, the maximum possible, suggests a strong sense of self-worth. Similarly, despite reporting higher stress, their happiness score (Z-score -0.53) is below the population mean, indicating a tendency towards lower self-reported happiness. This discrepancy between objective and subjective measures of well-being warrants further consideration.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a pattern of generally low substance use, with infrequent consumption of alcohol and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits are characterized by a high frequency of exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), suggesting a preference for solitary physical activity, but infrequent engagement in sports or exercising with others. Daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, each averaging around 31 minutes per hour, with less time dedicated to reading or other sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is also reported as a relatively low time commitment.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a highly variable circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high Intradaily Variability score (Z-score 1.23) and a low Interdaily Stability score (Z-score -0.99). This suggests a disrupted daily pattern in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak in heart rate rhythm, is recorded at 4:02 PM. Notably, the Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor shows pronounced peaks of physiological arousal during the late afternoon and early evening (3-4 PM: 19.92, Z-score 1.99; 7-8 PM: 1.78, Z-score -1.7, though this latter value is a strong negative deviation, suggesting lower than expected heart rate). Conversely, significant deviations indicating lower than expected heart rate are observed during the early morning hours (3-4 AM: -12.26, Z-score 0.64; 4-5 AM: -14.05, Z-score 0.67). Their resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the population mean (Z-score 0.73).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes, which is notably shorter than the population mean, and a sleep start time of 01:28:30 AM. Both sleep duration and its variability are below average for the study population (Z-scores -1.0 and -1.17 respectively), suggesting a tendency towards shorter and potentially more irregular sleep. The standard deviation for sleep start time is also lower than the population mean (Z-score -0.75), indicating a relatively consistent, albeit late, bedtime. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) suggests that sleep debt is not being directly compensated for during the day. The observed patterns of late sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, high stress, and anxiety, coupled with a disrupted circadian rhythm, are consistent with potential sleep quality concerns.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a profile that is likely to be associated with poorer sleep quality, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution. Several factors contribute to this assessment. Firstly, the wearable data indicates a significantly disrupted circadian rhythm, evidenced by high intradaily variability and low interdaily stability in heart rate. This physiological irregularity is often linked to poor sleep. Secondly, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes, which is below the population average and indicates a potential sleep deficit. The standard deviation of sleep duration also being below average may point to consistently short sleep rather than highly variable sleep, both of which can contribute to poor sleep quality.

Furthermore, the participant's self-reported psychological state is characterized by elevated anxiety (STAI score 44) and higher than average stress levels (stress score 24, Z-score 0.65). While their self-esteem is high, these factors are known to negatively impact sleep quality. The positive correlation between stress and PSQI score (0.20) and anxiety and PSQI score (0.40) further supports this. Their sleep start time is consistently late (median 01:28:30 AM), which, combined with potentially insufficient sleep duration, can lead to a feeling of insufficient rest. The lack of napping suggests these sleep deficits are not being offset during the day. While positive correlations with PSQI were not universally observed for all sleep and behavior metrics, the confluence of physiological disruption, reported sleep quantity issues, and psychological distress points towards a higher PSQI score, indicative of poorer sleep quality.

16654,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a generally healthy psychological profile, characterized by low levels of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 0.0, Z = -1.38, not depressed) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 34.0, Z = -0.72, not anxious). Their self-esteem is within the average range for the population (SelfEsteem score of 39.0, Z = 0.11). They report moderate to high happiness (Current happiness Z = -0.53) and average stress levels (Stress score of 20.0, Z = -0.44). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, appears strong and improving over the observed periods. Health satisfaction is notably high (Score = 6.0, Z = 1.3), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in regular physical activity, exercising with others more frequently than the average (Frequency 'Three times a week or more', Z = 1.23) and participating in sports and individual exercise between 1-2 times a week. Substance usage is moderate, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, while recreational and non-prescribed drugs are not used. Daily recreational habits are generally balanced, with moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, and less time spent on video games, internet usage, and sedentary hobbies. Notably, they dedicate significant time to socializing with friends (Time '2-3 hours', Z = 0.95).

Physiological data from the wearable indicates a generally stable circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population (Value = 0.54, Z = 1.08), suggesting a more regular daily pattern in cardiovascular activity. Intradaily variability is within the population average (Value = 0.58, Z = 0.24), indicating a moderate level of fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate around the rhythm) is slightly elevated (Value = 78.1, Z = 0.57), and the amplitude (range of heart rate variation) is significantly higher than the population average (Value = 15.22, Z = 1.44), implying a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 5:23 PM.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern consistent with typical diurnal rhythms. The most pronounced negative deviations, indicating lower heart rates than the mesor, occur during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -20.53, 4-5 AM: -23.72, 5-6 AM: -24.62). Conversely, positive deviations, indicating higher heart rates, are observed in the afternoon and evening, particularly between 1-2 PM (18.77) and 5-6 PM (16.69). This pattern suggests a period of physiological rest and lower arousal during the night and a transition to higher arousal during the day and early evening. The resting heart rate is within the average range (Value = 59.7, Z = 0.18).

Sleep statistics indicate a relatively good sleep duration, with a median of 7 hours and 46 minutes, which is longer than the population median (Z = 0.73). The variability in sleep duration is lower than average (Value = '55 minutes', Z = -1.04), suggesting more consistent nightly sleep length. The sleep start time, however, is considerably later than the population average, with a median start time of 01:37:45 AM. The variability in sleep start time is also lower than average (Value = '30 minutes', Z = -1.17), indicating a consistent, albeit late, sleep onset. No daily naps were recorded (Value = 0.0, Z = -0.86), further supporting a consistent nocturnal sleep pattern.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The provided data suggests that this participant likely falls within the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several factors support this conclusion:

Firstly, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, both of which are commonly associated with poorer sleep quality. Their self-esteem is within the average range, and they report moderate to high happiness and average stress levels, indicating a generally stable psychological state that does not suggest significant sleep disturbance.

Secondly, their lifestyle behaviors do not indicate significant risk factors for poor sleep. They engage in regular exercise, maintain moderate substance usage, and exhibit a balanced approach to daily recreational activities, with substantial time dedicated to social interaction.

Thirdly, the wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm with good interdaily stability, suggesting a predictable daily pattern in physiological activity. While the amplitude of their heart rate variation is higher than average, this can be indicative of a more dynamic physiological response rather than necessarily poor sleep. The aggregated hourly heart rate data suggests a clear diurnal pattern of lower heart rate during the night and higher heart rate during the day and early evening, consistent with healthy sleep-wake cycles.

Crucially, the sleep statistics from the wearable device indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 46 minutes, which is longer than the population median and falls within generally recommended sleep ranges. Furthermore, the low standard deviation in sleep duration and sleep start time points to a consistent sleep schedule, even if the onset is late. A consistent sleep schedule, even if late, is generally associated with better sleep quality than erratic sleep patterns. The absence of daily naps also supports a consolidated nocturnal sleep period.

While the PSQI score itself is not directly provided, the confluence of positive psychological indicators, healthy lifestyle habits, evidence of a stable circadian rhythm, and particularly the objectively measured consistent and sufficient sleep duration strongly suggests that this participant experiences good to average sleep quality. This would place them in the lower half of the PSQI distribution, where lower scores indicate better sleep.

This participant exhibits a mixed profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns, with certain aspects potentially influencing sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological state, with a CES-D score suggesting no significant depressive symptoms (Z-score: -0.14) and an STAI-Trait score classifying them as not chronically anxious (Z-score: -0.33). Self-esteem appears to be within a normal range (Z-score: 0.11), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.55). Trust in others is notably high (Z-score: 0.83), and health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z-score: 0.55).

Behavioral habits present a more complex picture. This participant engages in moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, which are above average for these categories (Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while reporting no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity levels are mixed; they exercise alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32) but demonstrate a strong tendency to exercise with others and participate in sports, with frequencies of ""three times a week or more"" (Z-scores: 1.23 and 1.58 respectively), suggesting a social and structured approach to exercise. Daily recreation includes moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and reading (Z-scores: 0.01, 0.18, and 1.3 respectively), with significantly less time spent on video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, and sedentary hobbies. The time spent socializing with friends is notably low (Z-score: -0.62).

Physiological data derived from the wearable reveals a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.33) and a mesor (average 24-hour heart rate) that is also below the population average (Z-score: -0.56). The amplitude of heart rate variation is also somewhat reduced (Z-score: -0.51), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, is reported as 5:06 PM, which is within a typical diurnal range. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.0) and intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.18), indicating a generally regular daily pattern in heart rate, though not exceptionally so.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct diurnal patterns. Heart rates tend to be lower than the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, with the most significant deviations occurring between 3 AM and 5 AM (Z-scores ranging from 0.17 to 0.59). As the day progresses, heart rates deviate positively from the mesor, peaking between 11 AM and 1 PM (Z-scores up to 1.25), and again in the evening between 7 PM and 8 PM (Z-score: 0.57). This pattern is consistent with typical activity cycles, with lower heart rates during presumed sleep and higher rates during waking hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 40 minutes, which is longer than average for the population (Z-score: 0.6). However, the variability in sleep duration is high, with a standard deviation of 159 minutes (Z-score: 1.33), suggesting inconsistency in sleep duration from night to night. The median sleep start time is late, at 1:13 AM, and the standard deviation of sleep start times is also notably high (2.2), indicating significant irregularity in bedtime. The average daily naps are also higher than the population average (Z-score: 0.61).

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score needs to be evaluated in the context of the provided population statistics and the correlations observed between various metrics and PSQI. The population mean PSQI is 6.71, with a median of 6.0. The 75th percentile is 8.0, meaning scores above 8.0 are in the top 25% of the population, and scores above 6.0 are in the top 50% (indicating poorer sleep quality).

Several factors suggest a potentially higher PSQI score (poorer sleep quality) for this participant. The significant variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 1.33) and, more critically, the highly irregular sleep start times (Z-score: 2.2) are strong indicators of poor sleep hygiene and likely contribute to a higher PSQI score. The median sleep duration of 7 hours 40 minutes is good, but the inconsistency is a significant concern. Furthermore, the participant's late median sleep start time of 1:13 AM, coupled with high variability, aligns with a less structured sleep schedule. The moderate positive correlation between Mean Daily Naps (Z-score: 0.61) and PSQI (0.17) also suggests that increased napping might be associated with poorer overall sleep.

Conversely, some factors might point towards a more favorable sleep profile. The participant's generally good psychological well-being (low CES-D and STAI scores) and relatively high self-esteem and happiness could mitigate sleep disturbances. The physical activity levels, particularly exercising with others and participating in sports, are high and generally correlate negatively with PSQI, which is beneficial. The resting heart rate and mesor are below average, which can be indicative of good cardiovascular health and potentially better sleep regulation, although the correlation with PSQI for these metrics is not strongly positive. The negative correlation between Self-Esteem and PSQI (-0.36) and Health Satisfaction and PSQI (-0.22) are positive indicators.

However, the data strongly emphasizes the impact of sleep schedule irregularity. The high standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score: 2.2) is a substantial red flag and a primary driver of poor sleep quality according to PSQI. While other factors are more positive, the pronounced irregularity in sleep timing is a more potent predictor of poor subjective sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Given that the population median is 6.0 and the 75th percentile is 8.0, and considering the significant sleep schedule variability, it is plausible that this participant's PSQI score falls into the upper half of the distribution.

24029,6.0,0.387434554973822,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that warrant thorough consideration in relation to their sleep quality. Notably, elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 21.0, Z=0.8) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 50.0, Z=0.86) are observed. These findings are corroborated by a relatively lower self-esteem score (RSES score of 29.0, Z=-1.29). The participant reports moderate levels of trust (Z=0.5) and happiness (Z=0.55), alongside significantly high stress levels (score of 30.0, Z=2.28). Physical health satisfaction is within the average range for the study population (Z=-0.45).

Regarding behavioral habits, this participant reports no substance usage across beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Conversely, they engage in frequent exercise, reporting participation in ""Three times a week or more"" for exercising alone, with others, and in sports, with Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively. Daily recreational activities show a pronounced engagement in video gaming (1-2 hours, Z=2.47) and listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z=2.06). They also report spending 2-3 hours on sedentary hobbies (Z=2.01) and 1-2 hours watching TV/videos/movies (Z=1.28). Internet usage and socializing with friends fall within more moderate ranges (Z=-0.49 and Z=-0.62 respectively), while reading is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z=0.32). The participant's BMI is within the healthy range at 19.93.

Physiological and sleep data reveal several key characteristics. The participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by an interdaily stability of 0.42 (Z=0.09), though intradaily variability is slightly elevated at 0.7 (Z=1.09). The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below population average (Z=-0.15), and amplitude is slightly above (Z=0.23). The acrophase occurs in the early afternoon (2:19 PM). The resting heart rate is below average for the study population (54.6, Z=-0.42). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights distinct patterns. The participant experiences significant dips in heart rate deviation during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.28 to -2.94), indicating periods of low physiological arousal. Conversely, marked increases in heart rate deviation are observed from approximately 6 AM onwards, peaking between 6-8 AM (Z=4.77 and Z=2.66 respectively), suggesting a typical diurnal pattern of increasing arousal towards the morning. A moderate increase in heart rate deviation is also observed in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 3-7 PM).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is below the population median and associated with a negative Z-score (-0.52). The standard deviation of sleep duration is close to the population mean (102 minutes, Z=0.02). The median sleep start time is approximately 10:45 PM, with a standard deviation of 99 minutes, which is slightly higher than the population average (Z=0.36). The participant reports no daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z=-0.86).

In assessing the participant's PSQI score in relation to the study population, several factors suggest a higher likelihood of poor sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes falls below the 50th percentile of the population's PSQI data (which has a 50th percentile of 6.0 for the PSQI score, implying average sleep quality). Furthermore, the elevated levels of psychological distress, specifically depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 21.0, Z=0.8) and anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z=0.86), are strongly correlated with poorer sleep quality. While the participant engages in frequent exercise, which is generally beneficial for sleep, the significant time spent on video games and extensive music listening may represent displacement of sleep time or activities that could negatively impact sleep. The elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (Z=1.09) could also reflect fragmented sleep or disturbed physiological regulation during the day. The relatively low resting heart rate, while generally a sign of good cardiovascular fitness, does not strongly indicate sleep quality in isolation. The correlations provided, although not the sole basis for interpretation, show a positive correlation between CES-D and STAI scores with PSQI, and negative correlations with Self-Esteem, Trust, Happy, and Health Satisfaction. The strongest positive correlation with PSQI is with the CES-D score (0.5), suggesting that higher depressive symptom burden is associated with worse sleep quality. Given these converging indicators of psychological distress and sleep duration, it is likely that this participant falls into the top 50% of the distribution for PSQI scores, indicating poorer sleep quality.

Self-esteem is also within the average range, with a score of 40.0 (Z-score 0.26), aligning with the maximum possible score for the measure. Trust in others is notably low (Z-score -1.1), indicating a potential hesitancy in interpersonal relationships.

The participant's BMI is within the healthy range at 21.7, and they report average satisfaction with their physical health (Score 5.0, Z-score 0.55).

Behavioral patterns indicate consistent engagement in physical activity, with exercising alone reported three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), while exercising with others occurs less frequently (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53). Sports engagement is minimal (1-2 times a month, Z-score 0.25). Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs), with significantly below-average Z-scores across all these items. Daily recreational habits show a preference for moderate engagement in video games (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.2) and a relatively low engagement in internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.16). Listening to music and reading are engaged in for similar durations (16-30 minutes), with reading showing a stronger positive correlation with a higher Z-score. Socializing with friends is reported for 31 minutes to an hour, and sedentary hobbies are also engaged in for 16-30 minutes.

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by a moderate interdaily stability of 0.59 (Z-score 1.49), suggesting a degree of regularity in daily activity patterns. However, intradaily variability is relatively low (0.37, Z-score -1.24), implying less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which might be indicative of a less dynamic physiological response. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population average (67.79, Z-score -0.84), and the resting heart rate is also notably low (49.8, Z-score -0.99). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is relatively high (13.48, Z-score 0.87), suggesting a pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 4:28 PM, aligning with typical daytime activity.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern: significant negative deviations occur during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, -24.54, Z-score -1.3; 4-5 AM, -28.41, Z-score -1.71; 5-6 AM, -27.17, Z-score -1.28; 6-7 AM, -25.91, Z-score -1.19). This suggests a period of physiological inactivity or reduced arousal during these times. Conversely, positive deviations are observed in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM-12 PM, 14.66, Z-score 1.36; 12-1 PM, 15.45, Z-score 1.07; 1-2 PM, 16.9, Z-score 1.48; 2-3 PM, 14.14, Z-score 1.31; 4-5 PM, 16.03, Z-score 1.07), indicating periods of higher physiological arousal consistent with daytime activities.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.31). The variability in sleep duration is relatively low (61 minutes, Z-score -0.91). The median sleep start time is approximately 00:57, with moderate variability (73 minutes, Z-score -0.21). No daily naps were recorded (Z-score -0.86). The correlations between these metrics and PSQI score are generally low, with some minor positive correlations for sleep duration standard deviation (0.19) and mean daily naps (0.17), and minor negative correlations for median sleep duration (-0.05) and sleep start time standard deviation (-0.18).

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's likely PSQI group, we consider the available data in relation to the population distribution for the PSQI. The population mean PSQI score is 6.73, with a 50th percentile of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0.

The participant exhibits several characteristics that might suggest a PSQI score in the bottom 50th percentile (indicating relatively good or average sleep quality). Their low levels of depression and anxiety, coupled with average self-esteem, are generally associated with better sleep. The consistent engagement in exercise, though primarily solitary, is also a positive factor for sleep quality. Furthermore, the absence of substance usage and a BMI within the healthy range contribute to a profile generally conducive to good sleep. The wearable data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm, which is crucial for healthy sleep patterns, and the identified period of low physiological arousal during the night is consistent with sleep.

Conversely, evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile, indicating relatively poor sleep quality) is less prominent. While the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes is slightly below the population mean, it is not drastically so, and the low variability suggests consistency. The sleep start time is late, but the variability is moderate. The moderate positive correlation between sleep duration standard deviation and PSQI score (0.19) is weak, and the positive correlation for mean daily naps (0.17) is also small.

Considering the overall picture, the psychological profile is largely favorable for good sleep. The behavioral patterns, particularly the absence of substance use and consistent exercise, are supportive of healthy sleep. The circadian rhythm metrics and the temporal pattern of heart rate deviation suggest a physiologically regulated sleep-wake cycle, with a clear period of reduced activity overnight. While the sleep duration is slightly below average, it is not indicative of a severe deficit, especially when balanced against the other positive indicators. Therefore, the weight of the evidence suggests that this participant is more likely to fall within the bottom 50th percentile of the PSQI distribution.

49086,6.0,0.387434554973822,"This participant exhibits a predominantly healthy psychological and lifestyle profile, which generally correlates with better sleep quality. Their scores on the CES-D and STAI indicate low levels of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively. Self-esteem is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.1, suggesting a strong sense of self-worth. Trust in others and overall happiness are also within the average range, with happiness showing a slight negative correlation with sleep quality. Health satisfaction is moderate, and the participant reports a healthy Body Mass Index of 20.67.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drug use. Notably, there is a significant lack of engagement in any form of exercise, including solitary activities, exercising with others, and sports, reflected in very low Z-scores for these metrics. Daily recreational habits are characterized by moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, and socializing with friends, alongside more limited time spent on video games, internet usage, reading, and sedentary hobbies. The low Z-score for exercising alone (-1.93) and with others (-1.58) suggests a significant deviation from the population average, implying a predominantly sedentary lifestyle outside of structured activities.

The wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by interdaily stability (0.39) and intradaily variability (0.52) that are close to the population mean. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is recorded at 5:43 PM, which is within a typical diurnal range. The mesor (average heart rate) and amplitude (variation around the mesor) are also within average ranges, with the mesor showing a Z-score of -0.61 and amplitude -0.57, suggesting slightly lower than average resting heart rate parameters. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of higher physiological arousal in the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am, 1-2 am, 2-3 am, 3-4 am, 4-5 am, 5-6 am show positive deviations, with the highest positive deviation at 12-1am showing a Z-score of 1.66). This pattern of elevated heart rate during the typical sleep window could indicate difficulties in physiological relaxation conducive to sleep.

In terms of sleep statistics, the median sleep duration is 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above average and correlates negatively with sleep quality. The standard deviation for sleep duration is moderate, suggesting some variability. The median sleep start time is quite late, at 2:19 AM, with a standard deviation of 78 minutes, indicating a highly irregular sleep schedule. This late and variable sleep onset time is a significant factor likely contributing to poorer sleep quality, as evidenced by the positive correlation with PSQI score. The absence of daily naps further supports a continuous, albeit delayed, sleep pattern.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant exhibits several indicators that may suggest poorer sleep quality, potentially placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population for PSQI scores. The most significant contributing factor is the highly irregular and late sleep start time (median 2:19 AM, with considerable variability), which is known to negatively impact subjective sleep quality. While the total sleep duration is adequate, the timing and consistency of sleep are crucial. Furthermore, the elevated heart rate deviations during the early morning hours (12 AM - 6 AM), particularly the high Z-score of 1.66 between 12-1 AM, suggest physiological arousal that could interfere with sleep consolidation and quality. The moderate happiness scores and the positive correlation between happiness and PSQI score might also suggest that individuals who report being less happy tend to have better sleep quality, implying this participant's average happiness could be associated with slightly poorer sleep.

Conversely, the participant's low levels of depression and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem, are generally protective factors for good sleep. Their healthy BMI and moderate health satisfaction also contribute positively. The moderate sleep duration itself, while not indicative of exceptionally good sleep, is not a strong indicator of poor sleep. The lack of exercise, while a lifestyle concern, does not directly and strongly correlate with PSQI score in this data.

Considering the significant irregularity in sleep timing and the physiological arousal patterns during the night, the negative influences on sleep quality appear to outweigh the positive psychological factors. Therefore, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the upper half of the distribution, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality.

95490,6.0,0.387434554973822,"This participant exhibits a mixed profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with some indicators pointing towards potential sleep quality challenges. In terms of self-reported psychological traits, the participant reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 14.0, Z-score 0.07), not meeting criteria for clinical depression, and a moderate level of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 47.0, Z-score 0.56), placing them in the upper half of the population for trait anxiety. Self-esteem is within the average range (Self-Esteem score of 34.0, Z-Score -0.59), and while overall happiness is slightly below average (Happy score of 3.0, Z-Score -0.53), health satisfaction is also slightly lower than average (Health Satisfaction score of 3.89, Z-score -0.28). Stress levels are moderately elevated (Stress score of 23.0, Z-score 0.38). Trust in others is also slightly below average (Trust score of 3.5, Z-Score 0.5). Academically, the participant demonstrates an improving GPA trend across semesters.

Behaviorally, this participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity includes exercising alone three times a week or more, which is above average, but less frequent exercise with others or participation in sports. Daily recreational habits show significant time spent listening to music and socializing with friends, as well as moderate time spent watching TV/videos and moderate internet usage. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in video games or reading.

From the wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics indicate a moderately stable daily pattern in heart rate (Interdaily Stability Value 0.23, Z-Score -1.48), suggesting some regularity, but also a slightly higher than average variability within the day (Intradaily Variability Value 0.6, Z-Score 0.39). The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly elevated (Mesor Value 77.1, Z-Score 0.43), and the resting heart rate is also slightly elevated (Resting Heart Rate Value 61.4, Z-Score 0.39). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Amplitude Value 8.34, Z-Score -0.79), which can sometimes be associated with less robust daily physiological fluctuations. The acrophase, representing the peak time of heart rate, is reported at 4:25 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of significant deviation during the late afternoon and early evening (4-6 PM), potentially reflecting heightened physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, a notable dip in heart rate deviation occurs in the early morning hours (2-6 AM).

Regarding sleep statistics, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, which is slightly below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is within the population range, indicating some consistency in duration. The median sleep start time is quite late, at approximately 1:11 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time, suggesting variability in bedtime. The participant also reports infrequent napping.

The correlation data indicates a positive correlation between stress levels and PSQI score, and between depressive symptoms and PSQI score, suggesting these psychological factors may contribute to poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem and happiness show a negative correlation with PSQI score, indicating they are associated with better sleep quality.

Considering the aggregated evidence, the participant's sleep duration is slightly below average. The late sleep start time and its variability, coupled with moderate stress and anxiety levels, suggest potential factors contributing to suboptimal sleep quality. While not definitively indicative of poor sleep, these elements lean towards the upper half of the PSQI distribution.

90079,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators that may influence sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a psychological profile characterized by not being depressed (CES-D score of 14, Z-score 0.07), not being chronically anxious (STAI score of 38, Z-score -0.33), and possessing moderate self-esteem (Self-Esteem score of 34, Z-score -0.59). Furthermore, their reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53), and they report moderate levels of stress (Stress score of 24, Z-score 0.65). Trust in others is notably low (Trust score of 2.5, Z-score -1.42), and health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Health Satisfaction score of 4.0, Z-score -0.2). Academically, the participant's GPA has shown a slight upward trend across semesters, ranging from 3.13 to 3.4.

Behaviorally, the participant reports abstaining from all forms of substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits involve exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, with sports participation being less frequent (less than 1-2 times a month). Daily recreation primarily involves moderate internet usage (1-2 hours) and listening to music (1-2 hours), with a slight tendency towards sedentary hobbies (16-30 minutes). Notably, they report not engaging in watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games, and also do not engage in reading for leisure.

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits a disrupted circadian rhythm, as indicated by a low Interdaily Stability (0.21, Z-score -1.65) and high Intradaily Variability (0.75, Z-score 1.44) in heart rate. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (0.14, Z-score -1.54), further supporting a lack of regularity. The Mesor (76.93, Z-score 0.41) is slightly elevated, and the Amplitude (6.53, Z-score -1.37) is somewhat reduced. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (4:54 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (65.6, Z-score 0.89). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, -11.27 deviation; 3-4 AM, -12.71 deviation; 4-5 AM, -11.69 deviation), which is indicative of sleep. Heart rates tend to rise throughout the morning and into the afternoon, with the highest positive deviations observed in the early afternoon (e.g., 1-2 PM, 6.96 deviation).

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a consistently short sleep duration, with a median of 5 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score -1.59). While the variability in sleep duration is slightly above average (138 minutes, Z-score 0.84), the median sleep start time is very late, around 1:53 AM. The standard deviation of sleep start time is also moderately elevated (104 minutes, Z-score 0.46), suggesting some variability in bedtime. Napping behavior is minimal.

The PSQI population data indicates a mean score of 6.72, with a standard deviation of 2.16. The 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. A PSQI score of 6.0 or lower is considered good sleep quality, while scores above 6.0 suggest poorer sleep quality.

Considering the participant's data, several factors point towards poorer sleep quality. The significantly short median sleep duration (5 hours 54 minutes) is a strong indicator of insufficient sleep, and its low Z-score of -1.59 places it in the bottom quartile of the study population. The late median sleep start time (01:53:44) and the higher variability in sleep start times also suggest irregular sleep patterns. The wearable circadian rhythm metrics, particularly the low Interdaily Stability and high Intradaily Variability, indicate a lack of consistent daily physiological rhythm, which is strongly associated with poor sleep quality. While the participant reports no significant depression or anxiety, their slightly lower happiness and health satisfaction, along with very low trust, could indirectly impact their sleep. The moderate stress levels, while not extremely high, can also contribute to sleep disturbances. The correlation analyses provided offer additional context: for example, median sleep duration has a correlation of 0.05 with PSQI, and sleep duration standard deviation has a correlation of 0.2, suggesting a slight positive association with poorer sleep quality. Intradaily variability has a correlation of 0.01, which is negligible, while interdaily stability has a correlation of -0.07, suggesting a slight negative association with PSQI, meaning higher stability might be linked to better sleep.

Given the markedly short sleep duration, irregular sleep schedule, and disrupted circadian rhythm metrics, it is highly probable that this participant's overall PSQI score falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality.

22842,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that likely influence their sleep quality. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z=0.7) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 46.0, Z=0.46), which are positively correlated with their PSQI score, suggesting these psychological states may contribute to poorer sleep. Conversely, self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES score of 36.0, Z=-0.31), and trust in others is also slightly lower (Trust score of 3.33, Z=0.18), with negative correlations to PSQI, hinting that higher self-esteem and trust might be associated with better sleep. Happiness levels are notably low (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z=-0.53), and this is also negatively correlated with PSQI. Stress levels are slightly elevated (Stress score of 22.0, Z=0.1), with a positive correlation to PSQI, indicating that higher stress may disrupt sleep. Physical health satisfaction is considerably low (Health Satisfaction score of 5.44, Z=0.88), suggesting potential somatic contributions to sleep disturbances.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate exercise, specifically working out alone three times a week or more (Exercised Alone frequency Z=1.07), while other forms of exercise and sports are less frequent. Notably, video game usage is significantly high (Video Games time Z=1.71), exceeding typical patterns in the study population. While internet usage and socializing with friends are within average ranges, time spent watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are relatively low. Substance usage for alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drugs is minimal, with Z-scores indicating usage below the population average.

Physiologically, as measured by their Fitbit, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (54.2 bpm, Z=-0.47), which is negatively correlated with their PSQI score. The cosinor analysis of their heart rate data reveals a mesor of 69.34 bpm (Z=-0.63) and an amplitude of 8.7 (Z=-0.67), both indicating lower than average physiological activity levels within their circadian rhythm. The acrophase, representing the peak of their heart rate rhythm, occurs at 6:03 PM. Measures of circadian rhythm regularity are suboptimal, with low interdaily stability (0.3, Z=-0.9) and lower than average intradaily variability (0.46, Z=-0.6). This suggests a less robust and structured daily physiological rhythm. The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals pronounced deviations during the late night and early morning hours. Specifically, heart rates are significantly elevated above the mesor between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM, with increasingly negative deviations from 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM, indicating a pattern of physiological arousal during typical sleep onset and early sleep stages, followed by a significant dip in heart rate as morning approaches. Heart rate then progressively increases throughout the morning and afternoon, peaking in the late afternoon/early evening, aligning with the observed acrophase.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a generally adequate median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes (Z=0.83), which is above average for the population. However, the variability in sleep duration is also higher than average (Standard Deviation of 133 minutes, Z=0.73). A significant finding is the exceptionally late and highly variable median sleep start time of 02:56:32, with a substantial standard deviation of 164 minutes (Z=1.79). This indicates significant difficulty in initiating sleep at a consistent or early time. Furthermore, the participant reports a high frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps of 0.28, Z=2.4), suggesting a compensatory behavior for perceived insufficient or poor-quality nighttime sleep. These factors, particularly the highly disrupted sleep onset timing and frequent napping, are likely strong contributors to overall sleep quality as measured by the PSQI.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding sleep quality. On one hand, their median sleep duration is adequate, and their resting heart rate is low. However, several indicators strongly suggest compromised sleep quality, which would likely place them in the upper half of the PSQI distribution, signifying poorer sleep. The elevated CES-D and STAI scores, coupled with low happiness and stress, are positively correlated with PSQI, indicating a psychological burden impacting sleep. The exceptionally late and variable sleep start times, along with frequent napping, are direct indicators of sleep disturbance and likely contribute significantly to a high PSQI score. The physiological data, showing marked heart rate dysregulation during typical sleep periods and low circadian rhythm stability, further supports the notion of poor sleep architecture. While the exact PSQI score is not provided, the confluence of these psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors points towards a sleep quality that is likely worse than the median of the study population. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that this participant would fall into the top 50% of the PSQI distribution, representing poorer sleep quality.

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally low psychological distress and moderate engagement in social and physical activities. Their scores on the CES-D and STAI scales indicate minimal depressive symptoms and a low level of chronic anxiety, respectively. Self-esteem is within the typical range, with a score at the upper end of the scale. Trust in others is notably low, as indicated by a Z-score of -1.74. Self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53), and stress levels are moderate. The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19.84 falls within the healthy range.

Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports infrequent alcohol consumption (beer: less than 1-2 times a month; wine or liquor: 1-2 times a week) and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are mixed; while exercising alone is infrequent (1-2 times a month), exercising with others and participating in sports occur with moderate frequency (1-2 times a week). Daily recreational habits indicate low engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with significantly less time spent on these compared to the population average (indicated by negative Z-scores for time spent, except for video games). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in listening to music or reading, and does not engage in sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, which is slightly above the population average.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.48) and intradaily variability (0.62) suggest a moderate degree of regularity in daily heart rate patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.42) further supports this, indicating a moderate tendency for heart rate patterns to repeat on a daily basis. The mesor (76.93 bpm) and resting heart rate (59.0 bpm) are within typical ranges, with the mesor being slightly above average and the resting heart rate slightly below average compared to the study population. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm (14.2 bpm) is relatively high, suggesting a significant fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. During nighttime hours (approximately 12 AM to 6 AM), heart rates are consistently below the mesor, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM, suggesting periods of physiological rest. As the day progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, indicating increased physiological arousal. Peak positive deviations are observed in the late afternoon and early evening, particularly between 12 PM-1 PM, 3 PM-4 PM, and 6 PM-7 PM. This pattern is consistent with typical daily activity cycles. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is recorded at 4:05 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally positive sleep profile. The median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes is above average for the study population (Z-score of 1.24). The variability in sleep duration is also within a reasonable range (93 minutes standard deviation). The median sleep start time of approximately midnight (00:17:58) is consistent with a typical sleep schedule, and the standard deviation for sleep start time (66 minutes) suggests moderate regularity in bedtime. Napping behavior is minimal.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators that may influence their PSQI score, reflecting both potential strengths and weaknesses in sleep quality. On the positive side, the self-report measures indicate generally low levels of distress, with low scores on the CES-D and STAI, and a healthy level of self-esteem. Low stress and high health satisfaction are also associated with better sleep. Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with moderate interdaily stability and intradaily variability. The median sleep duration of over 8 hours is a strong indicator of sufficient sleep quantity.

Conversely, several factors could potentially contribute to a less favorable PSQI score. The low trust score, while not directly measured by the PSQI, might be associated with underlying psychological states that can impact sleep. The lack of engagement in activities like reading or listening to music, and the low usage of sedentary hobbies, might suggest a lack of restorative or wind-down routines before sleep. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high, which, depending on the nature of these fluctuations, could be indicative of more pronounced periods of wakefulness or physiological activation during the night, though the aggregated data does not explicitly detail this.

Considering the PSQI population statistics, the mean PSQI score is 6.72 with a standard deviation of 2.16, placing the 50th percentile at 6.0 and the 75th percentile at 8.0. A PSQI score above 6 typically indicates poor sleep quality.

The participant's long sleep duration and relatively stable sleep start times are strong positive indicators for good sleep quality. The absence of significant psychological distress (low depression and anxiety) also strongly supports better sleep. While the low trust score and specific activity patterns are noted, they have relatively weak or non-significant correlations with PSQI score in the provided data. The high amplitude in heart rate variability is a point of interest, but without more detailed sleep stage data, its direct impact on PSQI is speculative. Given the strong positive indicators of sufficient sleep duration and general psychological well-being, and the lack of strong negative correlations with PSQI, it is plausible that the participant falls into the lower half of the PSQI distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality.

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and physiological characteristics, which may influence their sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. Notably, the participant reports elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.05) and anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.65), which are positively correlated with their PSQI score, suggesting a potential contribution to poorer sleep. Concurrently, their self-esteem is relatively low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score = -1.71), and they report lower levels of happiness (Current Happiness Z-score = -1.61), with both inversely correlated with PSQI. Trust in others is also higher than the population average (Trust Z-score = 1.47), though with a weak negative correlation to PSQI. Stress levels are slightly above average (Stress Z-score = 0.65) and show a weak positive correlation with PSQI. Physical health satisfaction is notably low (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -1.86), with a negative correlation to PSQI, indicating that dissatisfaction with physical health may be associated with better sleep quality, or vice versa.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with regular consumption of beer and wine/liquor (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise is undertaken with moderate frequency, both alone and with others, and participation in sports is also at a similar frequency. Daily recreational habits indicate a preference for listening to music for extended periods (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13), moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score = 0.18), and less frequent engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV, playing video games, or reading. Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = -0.62), and sedentary hobbies are not pursued.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a generally stable circadian rhythm, indicated by an Interdaily Stability of 0.49 (Z-score = 0.67) and an Intradaily Variability of 0.69 (Z-score = 1.02), though the latter suggests a degree of daily fluctuation. The mesor (average heart rate rhythm) is slightly above the population mean (Mesor Z-score = 0.38), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also elevated (Amplitude Z-score = 1.04), suggesting a more pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs in the late afternoon (5:17 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = 0.24). Analysis of the Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor indicates typical patterns of lower heart rate in the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM deviation of -16.62, Z-score = -0.56), with a notable peak in heart rate deviation during the evening hours, particularly between 6-7 PM (deviation of 22.95, Z-score = 1.81) and 7-8 PM (deviation of 24.36, Z-score = 2.24), followed by a gradual decrease. This evening elevation in heart rate, coinciding with the reported acrophase of the circadian rhythm, may reflect increased physiological arousal or activity prior to sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score = 0.54), which is longer than the population average. The standard deviation for sleep duration is relatively low (88 minutes, Z-score = -0.29), suggesting consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around 00:54:00, which is later than typical, with a moderate standard deviation for sleep start time (68 minutes, Z-score = -0.33), indicating some variability in bedtime. The participant averages a small number of daily naps (0.12, Z-score = 0.61). The positive correlation between median sleep duration and PSQI score (0.05) suggests that longer sleep duration is weakly associated with poorer sleep quality in this participant. Conversely, the standard deviation of sleep duration shows a positive correlation (0.2), suggesting that greater variability in sleep duration is associated with poorer sleep quality. The PSQI correlation for sleep start time standard deviation is 0.18, implying greater variability in bedtime is also associated with poorer sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's PSQI score appears to be in the upper half of the study population, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality. This conclusion is supported by several factors. Firstly, the participant reports significant levels of depression (CES-D Z-score = 2.05) and anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.65), both of which are positively correlated with their PSQI score. Elevated psychological distress is a well-established contributor to poor sleep. Secondly, while the participant's median sleep duration is longer than average (7 hours 37 minutes), the standard deviation for sleep duration (88 minutes) and sleep start time (68 minutes) are also relatively high, and these metrics show positive correlations with the PSQI score, suggesting that variability in sleep patterns may negatively impact sleep quality. The late median sleep start time (00:54) also suggests potential sleep timing issues.

Although the participant exhibits a stable circadian rhythm in terms of interdaily stability, the elevated amplitude of their heart rate rhythm and the significant increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the evening hours (peaking between 7-8 PM) could indicate a heightened state of physiological arousal that interferes with sleep onset or maintenance. Furthermore, while not directly quantified as a PSQI score, the presence of significant depressive and anxious symptomatology, coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, are all commonly associated with impaired sleep quality. The weak negative correlations of self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction with PSQI suggest that lower levels in these areas are associated with higher (worse) PSQI scores. Considering the aggregate of these indicators—elevated psychological distress, increased variability in sleep timing and duration, and potential evening arousal—it is likely that this participant's PSQI score falls within the top 50% of the study population, signifying poorer sleep quality.

52302,6.0,0.387434554973822,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that likely influence their sleep quality. Psychologically, they report moderate levels of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17) and relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Score: 39.0, Z-score: 0.11), with their self-reported happiness and trust in others falling slightly above the study average (Happy Z-score: 0.55, Trust Z-score: 0.5). Depressive symptoms are not indicated (CESD Z-score: -0.66). Their academic performance, as reflected in their GPA, shows a slight decline across semesters, from 3.78 in Fall 2015 to 3.24 in Fall 2016. Behaviorally, this participant reports abstaining from all forms of substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, and engages in moderate exercise, specifically ""1-2 times a week"" for exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports. However, their daily recreational habits indicate a significant amount of sedentary screen time, with substantial hours spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours) and using the internet (2-3 hours), and notably high engagement in video games (31 minutes an hour) and socializing with friends (3-4 hours). Reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are minimal.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (52.5 bpm, Z-score: -0.67), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Their circadian rhythm is characterized by a mesor of 71.88 bpm (Z-score: -0.28) and an amplitude of 12.34 bpm (Z-score: 0.5), with the acrophase (peak heart rate) occurring in the late afternoon at 5:17 PM. The interdaily stability of their heart rate is notably low (0.37, Z-score: -0.33), suggesting a lack of regularity in their daily physiological rhythms. Conversely, intradaily variability is also low (0.41, Z-score: -0.95), which could indicate less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score: 1.14), with a moderate standard deviation in duration (123 minutes, Z-score: 0.51). However, their sleep start time is consistently late, with a median of 01:07:59 and a standard deviation of 103 minutes, suggesting irregular sleep timing. The participant also reports a low frequency of napping (0.13, Z-score: 0.7).

The participant's sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, appears to be in the lower half of the distribution. While they report a healthy sleep duration, their sleep start time is significantly delayed and variable, a common indicator of poor sleep hygiene. The low interdaily stability in their heart rate further suggests a lack of consistent daily rhythm, which can negatively impact sleep. Although direct PSQI scores are not provided, the observed patterns, such as late and irregular sleep onset, coupled with high sedentary recreational screen time, are typically associated with poorer sleep quality. The correlations provided, though not definitive on their own, show weak or non-significant relationships between most of these metrics and PSQI score. However, the positive correlation between sleep duration standard deviation and PSQI (0.2) and the weak negative correlation between high socialization time and PSQI (-0.06) could hint at factors contributing to sleep variability. Given the overall profile, particularly the inconsistent sleep timing, it is more likely the participant falls into the bottom 50% of the study population for PSQI scores, indicating relatively good to average sleep quality.

46418,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that are relevant to sleep quality. Regarding psychological well-being, the participant reports moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 18, Z-score 0.49), suggesting a slightly elevated burden of such symptoms compared to the study population. Conversely, their trait anxiety levels appear to be within the average range (STAI score of 38, Z-score -0.33), and self-esteem is also at the population average (Self-Esteem score of 38, Z-Score -0.03). Happiness levels are slightly above average (Current happiness score of 4.0, Z-Score 0.55). A notable finding is the participant's significantly lower than average reported health satisfaction (Score of 2.67, Z-score -1.2), which could be an indicator of broader health concerns or a negative self-perception of physical well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with weekly consumption of beer and wine/liquor occurring 1-2 times per week, which is above the population average for these categories (Beer Z-Score 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-Score 0.94). Importantly, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all,"" aligning with population norms. Exercise habits indicate regular engagement in physical activity, particularly with others and in sports, both occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Exercised with Others Z-Score 1.23, Sports Z-Score 1.58). This contrasts with exercising alone, which occurs less frequently at ""1-2 times a week"" (Frequency Z-Score 0.32). Daily recreation involves significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-Score 1.28), while other leisure activities like video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing, reading, and sedentary hobbies are within or below average time allocations.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a generally stable circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (Value 0.53, Z-Score 1.0), suggesting some day-to-day regularity, although intradaily variability is notably low (Value 0.3, Z-Score -1.73), indicating a less dynamic fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly elevated (Value 78.2, Z-Score 0.58) relative to the population. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also high (Value 15.07, Z-Score 1.39), suggesting a significant difference between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is reported around 5:55 PM. Resting heart rate is average (Value 57.8, Z-Score -0.04). Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Heart rate is lowest in the early morning hours, with substantial negative deviations occurring between 2 AM and 7 AM, particularly pronounced between 6 AM and 7 AM (e.g., -23.25 deviation from mesor). As the day progresses, heart rate increases, with significant positive deviations observed in the late afternoon and evening, peaking between 5 PM and 6 PM (26.09 deviation from mesor) and remaining elevated through the evening. This pattern reflects a typical diurnal cardiovascular rhythm, with a pronounced evening acitivity peak.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally adequate sleep duration, with a median duration of 7 hours and 44 minutes, which is above average (Z-Score 0.69). The variability in sleep duration is below average (Value of 64 minutes, Z-Score -0.84), suggesting more consistent sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is late, at 1:49 AM, and the variability in sleep start times is also below average (Value of 52 minutes, Z-Score -0.68), indicating a relatively consistent, albeit late, bedtime. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Value 0.0, Z-Score -0.86) further supports a pattern of consolidated sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data suggests a profile that is more aligned with the **bottom 50%** of the study population for PSQI scores, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. While the participant reports moderate depressive symptoms, which can be associated with poorer sleep quality, their trait anxiety is average and self-esteem is within normal ranges. Critically, their objective sleep metrics from the wearable device point towards positive sleep habits: a longer than average sleep duration, and lower than average variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time, coupled with no reported naps. The median sleep start time of nearly 2 AM, while late, is consistent, suggesting a stable sleep schedule.

The positive correlations with sleep quality are seen in the negative correlations with health satisfaction (Score Correlation -0.21), which, if interpreted as higher satisfaction correlating with better sleep, would lean towards better sleep for this participant. Similarly, the negative correlation between socializing with friends and PSQI score (Score Correlation -0.06) also suggests that more socializing, which this participant does less of, might be associated with poorer sleep, thus implying their current level might be conducive to better sleep. The low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-Score -1.73) and moderate interdaily stability (Z-Score 1.0) also suggest a structured physiological day, which can indirectly support regular sleep patterns. The minimal impact of negative correlations on PSQI score further supports a favorable sleep profile. Although the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, the primary indicators from wearable sleep statistics and some psychological measures lean towards a PSQI score in the lower half of the distribution.

93002,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents a complex profile characterized by generally average to slightly below average psychological and lifestyle indicators, with some notable patterns in their physiological and sleep data. Psychologically, the participant reports moderate levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.13) and average levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.07). Self-esteem appears to be a strength, with a Z-score of -0.87 indicating above-average self-worth. Happiness levels are slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53), and perceived stress is also close to the population mean (Z-score: 0.1). Health satisfaction is notably lower than average, with a Z-score of -0.78. The participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs all have Z-scores below -1.0). Physical activity levels are mixed; while they engage in solitary exercise infrequently (1-2 times a month, Z-score: -0.43), they do exercise with others more regularly (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.53). Sedentary leisure activities are predominantly characterized by high internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85), while other passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and reading are reported as ""Do not do."" Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score: 0.16).

The wearable data reveals a generally consistent circadian rhythm, as indicated by a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.67) and intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.24). The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 0.81) further supports this regularity. The mesor, a measure of the central tendency of the circadian rhythm, is notably low (Z-score: -1.24), suggesting a lower overall daily physiological baseline compared to the population. Correspondingly, the resting heart rate is also significantly lower than average (Z-score: -1.18), which aligns with a lower mesor. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.3), indicating a moderate fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:48 PM).

An examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights a pattern of significantly reduced heart rate during the early morning hours. Specifically, deviations are most negative between 3 AM and 6 AM, with the most pronounced dip occurring between 5 AM and 6 AM (-27.0 deviation, Z-score: -1.25). Conversely, heart rate activity tends to increase in the late afternoon and evening, with the highest positive deviations observed between 7 PM and 8 PM (23.88 deviation, Z-score: 2.16). This pattern suggests a prolonged period of physiological rest or reduced arousal in the early morning, followed by a gradual increase in cardiovascular activity leading into the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a shorter than average median sleep duration (6 hours 28 minutes, Z-score: -0.88). The variability in sleep duration (120 minutes, Z-score: 0.43) and sleep start time (103 minutes, Z-score: 0.43) are both within the average range, suggesting a degree of consistency in sleep patterns once initiated. The median sleep start time of 1:16 AM is notably late, aligning with the observed physiological patterns of extended reduced activity in the early morning. The participant also reports an average of 0.18 daily naps, which is higher than the population mean (Z-score: 1.21), suggesting potential daytime sleepiness or attempts to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Analyzing the available data in relation to the PSQI score, several factors point towards a potentially poorer sleep quality, suggesting the participant may fall in the top 50% of the distribution (higher PSQI score). The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 28 minutes is notably shorter than the population mean and exhibits a negative Z-score (-0.88), indicating a tendency towards insufficient sleep duration, a key component of poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the median sleep start time of 1:16 AM is quite late, which often correlates with disrupted sleep patterns and difficulty initiating sleep. The higher than average frequency of daily naps (Z-score: 1.21) could be indicative of daytime fatigue, often a consequence of poor nighttime sleep.

While some self-reported psychological measures are within the average range (e.g., CES-D, STAI), lower health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.78) can sometimes be linked to subjective feelings of poor well-being, which can encompass sleep. The consistently low heart rate deviations in the early morning hours, coupled with a late sleep start time and shorter sleep duration, suggest a disruption in the natural sleep-wake cycle. The positive correlations between sleep duration and PSQI score (0.06), sleep start time standard deviation and PSQI score (0.18), and mean daily naps and PSQI score (0.17) all suggest that shorter sleep duration, more variable sleep onset, and increased napping are associated with worse sleep quality as measured by the PSQI.

Considering the evidence of shorter sleep duration, late sleep onset, and increased napping, all of which are known contributors to reduced sleep quality, it is likely that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the higher range of the study population. This would place them in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating relatively poorer sleep quality.

56543,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by elevated levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as indicated by their STAI score (Z = 0.86) and CES-D score (Z = 0.49). These elevated scores suggest a potential for increased psychological distress, which can significantly influence sleep patterns and overall well-being. Conversely, their self-esteem is relatively lower (Z = -0.73), and happiness levels are also below average (Z = -0.53), further contributing to a picture of potential psychological vulnerability. This psychological state is accompanied by a below-average reported satisfaction with their physical health (Z = 0.88), which, while not directly indicative of poor sleep, can be a contributing factor to general well-being and thus sleep quality.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in significantly high levels of internet usage (Z = 2.19) and extensive reading (Z = 4.24), suggesting a considerable amount of sedentary time, particularly during waking hours. This is further supported by a high frequency of exercising alone (Z = 1.07), but a low frequency of exercising with others and participating in sports, indicating a preference for solitary physical activity. Notably, substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, positioning them favorably in this domain.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a notably higher than average resting heart rate (Z = 1.17) and a higher mesor (Z = 1.14), indicating a generally elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The circadian rhythm metrics suggest a moderate level of interdaily stability (Z = 0.67) and intradaily variability (Z = 0.32) in heart rate, implying a somewhat structured, yet not exceptionally robust, daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the early evening (6:44 PM), which is relatively early compared to typical diurnal patterns. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late evening and nighttime hours. There are notable peaks in heart rate deviation between 9-10 PM (Z = 3.28) and 10-11 PM (Z = 5.94), suggesting periods of physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, earlier morning hours (4-7 AM) show the most significant negative deviations, indicative of lower heart rate during that period, which is typical for sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes, which is below the average, with a corresponding Z-score of -0.94. The sleep duration itself is relatively consistent, with a standard deviation of 71 minutes (Z = -0.67). However, the median sleep start time is remarkably late, at 2:22 AM, with a standard deviation of 60 minutes (Z = -0.5), suggesting a highly irregular sleep schedule. The low PSQI correlation for sleep duration and sleep start time suggests that these objective measures, while present, might not be the strongest predictors of subjective sleep quality for this individual. The presence of a small average daily nap (0.1, Z = 0.31) is also noted.

## Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Based on the provided data, the participant demonstrates several factors that would likely contribute to a poorer subjective sleep quality, placing them in the top 50% of the study population distribution for PSQI scores.

Evidence for a high PSQI score (top 50th percentile, indicating relatively poor sleep quality) is strongly supported by the psychological profile. Elevated anxiety (STAI Z=0.86) and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z=0.49) are significantly correlated with poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, lower self-esteem (Z=-0.73) and happiness (Z=-0.53), along with lower health satisfaction (Z=0.88), are also associated with negative psychological states that can negatively impact sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant's sleep schedule is a significant concern. A median sleep start time of 2:22 AM, with considerable variability (SD 60 minutes), is indicative of a severely disrupted circadian rhythm and social jetlag, which is a strong predictor of poor sleep quality. While the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes is not extremely low, it is below average and may contribute to daytime fatigue. The substantial amount of sedentary internet usage (Z=2.19) could also indirectly influence sleep by displacing more beneficial activities or by leading to prolonged cognitive stimulation before bed.

While objective physiological data, such as the elevated resting heart rate (Z=1.17) and mesor (Z=1.14), and the late evening heart rate deviations (e.g., 10-11 PM Z=5.94), suggest a body that is not effectively winding down for sleep, the direct correlations with PSQI are weak. However, the overall picture points towards a constellation of psychological distress and significant behavioral disruptions in sleep timing that are highly likely to result in a subjectively poor sleep experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that this participant would score in the upper half of the PSQI distribution.

89142,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile concerning their psychological state, behavioral habits, and physiological regulation, which may have implications for their sleep quality. Self-reported data indicate a relatively low level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of 0.66, placing them slightly above the population mean but not significantly high), and a notably low reported stress level (Z-score of -5.88), suggesting a generally calm disposition. Their self-esteem is above average (Z-score of -0.87, indicating higher self-esteem), and they report being relatively happy (Z-score of -0.53) and trusting of others (Z-score of -0.46). Notably, this participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and engages in no structured exercise (exercised alone, with others, or sports). Their engagement in sedentary activities is mixed, with significant time spent on reading (Z-score of 2.28) and video games (Z-score of 1.71), while reporting ""do not do"" for watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies. This pattern suggests a preference for solitary, intellectually engaging, or recreational screen-based activities. Their health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score of -2.45), which, despite other positive psychological indicators, warrants attention.

Wearable data reveals a concerning pattern in sleep duration and timing. The median sleep duration is significantly low at 5 hours and 50 minutes (Z-score of -1.68), suggesting chronic sleep restriction. The standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively high (Z-score of 0.51), indicating considerable variability in nightly sleep length. The median sleep start time is very late, at 1:01 AM, with a standard deviation of 60 minutes, further suggesting irregular sleep timing. This is accompanied by a low mesor (mean heart rate level) of 60.11 bpm (Z-score of -1.89), which is considerably lower than the population average, and a resting heart rate of 45.6 bpm (Z-score of -1.49), also suggesting a lower than average physiological arousal baseline. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.33) and slightly below-average intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.74), indicating some regularity in daily physiological patterns but less fluctuation within a day. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a clear pattern of physiological arousal deviating from the mesor throughout the day. Specifically, heart rate deviates negatively from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with deviations ranging from -16.9 to -24.83 bpm), suggesting a period of low physiological activity, consistent with sleep. Conversely, positive deviations from the mesor are observed during the mid-morning to late afternoon (e.g., 9-10 AM with a deviation of 16.47 bpm, 6-7 PM with a deviation of 18.57 bpm), indicating periods of higher physiological arousal typically associated with wakefulness and activity. The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, is noted at 3:57 PM, aligning with the periods of increased heart rate deviation. The lack of naps (mean daily naps Z-score of 0.7) suggests that sleep debt is not being significantly compensated for during the day.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a potentially low sleep quality, aligning them with the higher end of the PSQI distribution (top 50th percentile). The most compelling evidence is their significantly reduced median sleep duration (5 hours 50 minutes, Z-score of -1.68) and the variability in sleep start time (median 1:01 AM, SD 60 minutes), which directly contribute to poor sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. While their psychological profile is generally positive with low stress and moderate anxiety, and they are not engaging in unhealthy behaviors like substance use, the extreme restriction and irregularity of their sleep are significant detractors. The low health satisfaction score (Z-score of -2.45) may also indirectly reflect the impact of poor sleep. The wearable data, particularly the low mesor and resting heart rate, combined with the late sleep onset, suggest a disrupted circadian system which is a key component in sleep quality assessment. Although correlations with PSQI score are provided as a guide, the primary analysis must focus on the direct indicators of sleep quantity and regularity. Given the substantial objective evidence of insufficient and irregular sleep, it is highly probable that this participant's PSQI score would fall within the top 50th percentile, indicating poor sleep quality relative to the study population.

24898,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a moderate level of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as indicated by their STAI score (Z-score: 0.37) and CES-D score (Z-score: 0.07), respectively. While these scores fall within a relatively neutral range for the population, the anxiety score is slightly elevated. Self-esteem is notable for being below average, with a Z-score of -1.01, suggesting a lower sense of self-worth. This is further supported by a below-average trust score (Z-score: -1.10) and slightly above-average happiness (Z-score: 0.55). Health satisfaction is also below the population mean (Z-score: 0.88), indicating a lower perceived quality of physical health.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in higher-than-average levels of physical activity, as evidenced by the frequency of exercising alone (Z-score: 1.07), exercising with others (Z-score: 1.23), and participating in sports (Z-score: 1.58). Conversely, the participant reports no engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -1.25) and very low internet usage (Z-score: -1.16). However, there is a significant predilection for listening to music, with a time investment of over 4 hours daily (Z-score: 2.06), and a substantial amount of time dedicated to reading (31 minutes to 1 hour, Z-score: 2.28). Socializing with friends is also a moderate activity (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95). Substance usage is minimal, with beer and wine/liquor consumed less than 1-2 times a month, and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with an Interdaily Stability score of 0.65 (Z-score: 1.99), indicating good regularity in daily patterns. Intradaily Variability is lower than average (Z-score: -1.45), suggesting less fluctuation within the day. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.33), and the Amplitude is notably high (Z-score: 1.64), suggesting a larger daily variation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is recorded at 4:05 PM. Resting heart rate is below average (Z-score: -1.04). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a pattern of significantly lower-than-average heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score: -2.36; 2-3 AM, Z-score: -2.31; 3-4 AM, Z-score: -2.20; 4-5 AM, Z-score: -2.22). Conversely, heart rate elevates above the mesor during midday and afternoon, with peaks observed between 2-3 PM (Z-score: 2.62) and 6-7 PM (Z-score: 2.15). This pattern suggests a pronounced dip in physiological activity during the typical sleep period.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -1.18). The variability in sleep duration is also relatively low (Z-score: -0.88). The median sleep start time is late at night (00:54:29), with a standard deviation of 34 minutes, suggesting some consistency in this late sleep onset. There are no reported daily naps.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

To determine the participant's PSQI group, we need to holistically assess the evidence for good or poor sleep quality in relation to the population distribution. The population PSQI mean is 6.73, with a median of 6.0 and a 75th percentile of 8.0. A PSQI score below 6.0 is generally considered good, while scores above 8.0 suggest significant sleep disturbance.

Evidence for potentially lower (better) PSQI scores (bottom 50%):

*   **Low Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.45):** Lower variability in heart rate throughout the day can be indicative of a more stable physiological state, potentially contributing to better sleep.
*   **High Amplitude (Z-score: 1.64):** While a high amplitude can indicate robust daily rhythms, combined with other factors, it might suggest a more pronounced transition into rest.
*   **Low Resting Heart Rate (Z-score: -1.04):** A lower resting heart rate is generally associated with better cardiovascular health and can be a marker of good physical conditioning, which often correlates with better sleep.
*   **Low Substance Usage:** Minimal alcohol and drug use (all Z-scores are negative, indicating less than average use) generally correlates with better sleep quality.
*   **High Physical Activity:** Consistent and frequent engagement in sports and exercise (all Z-scores are positive and above 1.0) is typically associated with improved sleep quality.
*   **Low Internet Usage (Z-score: -1.16):** Limited screen time, particularly in the evening, can positively impact sleep.

Evidence for potentially higher (poorer) PSQI scores (top 50%):

*   **Below Average Sleep Duration (Median 6 hours 14 minutes, Z-score: -1.18):** This directly indicates insufficient sleep, a primary contributor to poor sleep quality.
*   **Late Median Sleep Start Time (00:54:29):** A very late sleep onset time can disrupt the natural circadian rhythm and lead to difficulties in achieving sufficient sleep before morning obligations.
*   **Elevated Anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.37):** While not extremely high, the tendency towards anxiety can negatively impact sleep onset and maintenance.
*   **Below Average Self-Esteem (Z-Score: -1.01):** Lower self-esteem has been linked to increased rumination and worry, which can interfere with sleep.
*   **Below Average Health Satisfaction (Z-score: 0.88):** Dissatisfaction with physical health can be a symptom or consequence of poor sleep.
*   **Pronounced Heart Rate Dip During Sleep Hours:** The significant deviations of heart rate from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -24.43 to -31.54) indicate a substantial drop in physiological arousal during the typical sleep window, which, when coupled with insufficient sleep duration, might suggest a fragmented or non-restorative sleep pattern.

Holistic analysis:

The participant exhibits several behaviors and physiological indicators typically associated with good sleep, such as high physical activity, low substance use, and low daily variability. However, the direct measures of sleep duration and sleep timing are concerning. A median sleep duration of under 6.5 hours is consistently linked to poorer subjective and objective sleep quality, and a sleep start time close to 1 AM, with a relatively consistent schedule, further suggests a chronotype that may be misaligned with typical daily demands, potentially leading to sleep deprivation. The relatively low self-esteem and above-average anxiety, while not extreme, can exacerbate sleep difficulties. The significant heart rate reduction during sleep hours, while indicative of physiological rest, might also reflect a sleep architecture that is not optimally restorative given the insufficient duration.

Considering the PSQI population data (median 6.0, 75th percentile 8.0), the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, coupled with a late sleep onset, strongly suggests that this participant is likely experiencing insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep duration is a significant contributor to a high PSQI score. Therefore, it is probable that this participant's overall sleep quality would place them in the poorer half of the distribution.

The participant exhibits a generally low level of psychological distress. Their score on the CES-D scale (6.0) falls below the typical range for depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score (31.0) indicates minimal chronic anxiety. This psychological profile is further supported by a relatively high self-esteem score (46.0), which is above the population average as indicated by a positive Z-score of 1.1. Happiness (current score 3.0) and health satisfaction (2.67) also appear to be within a normal range, with Z-scores suggesting they are not extremes within the study population. Notably, the participant reports very low levels of substance usage across all categories, significantly below the average for the study population as indicated by their negative Z-scores.

Regarding daily behaviors and activities, the participant demonstrates a strong engagement in exercise, reporting exercising alone three times a week or more, a frequency significantly higher than the population average (Z-score of 1.07). Conversely, they engage in exercising with others infrequently (less than 1-2 times a month), and participate in sports on a monthly basis. Their daily recreational habits are characterized by low engagement in screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games. Significantly, their reported internet usage is exceptionally low, with a Z-score of -2.5 indicating minimal to no reported usage in this category. They spend a modest amount of time listening to music (15 minutes or less) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less). Socializing with friends is reported as 1-2 hours, which is around the population average. The participant dedicates a notable amount of time to reading (16-30 minutes), exceeding the population average as indicated by a Z-score of 1.3. This pattern suggests a lifestyle that prioritizes intellectual engagement and physical activity over passive screen time.

The wearable data provides insights into the participant's physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. Their resting heart rate (55.4) is slightly below the population average, suggesting good cardiovascular health. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a reasonably stable daily pattern, with an Interdaily Stability (0.36) slightly below average and an Intradaily Variability (0.76) above average, the latter potentially reflecting more dynamic physiological responses throughout the day. The Mesor (75.18) and Amplitude (10.99) of their heart rate rhythm are close to population averages. The Acrophase, at 6:27 PM, indicates the peak time of their heart rate rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of heightened physiological arousal in the late evening and nighttime, particularly between 10-11 PM (deviation of 22.05), and to a lesser extent between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM. Conversely, significant dips in heart rate deviation from the Mesor occur in the late morning and early afternoon, from 3-4 PM to 2-3 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes, which is slightly longer than the population median, and the variability in sleep duration is lower than average, suggesting consistent sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is around 12:32 AM, with moderate variability. The mean daily nap frequency is very low. The correlation analyses suggest weak relationships between most of these metrics and the PSQI score, with a few exceptions. For instance, higher CES-D scores and stress levels show a moderate positive correlation with PSQI, suggesting that increased depressive symptoms and stress might be associated with poorer sleep quality. Conversely, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction show a moderate negative correlation, implying that better self-worth and health perceptions may be linked to better sleep quality.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides several indicators that suggest their PSQI score is likely to fall within the lower half of the study population distribution, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Their psychological profile is characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem, all of which are generally associated with better sleep. Their lifestyle is notably healthy, with very low substance usage, high engagement in solitary exercise, and a preference for reading and socializing over passive screen time. This alignment of positive psychological traits and healthy behaviors is strongly predictive of good sleep hygiene.

Furthermore, the wearable data indicates a sufficient median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes, exceeding the average, and a low standard deviation in sleep duration, suggesting consistent sleep patterns. While the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows some notable deviations from the mesor during specific late evening and early morning hours, these do not appear to be strongly correlated with PSQI in this dataset. The low average daily nap frequency also supports the notion of consolidated nighttime sleep. The moderate positive correlations between depressive symptoms and stress with PSQI, and negative correlations with self-esteem and health satisfaction, when considered alongside the participant's favorable scores in these areas, lean towards a better sleep quality outcome. Without a direct PSQI score, the cumulative evidence from psychological well-being, lifestyle choices, and objective sleep duration and consistency strongly suggests a favorable sleep quality profile.

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their sleep quality. Notably, the participant reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 20.0 (Z-score = 0.7), which falls into the ""Depressed"" classification. This is accompanied by a slightly elevated anxiety proneness, reflected in a STAI score of 43.0 (Z-score = 0.17). While self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score = -0.31), trust levels (Z-score = 0.83) and self-reported happiness (Z-score = 0.55) are slightly above average. Stress levels are reported as moderate (Z-score = -0.44), suggesting a balanced experience in this domain. Educational attainment is high, with GPAs consistently at or near 4.0. Health satisfaction is below average (Z-score = -0.86), which could be a contributing factor to overall well-being.

Behavioral patterns reveal a generally low engagement in substance use, with beer consumption occurring less than 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is notably low; exercise, whether alone or with others, and participation in sports occur at most 1-2 times a month, with a particularly low Z-score (-1.58) for exercising with others, indicating infrequent engagement. Daily sedentary habits include limited internet usage (16-30 minutes), while activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are not part of their routine. There is a moderate amount of socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour), and a significant engagement in reading (16-30 minutes), with a Z-score of 1.3 for this activity.

Physiological data from wearable devices indicate a circadian rhythm with a higher than average Mesor (Value = 83.16, Z-score = 1.26), suggesting a generally elevated baseline heart rate. The amplitude of this rhythm is below average (Value = 7.73, Z-score = -0.99), implying a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time for heart rate, is reported as 4:00 PM. Interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (Value = 0.49, Z-score = 0.67), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns, while intradaily variability is also moderate (Value = 0.49, Z-score = -0.39). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below average (Value = 0.28, Z-score = -0.36), indicating a modest degree of daily rhythmicity. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated (Value = 68.7, Z-score = 1.25). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -13.83, 3-4 AM: -16.05, 4-5 AM: -15.48). Heart rate tends to increase above the Mesor as the morning progresses, with the highest positive deviations observed between 8-9 AM (12.29) and 9-10 AM (8.95). Heart rate deviations remain positive but decrease in magnitude throughout the afternoon and evening, with notable dips in the late evening hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -0.8). The variability in sleep duration is high (Value = 166 minutes, Z-score = 1.49), suggesting inconsistent sleep lengths from night to night. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:19 AM, which is relatively late, and the standard deviation for sleep start time is moderate (Value = 62 minutes, Z-score = -0.45). There are no recorded daily naps (Value = 0.0, Z-score = -0.86).

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The participant's data provides evidence that may contribute to a higher or lower PSQI score. On the lower end (bottom 50th percentile, representing better sleep quality), the participant's relatively low levels of substance use, low stress levels, and consistent, high academic performance are neutral or potentially beneficial factors. Their engagement in reading (Z-score = 1.3) is a positive habit. However, a considerable portion of the evidence points towards factors that might contribute to a higher PSQI score (top 50th percentile, representing poorer sleep quality). The reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score = 0.7) and elevated anxiety proneness (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score = 0.17) are well-established correlates of poorer sleep quality. Their below-average health satisfaction also suggests a potential underlying issue impacting well-being.

Behaviorally, the extremely low frequency of exercise, particularly exercising with others (Z-score = -1.58), and infrequent engagement in sports and other forms of exercise are detrimental to sleep hygiene. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes is below the population average, and the high variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.49) suggests significant inconsistency, a key indicator of poor sleep quality. The late median sleep start time further contributes to a disrupted sleep schedule. The physiological data, while complex, shows an elevated resting heart rate and a higher Mesor, which can be associated with stress or other physiological challenges that might affect sleep. The correlations provided in the data, though not the sole basis of interpretation, generally show small positive correlations between measures like CES-D, STAI, Stress, and PSQI score. The negative correlations with Self-Esteem and Trust are less indicative. Given the combination of psychological distress (depression, anxiety), poor sleep hygiene practices (low exercise), objectively shorter and highly variable sleep duration, and a late sleep onset, it is most likely that this participant would fall into the top 50th percentile for PSQI score, indicating poorer sleep quality.

88882,6.0,0.387434554973822,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates a consistent pattern of lower-than-average psychological distress and higher-than-average academic achievement. Their CES-D score (2.0) and STAI-Trait score (28.0) are notably below the population means, suggesting a low burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety. This is further supported by their high GPA (3.93-4.0) and significantly positive Z-scores for happiness (1.64) and self-esteem (1.1), indicating a favorable psychological disposition. While their stress score (18.0) is below average Z-score (-0.98), the corresponding positive correlation with PSQI (0.2) warrants consideration in relation to sleep quality.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more, which is above the population average (Z-score 1.07). Their consumption of beer is also above average (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01). Daily recreational habits indicate a moderate engagement with screen time activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with less time spent on reading or sedentary hobbies. Notably, they report listening to music for 1-2 hours daily, a habit that shows a weak positive correlation with PSQI score (0.12).

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a lower-than-average resting heart rate (47.35 bpm, Z-score -1.28). The cosinor analysis reveals a mesor (65.04 bpm, Z-score -1.22) that is also below average, suggesting a generally lower baseline cardiovascular activity. The acrophase at 6:01 PM indicates the peak heart rate typically occurs in the early evening. However, the circadian rhythm metrics present some irregularities. Interdaily stability (0.34, Z-score -0.57) is lower than average, suggesting less consistent daily patterns in heart rate, while intradaily variability (0.63, Z-score 0.6) is slightly higher than average, indicating more fluctuations within a day. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor during the night and early morning. Specifically, there are marked positive deviations between 1-2 AM (14.11, Z-score 3.1) and 8-9 PM (17.22, Z-score 1.34), and substantial negative deviations between 4-6 AM (-20.0 to -24.59). These pronounced deviations, particularly during sleep hours, suggest potential disruptions in the typical physiological patterns.

The participant's sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 57 minutes, which is notably below the population average (Z-score -1.53). The standard deviation of sleep duration (68 minutes, Z-score -0.76) suggests moderate variability in sleep length from night to night. The median sleep start time is very late at 02:34:14, with a standard deviation of 40 minutes, indicating both a delayed and somewhat consistent sleep onset. The low average number of daily naps (0.08, Z-score 0.04) does not suggest napping as a significant factor influencing sleep patterns.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

Analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely falls into the **bottom_50** percentile for their PSQI score, indicating relatively good or average sleep quality. Several indicators support this conclusion. The participant exhibits very low levels of self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D, Z-score -1.18) and chronic anxiety (STAI, Z-score -1.31), which are generally associated with poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, high self-esteem (RSES, Z-score 1.1) and happiness (Z-score 1.64) are typically correlated with better subjective sleep experiences. While their stress score has a positive correlation with PSQI (0.2), it is below average (Z-score -0.98), suggesting stress may not be a significant detractor from sleep quality.

The physiological data, while showing some within-day variability (Intradaily Variability, Z-score 0.6), also presents a lower-than-average mesor and resting heart rate (Z-scores -1.22 and -1.28 respectively), which can sometimes be indicative of a more relaxed physiological state conducive to sleep. Critically, many of the behavioral habits, such as lower alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor, Z-score 0.19), avoidance of recreational and non-prescribed drugs, and moderate engagement with screen time, are not strongly indicative of poor sleep hygiene. The negative correlations between PSQI score and factors like Self-Esteem (-0.35), Trust (-0.21), Happiness (-0.27), and Health Satisfaction (-0.21) further suggest that positive psychological and health states are associated with lower PSQI scores, aligning with the participant's profile.

Although the participant's median sleep duration (5 hours 57 minutes) is considerably short and the sleep start time is late (02:34:14), which are potential markers of poor sleep quality, the absence of significant psychological distress and the presence of positive well-being indicators are more powerful predictors of overall good sleep quality as measured by the PSQI. The PSQI encompasses a broader range of sleep quality factors beyond just duration and timing. Given the strong evidence for positive psychological well-being and general health satisfaction, it is plausible that the participant experiences overall satisfactory sleep despite some objective sleep timing and duration limitations. The relatively weak positive correlations of PSQI with factors like stress (0.2) and heart rate deviations (some are positive, e.g., 2-3 AM, 0.20) compared to the negative correlations with well-being indicators, also support the inference of better sleep quality. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's PSQI score falls within the lower half of the distribution.

This participant presents with elevated levels of psychological distress, characterized by high scores on the CES-D (Z-score 1.32) and STAI (Z-score 1.35), indicating a burden of depressive and chronic anxiety symptoms, respectively. These psychological factors are positively correlated with their PSQI score (0.49 and 0.4, respectively), suggesting a potential link between emotional state and sleep quality. Conversely, self-esteem is within the population average (Z-score -0.45), and higher trust levels (Z-score -2.07) and happiness (Z-score -1.61) are associated with lower PSQI scores, suggesting that positive interpersonal and self-perceptions may contribute to better sleep. Notably, the participant reports high stress levels (Z-score 1.47), which also exhibits a positive correlation with PSQI.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times per week (Z-score 1.01) and wine or liquor 1-2 times per month (Z-score 0.19). Recreational drug use is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score 1.61). Physical activity is more frequent than the population average, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53). Daily recreation habits show a notable time commitment to listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95), and higher engagement in sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41) and watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64). These behavioral patterns show weak to negligible correlations with PSQI, with the exception of exercising alone and socializing, which have small negative correlations.

From the wearable data, the participant exhibits a lower-than-average mesor (Z-score -1.03) and amplitude (Z-score -0.23), suggesting a less pronounced diurnal rhythm in heart rate compared to the general study population. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate activity, is observed in the evening (6:21 PM). The resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score -1.02). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of higher arousal in the late evening and early morning hours. Specifically, the periods between 10-11 PM (Z-score 2.25) and 11 PM-12 AM (Z-score 1.98) show the highest positive deviations, indicating elevated heart rate activity during these times. Conversely, there are significant negative deviations during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score -1.73; 4-5 AM, Z-score -0.49). The circadian rhythm metrics of interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82) and intradaily variability (Z-score -0.25) are within or slightly below the population average, suggesting a moderately regular circadian rhythm. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score 1.14), which is longer than the population average, and a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score 1.23). The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:38:30, with a considerable standard deviation (Z-score 0.92). The average daily nap frequency is also high (Z-score 2.27). These sleep duration and timing metrics have weak positive correlations with PSQI, except for the standard deviation of sleep duration which shows a stronger positive correlation (0.2).

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score

The analysis of the participant's data suggests a PSQI score that likely falls in the upper half of the distribution, indicating poorer sleep quality. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 1.32) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.35), both of which are positively correlated with PSQI, are significant indicators. High stress levels (Z-score 1.47) further reinforce this concern, also correlating positively with PSQI. While the participant reports above-average sleep duration, the substantial variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.23) and the very late median sleep start time (02:38:30) coupled with a high standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score 0.92) suggest significant sleep schedule irregularity. The high average daily nap frequency (Z-score 2.27) may also be indicative of fragmented or insufficient nighttime sleep. Furthermore, the elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 10-11 PM Z-score 2.25, 11 PM-12 AM Z-score 1.98) could reflect physiological arousal that interferes with sleep onset or maintenance. Although certain self-reported factors like higher trust and happiness correlate negatively with PSQI, the cumulative evidence from psychological distress, sleep timing and variability, and physiological arousal patterns points towards a sleep quality that is likely below the population median.

Conversely, internet usage is around 1-2 hours, and reading time is also reported as ""15 minutes or less.""

Wearable data reveals a circadian rhythm characterized by a relatively lower mesor (Mesor Z-score: -0.62) and moderate amplitude (Amplitude Z-score: -0.17). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is observed at 5:35 PM. Physiological arousal patterns, indicated by the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor for heart rate, show significant deviations during late evening and early morning hours. Specifically, there are notable positive deviations between 5-6 PM and 10-11 PM, and a substantial peak in positive deviation from 11 PM to 12 AM (Z-score: 3.51), suggesting increased physiological activity during these times. Conversely, negative deviations are pronounced during the early morning hours, from 2 AM to 6 AM, with the largest negative deviation observed between 5-6 AM (Z-score: -22.83), indicative of reduced physiological activity during this period. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is relatively low (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.33), while intradaily variability is slightly above average (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.1). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: -0.87), suggesting a less consistent daily rhythm. The resting heart rate is within a normal range, with a slightly below-average Z-score (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.34).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 54 minutes, which is slightly below average for the population (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.35). The standard deviation of sleep duration is close to the population average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.05). The median sleep start time is approximately 00:19, and the standard deviation of sleep start time is notably low (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.93), suggesting a relatively consistent bedtime. The participant does not report any daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86). The correlations between various self-reported measures and the PSQI score are generally weak and do not consistently point towards a particular direction. For instance, while higher CES-D scores and stress levels correlate positively with PSQI, indicating a potential link between negative affect and poorer sleep, these correlations are moderate. Similarly, higher self-esteem and happiness show weak negative correlations, suggesting a tendency for better sleep with higher well-being, but the effect size is small. The limited correlations suggest that while psychological and behavioral factors may play a role, they are not overwhelmingly predictive of PSQI scores in this dataset. The moderate sleep duration, coupled with consistent sleep start times, suggests a potential for mild sleep disturbances, but the overall picture does not strongly indicate severe sleep issues based solely on these metrics.

Considering the available data, the participant's sleep quality, as indicated by their likely PSQI score, would place them in the **bottom_50** of the study population. While the median sleep duration is slightly below the average and thus might contribute to a higher PSQI score, the individual demonstrates several factors that typically correlate with better sleep quality. These include low levels of depression and anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, minimal substance use, high engagement in exercise, and relatively consistent sleep start times. The low standard deviation in sleep start times is particularly indicative of a structured sleep schedule. Although the early morning heart rate deviations suggest potential physiological disruption, the overall pattern of psychological well-being and healthy lifestyle behaviors points towards a more favorable sleep quality profile relative to the study population. The weak and inconsistent correlations with PSQI further suggest that the participant's sleep quality is not strongly influenced by the examined negative psychological states or unhealthy habits in a way that would push their score into the higher (poorer sleep) half of the distribution.

The participant exhibits a moderate level of anxiety as indicated by a STAI score of 45.0, which falls within the anxious classification. This is accompanied by a near-average score on the CES-D scale (14.0), suggesting a lack of significant depressive symptoms. Self-esteem appears to be relatively high, with a score of 40.0, reaching the maximum possible score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Happiness levels are also reported as moderately high (4.0 on a scale where higher is better, with a Z-score of 0.55). Conversely, stress levels are slightly below average (21.0 on a scale where higher is more stressed, with a Z-score of -0.17). Health satisfaction is notably low, with a score of 3.22, suggesting a potential area of concern regarding the participant's perception of their physical well-being.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported as less than 1-2 times a month or not at all, aligning with relatively low substance use. The participant does not engage in any form of exercise, including exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, as indicated by Z-scores of -1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively. Daily recreational activities are largely sedentary, with time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, using the internet, and listening to music generally being 30 minutes or less. Socializing with friends and reading are also reported as minimal activities.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is within the normal range, with a value of 56.9 and a Z-score of -0.15. The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of arousal. There is a significant decrease in heart rate deviations from the mesor during the early morning hours (3-4 AM showing the largest negative deviation of -24.88), which is consistent with the body's reduced physiological activity during sleep. Conversely, a notable increase in heart rate deviations is observed during the evening and night, particularly between 7-8 PM (24.66) and 9-10 PM (16.06), suggesting periods of higher cardiovascular activity during these times. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a moderately regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.48 with a Z-score of 0.58), suggesting consistent daily patterns. However, intradaily variability is notably low (0.35 with a Z-score of -1.38), which might suggest a lack of sufficient physiological fluctuation throughout the day. The mesor (82.2, Z-score 1.13) and amplitude (16.02, Z-score 1.69) of the heart rate rhythm are both elevated, indicating a higher average heart rate and a greater range of fluctuation throughout the day compared to the study population. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is reported as 5:43 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 49 minutes, which is slightly below the average for the study population (Z-score of -0.46). The variability in sleep duration is higher than average, as indicated by a sleep duration standard deviation of 151 minutes (Z-score 1.14). The median sleep start time is late, at 01:28:09 AM, with a standard deviation of 80 minutes indicating some inconsistency in sleep onset. Daily naps are minimal (0.07, Z-score -0.02).

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSQI Score**

The participant's sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), needs to be evaluated in the context of the provided population data. The population mean PSQI score is 6.72, with a standard deviation of 2.16. The 50th percentile (median) is 6.0, and the 75th percentile is 8.0. A lower PSQI score indicates better sleep quality, while a higher score indicates poorer sleep quality.

Several factors in the data suggest a potentially poorer sleep quality, which would place the participant in the top 50th percentile for PSQI score. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 49 minutes, which is slightly less than what is generally recommended for optimal sleep, and the standard deviation of sleep duration is significantly higher than average, indicating considerable inconsistency in sleep duration. The late median sleep start time (01:28:09 AM) and its standard deviation suggest a disrupted or irregular sleep schedule.

While the participant reports moderate anxiety and happiness, and high self-esteem, these psychological factors do not strongly mitigate the objective and subjective indicators of sleep disruption. The absence of exercise and relatively sedentary daily habits may also contribute to poorer sleep hygiene. The elevated amplitude and mesor of the heart rate rhythm, along with the late acrophase, could reflect underlying physiological stress or a poorly regulated circadian system, which can negatively impact sleep. The moderate correlation between several sleep-related metrics and PSQI score, such as sleep duration standard deviation (0.2), suggests that variability in sleep patterns is associated with poorer sleep quality.

Considering the slightly reduced sleep duration, significantly increased variability in sleep duration, late and variable sleep start times, and the physiological indicators of an irregular circadian rhythm, it is plausible that the participant's overall PSQI score is higher than the median, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population, indicating poorer sleep quality.
