44869,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators. Self-reported data reveal moderate levels of depressive symptomatology (CES-D score of 22.0, Z-score of 0.9), which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28). While trait anxiety scores are within the non-anxious range (STAI score of 39.0, Z-score of -0.23), the presence of depressive symptoms warrants consideration. Self-esteem is reported as high (Rosenberg score of 40.0, Z-score of 0.26), which typically acts as a buffer against stress. However, sleep quality is significantly compromised, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score of 1.52), classifying it as disturbed sleep. This aligns with objective sleep data showing a higher-than-average median sleep duration (8 hours 26 minutes, Z-score of 1.55) but a considerably elevated variability in sleep duration (193 minutes, Z-score of 2.09) and sleep start time (157 minutes, Z-score of 1.63). This inconsistency in sleep patterns is a critical factor, as both PSQI and sleep variability demonstrate positive correlations with perceived stress (though not explicitly provided for PSS here, these are strong indicators of potential stress impact).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a sedentary lifestyle with high engagement in passive recreational activities. Notably, time spent watching TV/videos/movies (2-3 hours, Z-score of 1.91) and sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours, Z-score of 3.19) are significantly elevated compared to the study population. Conversely, engagement in exercising with others and sports is notably low. Internet usage and listening to music are also at higher-than-average levels. Substance usage is reported as not at all for all categories. These behavioral patterns, particularly prolonged sedentary time and high passive media consumption, may contribute to or be a consequence of elevated stress levels.

Physiologically, the participant presents with a high resting heart rate (78.4 bpm, Z-score of 2.41) and a higher-than-average Mesor (88.34, Z-score of 1.97), indicating a generally elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively stable rhythm in terms of interdaily stability (0.43, Z-score of 0.17), but with high intradaily variability (0.71, Z-score of 1.16), suggesting fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The hourly deviation from the mesor data indicates a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am with -8.86 deviation, Z-score of 1.18; 4-5 am with -10.83 deviation, Z-score of 1.21; 5-6 am with -10.5 deviation, Z-score of 1.14), followed by a marked increase as the morning progresses, peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 5-6 pm with 10.28 deviation, Z-score of -0.03). This pattern of significant early morning heart rate suppression and later increase could be indicative of a disrupted sleep-wake cycle or a physiological response to nocturnal stressors, despite reported longer sleep durations. The positive correlations between several early morning hourly heart rate deviations and perceived stress (e.g., 0.19 for 3-4 am, 0.2 for 4-5 am, 0.22 for 5-6 am) further support this interpretation.

Given the elevated CES-D score indicating depressive symptoms, significantly disturbed sleep quality, marked variability in sleep onset and duration, high resting heart rate, and pronounced fluctuations in hourly heart rate deviations, particularly during early morning hours, this participant likely experiences a high level of perceived stress. The sedentary lifestyle and high passive recreational activities might also be contributing factors or coping mechanisms associated with stress. While self-esteem is high, the confluence of the other indicators points towards an overall stress profile that places them in the upper half of the study population.

92552,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This analysis synthesizes multimodal data to understand the psychological state and behavioral patterns of a university student, with a particular focus on perceived stress. The participant reports moderate levels of anxiety, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 45, which falls within the upper range of the anxiety-prone classification, with a Z-score of 0.37. Concurrently, their self-esteem is relatively high (RSES score of 44, Z-score of 0.82), suggesting a potential buffer against negative psychological states. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are not clinically elevated (score of 15, Z-score of 0.18), and their perceived happiness is also on the higher side of average (score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55).

Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (score of 8.0, Z-score of 0.59), which is a common correlate of increased stress. This subjective report is further supported by objective sleep data from the Fitbit. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes is notably longer than average (Z-score of 0.79), but the standard deviation of sleep duration is significantly elevated (174 minutes, Z-score of 1.66), suggesting considerable variability and inconsistency in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time of 3:48 AM is exceptionally late, with a standard deviation of 94 minutes indicating further disruption in sleep timing. Mean daily naps are also high, with a Z-score of 1.75, potentially reflecting attempts to compensate for poor nighttime sleep.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a low resting heart rate (48.8 bpm, Z-score of -1.11), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. However, the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal notable patterns. There are significant positive deviations, suggesting elevated arousal, during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am: 12.4, Z-score 2.03; 1-2 am: 12.86, Z-score 2.92; 2-3 am: 16.07, Z-score 4.03; 3-4 am: 1.52, Z-score 2.83; 11 pm-12 am: 15.31, Z-score 1.77). Conversely, there are substantial negative deviations, indicating lower physiological activity, during mid-morning hours (e.g., 9-10 am: -20.27, Z-score -2.57; 10-11 am: -17.21, Z-score -3.25; 11 am-12 pm: -15.4, Z-score -3.45). This pattern suggests a potential dysregulation in the circadian rhythm, with increased physiological activation during typical sleep periods and decreased activity during typical waking hours. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (0.38, Z-score -0.24) and intradaily variability (0.59, Z-score 0.32), do not strongly suggest a highly regular rhythm.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, with above-average Z-scores for usage. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise habits include exercising alone 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational activities show a tendency towards passive engagement, with low reported time spent on watching TV/videos/movies and video games, but also low engagement in reading. Internet usage and listening to music are reported as 1-2 hours daily, which is around average. Socializing with friends is also reported as 1-2 hours, which is a moderate level.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, considering the convergence of disturbed subjective sleep quality, highly variable sleep duration and timing, and distinct patterns of physiological arousal deviating from a typical circadian rhythm, suggests a profile of elevated stress. While self-esteem and happiness are relatively high, and depression is not a concern, the objective and subjective indicators of sleep disruption and physiological dysregulation are significant. The negative correlation between higher PSQI scores and PSS is notable, aligning with the finding of disturbed sleep. Furthermore, the positive correlations between several metrics associated with sleep disturbance (e.g., sleep duration standard deviation, mean daily naps) and PSS contribute to this interpretation. Despite a relatively low resting heart rate, the significant deviations in hourly heart rate, particularly the elevated arousal during late night/early morning hours, point towards a stressed physiological state that may be impacting their sleep and overall well-being.

Based on the analysis of the available data, the participant's indicators of disturbed sleep quality and quantity, coupled with significant physiological deviations in heart rate patterns suggestive of circadian dysregulation, lean towards an elevated stress profile. Considering these factors in conjunction with the potential impact of anxiety, it is likely that the participant's perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population.

73158,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological and behavioral data with wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics to understand perceived stress in a university student population. The participant exhibits several characteristics that suggest a relatively lower level of perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.38) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -1.71), both falling significantly below the study population mean. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is categorized as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score of -1.26, suggesting satisfaction with sleep. Self-esteem is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.66 indicating above-average self-worth, which often correlates with lower stress perception. Similarly, self-reported happiness is elevated (Z-score: 1.64). Behavioral patterns reveal a preference for exercising with others (Z-score: 1.23), which can be a stress-buffering social activity, and minimal substance usage. Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with limited internet usage outside of these activities.

Physiological data from the wearable device provide further insights. The participant's resting heart rate is relatively low (Z-score: -1.18), suggesting a potentially more relaxed baseline physiological state. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -0.16) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: -0.11), indicate a moderately stable circadian rhythm, though not exceptionally robust. The Mesor (average daily heart rate) is also below the population mean (Z-score: -1.1). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pronounced increase in heart rate during the typical waking hours, particularly in the morning (e.g., 6-7 AM Z-score: 4.41, 7-8 AM Z-score: 2.10) and a significant drop during the late night and early morning hours, consistent with a regular sleep-wake cycle. The amplitude of heart rate variation is close to the population average (Z-score: 0.04), indicating a typical diurnal fluctuation. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes, which is slightly below average for the study population (Z-score: -1.25), but the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score: 0.08) suggests consistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time of 23:35:15 is also relatively late, but its standard deviation indicates consistency.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant's profile suggests a low to median perceived stress level. The consistently low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, point towards positive psychological well-being. The good subjective sleep quality and consistent, albeit slightly short, sleep duration further support this. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is lower than average, and the heart rate patterns align with a regular daily cycle, with significant increases during active periods and decreases during rest. While sleep duration is somewhat reduced, it does not appear to be a significant source of distress, as indicated by the PSQI score. The positive correlations of some lifestyle factors with lower PSS scores (e.g., high self-esteem, happiness) and negative correlations of others with higher PSS scores (e.g., low depression, low anxiety) generally support a lower stress profile. Therefore, the participant is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population in terms of perceived stress.

45963,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral indicators that suggest elevated levels of stress and potential difficulties with emotional regulation. Notably, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 62.0 places the participant at a Z-score of 2.05, indicating a significantly higher level of chronic anxiety compared to the study population. This is further supported by a low self-reported happiness score (2.0) with a Z-score of -1.61, suggesting a tendency towards lower subjective well-being. While the participant's self-esteem score (30.0) is within a moderate range (Z-score of -1.15), the combination of high anxiety and low happiness points towards a vulnerable psychological profile. The depressive symptom score (CESD) is also elevated (22.0, Z-score of 0.9), although not classified as severely depressed, it contributes to the overall picture of psychological distress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates suboptimal sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 40 minutes, with a Z-score of -0.64, indicating less sleep than the average participant. More concerning is the high variability in sleep start times, reflected by a Z-score of 2.89 for the sleep start time standard deviation. This irregularity in sleep onset suggests a disrupted circadian rhythm and difficulty establishing consistent sleep hygiene. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, while not exceptionally high, suggests disturbed sleep, aligning with the wearable data. The participant also engages in moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week), which can be associated with increased stress levels and sleep disturbances. Notably, the participant reports not exercising alone (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-Score: -1.93), which is a behavior often linked to poorer stress management.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a more structured, albeit potentially stressed, cardiovascular profile. The Mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle) is elevated (81.81, Z-score of 1.07) relative to the population mean. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably low (4.2, Z-score of -2.13), suggesting a dampened physiological response to daily variations. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurring at 4:11 PM falls within typical daytime hours. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates significant deviations from the mesor during nocturnal hours, particularly between 3-4 AM (Z-score of 1.72) and 4-5 AM (Z-score of 1.05), suggesting physiological arousal or discomfort during these periods. This pattern of elevated nocturnal heart rate deviations, coupled with irregular sleep, could be indicative of the body's response to stress. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (0.16, Z-score of -2.06), signifying a lack of consistent daily patterns in cardiovascular activity, which can be a marker of stress or irregular lifestyle.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant's elevated anxiety, low happiness, suboptimal and irregular sleep patterns, lack of solitary exercise, and a physiologically stressed cardiovascular profile with low amplitude and interdaily stability strongly suggest a profile of elevated perceived stress. These factors, taken together, indicate that the participant is likely experiencing a higher burden of perceived stress than the average individual in the study population.

22138,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile that warrants detailed analysis, particularly in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate level of trait anxiety, as evidenced by an STAI-Trait score of 50, which falls within the upper range of typical scores and is associated with a positive correlation with perceived stress (r = 0.31). While depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale (score of 15), are not indicative of clinical depression and show a weak positive correlation with perceived stress (r = 0.28), the elevated anxiety proneness suggests a predisposition towards experiencing stress. Self-esteem is at a moderate level (score of 42), with a slightly negative correlation to perceived stress (r = -0.15), suggesting that higher self-esteem may be marginally associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective health satisfaction (score of 3.44) and general happiness (score of 3.0) are below the mid-point of their respective scales, with weak negative correlations to perceived stress, implying that lower satisfaction and happiness may be marginally linked to higher perceived stress. Sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, is rated as good (score of 5.0, Z-score of -0.8), suggesting subjective sleep is not a significant contributor to stress.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance usage, with wine or liquor consumption occurring 1-2 times per week (Z-score of 0.94), which has a negligible correlation with perceived stress (r = 0.03). Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all. Exercise habits are mixed; while there is no reported solitary exercise (Z-score of -1.93), the participant engages in exercise with others three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.23), which is associated with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress (r = -0.02). Daily recreational habits reveal a tendency towards passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.28) and moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85), both with weak positive correlations to perceived stress. Notably, reading for 16-30 minutes (Z-score of 1.3) demonstrates a stronger negative correlation with perceived stress (r = -0.21), indicating a potential stress-mitigating behavior.

Physiologically, the wearable data provides insights into daily rhythms and arousal. The interdaily stability of the participant's heart rate rhythm is moderately high (Value of 0.47, Z-score of 0.5), suggesting some regularity in daily cycles, though this metric has a slight negative correlation with perceived stress (r = -0.12). Conversely, intradaily variability is relatively low (Value of 0.47, Z-score of -0.53) and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress (r = 0.16), implying that less variability within the day might be associated with higher stress. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also moderate (Value of 0.3, Z-score of -0.19) with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress (r = -0.17). The mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly elevated (Value of 77.51, Z-score of 0.49), with a weak positive correlation to perceived stress (r = 0.06). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Value of 13.05, Z-score of 0.73), with a negative correlation to perceived stress (r = -0.17), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 4:20 PM. Resting heart rate is within a healthy range (Value of 60.6, Z-score of 0.29) with a moderate positive correlation to perceived stress (r = 0.14). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, the participant experiences significant deviations, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening hours, with a peak deviation of +17.25 at 6-7 PM (Z-score of 0.82), correlating with perceived stress (r = -0.13). There are also notable periods of reduced heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, deviation of -21.12, Z-score of -0.76), which is positively correlated with perceived stress (r = 0.19). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score of 0.43), which is within a healthy range and shows a negative correlation with perceived stress (r = -0.05). However, the median sleep start time is very late, at 1:15 AM, with a high standard deviation (121 minutes, Z-score of 0.83), positively correlated with perceived stress (r = 0.17), suggesting significant variability and lateness in sleep onset may be indicative of stress. There are no reported naps.

Considering the participant's elevated trait anxiety, a moderate level of self-esteem, and less than optimal daily happiness and health satisfaction, alongside a late and variable sleep schedule, there is evidence suggesting a potential for higher perceived stress. The positive correlations of trait anxiety and sleep start time variability with perceived stress are particularly noteworthy. While good subjective sleep quality and regular exercise with others are mitigating factors, the overall psychological profile and some behavioral and physiological patterns lean towards the higher end of perceived stress.

31439,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral indicators that warrant careful consideration in relation to their perceived stress levels. Self-reported measures reveal moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16.0, Z=0.28) and a notable tendency towards trait anxiety (STAI score of 49.0, Z=0.76). These scores, while not indicative of extreme pathology, suggest a baseline susceptibility to experiencing negative affect. Their self-esteem is within the average range (RSES score of 39.0, Z=0.11), and their trust in others is relatively low (Trust score of 2.5, Z=-1.42), which could potentially contribute to social or interpersonal stressors. Happiness levels are also slightly below average (Happy score of 3.0, Z=-0.53). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is considered to indicate disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 6.0, Z=-0.33), despite having a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 41 minutes, which falls below the generally recommended 7-9 hours. This suggests a discrepancy between the quantity of sleep and its perceived quality.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, aligning with higher than average usage within the population (Beer Z-score 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score 0.94). They report not using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity patterns show some engagement in exercise, with solo exercise and exercise with others occurring 1-2 times a week, though participation in sports is infrequent. Daily recreational habits are characterized by significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28) and moderate internet usage. Reading is also a notable activity for this participant, with a substantial time commitment (16-30 minutes, Z=1.3) correlating negatively with PSS score, suggesting a potential stress-buffering effect. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, a slightly above average engagement.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a relatively high resting heart rate (Value of 78.2, Z=2.38), indicating a potentially heightened baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a significantly elevated MESOR (Value of 91.39, Z=2.38), suggesting a higher average heart rate throughout the day compared to the population. While the intraday variability is low (Value of 0.37, Z=-1.24), suggesting a relatively stable pattern of heart rate fluctuations throughout the day, the acrophase (peak heart rate time) is reported at 4:05 PM. The hourly deviation from the mesor data indicates periods of higher cardiovascular activity during waking hours, particularly between 8 AM and 11 AM, and again in the early evening (5-6 PM). Conversely, the lowest deviations from the mesor occur during the late night and early morning hours, consistent with periods of rest. The negative correlation between median sleep duration and PSS score, albeit weak, suggests that shorter sleep durations might be associated with higher perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess the participant's overall perceived stress level, we consider the available data in relation to the population distribution of PSS scores. The population mean PSS is 21.61, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. This indicates that scores above 22.0 would place a participant in the top 50% of perceived stress.

Several self-report measures suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. The participant reports moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z=0.28) and a notable level of trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.76). Higher scores on these measures are generally correlated with increased perceived stress. While self-esteem is within the average range, and trust in others is low, these factors can contribute to stress. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI Z=-0.33), and actual sleep duration is below the recommended range (Median sleep duration Z=-0.61). Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep are well-established contributors to heightened perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant's moderate to high substance usage (Beer Z=1.01, Wine or Liquor Z=0.94) and higher than average TV/video watching (Z=1.28) might indicate coping mechanisms that are not necessarily stress-reducing in the long term. While reading shows a negative correlation with PSS score, the overall pattern of behaviors doesn't strongly point towards significant stress-mitigating activities.

Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate (Z=2.38) and MESOR (Z=2.38) suggest a state of heightened physiological arousal, which can be indicative of chronic stress. The observed hourly heart rate deviations also point to periods of increased cardiovascular activity during the day.

Considering these factors holistically, the presence of elevated anxiety, disturbed sleep, higher resting heart rate, and a significantly higher MESOR all suggest a predisposition towards experiencing higher levels of perceived stress. While some factors like self-esteem and reading habits are within a neutral to positive range, the convergence of several indicators points towards a perceived stress level that is likely to be in the upper half of the study population. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that this participant's PSS score would likely fall within the top 50% of the distribution.

46558,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators. Self-report measures suggest a relatively low dispositional anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.43) and a healthy level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of -0.45), both of which are indicative of psychological resilience. However, the participant reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score of 0.38), which, while not in a severe range, warrants consideration. Their reported happiness is notably elevated (Happy Z-score of 1.64), suggesting a positive affective state that may buffer against some stressors. Health satisfaction is also above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 0.8), indicating a generally positive perception of their physical well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle is characterized by a significant amount of sedentary activity, particularly video gaming (Video Games Z-score of 3.23) and general sedentary hobbies (Sedentary Hobby Z-score of 2.01). While they engage in watching TV/videos/movies for a moderate duration (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.28), and internet usage is also substantial (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85), these are offset by very low engagement in physical activity. Exercise, whether alone or with others, and participation in sports, are all reported as ""Not at all"" or ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" with corresponding strongly negative Z-scores, suggesting a significant lack of structured physical exertion. Socializing with friends, while reported as 2-3 hours, has a modest Z-score of 0.95, indicating it is above average for the population. Substance usage is generally low, with beer consumption being infrequent (1-2 times a month) and wine/liquor and recreational drugs not used at all.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as inferred from heart rate variability, shows some deviations from regularity. Interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.83) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 0.73) are elevated, suggesting a more structured, albeit potentially less flexible, daily rhythm compared to the population average. Intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.32) is only slightly above average. The mesor (average heart rate level) is close to the population mean (Z-score of -0.09), and the amplitude of daily heart rate fluctuations is also near the average (Z-score of -0.16). The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:17 PM. Significant hourly deviations from the mesor are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM show marked negative deviations), suggesting a potential disruption or adaptation in cardiovascular activity during this period. Notably, there are positive deviations in the late afternoon and evening, peaking between 7-8 PM and 5-6 PM, which is more aligned with typical diurnal patterns of arousal.

Sleep patterns are characterized by a near-average median sleep duration (7 hours 5 minutes, Z-score of -0.12) and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (58 minutes, Z-score of -0.98), suggesting consistency. However, the median sleep start time is quite late (01:14:30) with a moderate standard deviation (55 minutes), indicating a tendency towards delayed sleep onset. The absence of daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) is also noted. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is reported as good (PSQI Z-score of -0.8), which contrasts with the relatively late sleep start time, suggesting that despite a delayed schedule, the participant perceives their sleep as satisfactory.

The correlation analyses indicate a generally weak association between most measured variables and PSS scores. Of note are the negative correlations with reading habits (Score Correlation of -0.21) and general health satisfaction (Score Correlation of -0.08), suggesting that less engagement in reading and lower health satisfaction might be marginally associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, a slightly positive correlation is observed with the frequency of mid-morning heart rate deviations (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), which could reflect physiological responses to stress during these times, though these correlations are modest.

Considering the PSS population data, the mean PSS score is 21.61, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. This participant's elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64) and low anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score -0.43) and good self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score -0.45) suggest a predisposition towards lower perceived stress. Their good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) also supports this. However, the moderate CESD score (Z-score 0.38) and the significant time spent in sedentary activities, particularly video gaming, combined with very low physical activity, might contribute to stress. The physiological data, while not showing extreme deviations, indicates a consistent but late sleep schedule and some potentially stress-related heart rate patterns during early morning hours. Given the overall profile, especially the positive psychological markers and good subjective sleep, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing average to below-average perceived stress.

Self-esteem is also within a normative range, with a Z-score of -0.45, indicating a slightly lower than average but not critically low self-worth. While academic performance is strong, with a GPA of 3.38-3.44, subjective sleep quality is notably disturbed, as indicated by a PSQI Z-score of 1.05, classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This aligns with objective sleep data showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score: -0.42), which is shorter than average, and a sleep start time that averages around midnight (00:58:59).

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits high levels of internet usage (Z-score: 2.19), spending more than 4 hours daily online, and moderate television/video consumption (1-2 hours daily, Z-score: 1.28). These sedentary activities contrast with infrequent exercise, with solo exercise occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -0.43) and sports engagement being absent (Z-score: -1.09). Social engagement with friends occurs for approximately 31 minutes to an hour daily (Z-score: -0.62), which is below average, and recreational reading is notably absent (Z-score: -0.67). Substance use is generally low, with occasional beer consumption (1-2 times a month, Z-score: 0.3) and infrequent wine or liquor use. Health satisfaction is also relatively low (Z-score: -1.11).

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm analysis reveals some irregularities. Interdaily stability of heart rate is elevated (Z-score: 0.83), suggesting a more consistent daily rhythm. However, this is coupled with a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 0.81), indicating a strong tendency for heart rate patterns to repeat over consecutive days, which may reflect a rigid daily schedule. The mesor (average heart rate) is also elevated (Z-score: 0.74), as is the resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.79), suggesting a higher baseline physiological arousal. The hourly deviation from the mesor indicates periods of higher cardiovascular activity during daylight hours, peaking between 12 PM and 1 PM (Z-score: 1.22), and also between 11 AM and 12 PM (Z-score: 1.01). Notably, there is a significant dip in heart rate deviation in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM, Z-score: -1.13), potentially indicating a period of reduced physiological engagement before a subsequent increase in the evening. Sleep start time variability is also present, with a standard deviation of 89 minutes (Z-score: 0.14), suggesting some inconsistency in bedtime.

Considering the available evidence, the participant's self-reported Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the top 50% of the study population. While they report lower than average happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.11), and exhibit a pattern of high internet usage and low physical activity, these are not direct indicators of high PSS. The most salient indicators pointing towards elevated stress are the disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 1.05) and the elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.79) and mesor (Z-score: 0.74). These physiological indicators, combined with the moderate trait anxiety (STAI-Trait Z-score: 0.27), suggest a heightened state of physiological and psychological arousal that is consistent with higher perceived stress. Although their CES-D score indicates they are not depressed, and their GPA is strong, the sleep disturbances and elevated physiological arousal are strong signals for a potentially higher stress load. The negative correlations observed between some aspects of sedentary behavior (e.g., reading, video games) and PSS, while present, are not strong enough to outweigh the physiological and sleep-related evidence.

84011,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits several notable patterns across self-reported surveys and wearable-derived data. In terms of psychological traits, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 44.0 suggests a classification of ""anxious,"" with a Z-score of 0.27 indicating it is slightly above the population mean. This is further contextualized by a relatively low CES-D score of 6.0 (Z-score: -0.76), classified as ""Not depressed,"" and a Self-Esteem score of 33.0 (Z-Score: -0.73), which is below the population mean. Subjective happiness is reported at 4.0 (Z-Score: 0.55), suggesting a moderate level of self-reported happiness. Health satisfaction is also moderate at 5.0 (Z-score: 0.55). Trust in others is low, with a score of 2.83 and a Z-score of -0.78.

Lifestyle behaviors indicate a moderate engagement in physical activity, with ""Exercised with Others"" and ""Sports"" frequencies at ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-Scores: 1.23 and 1.58, respectively), while ""Exercised Alone"" is less frequent at ""1-2 times a month"" (Z-Score: -0.43). Substance usage is generally low, with ""Beer"" and ""Recreational Drugs"" reported as ""Not at all,"" and ""Wine or Liquor"" at ""1-2 times a month."" Daily recreation habits show a mixed pattern: ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" is engaged in for ""16-30 minutes"" (Z-Score: 0.01), ""Socializing with Friends"" is low at ""16-30 minutes"" (Z-Score: -1.41), and ""Reading"" and ""Video Games"" are not engaged in. Internet usage is moderate at ""31 minutes an hour"" (Z-Score: -0.49).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by heart rate variability, shows some irregularities. The ""Interdaily Stability"" is low at 0.35 (Z-Score: -0.49), suggesting a less consistent daily pattern of heart rate, while ""Intradaily Variability"" is high at 0.69 (Z-Score: 1.02), indicating more fluctuations within a day. The ""Mesor,"" representing the average heart rate over the day, is notably low at 63.1 (Z-Score: -1.48). The ""Resting Heart Rate"" is also low at 51.4 (Z-Score: -0.8). The ""Acrophase"" at ""3:54 PM"" indicates the peak heart rate typically occurs in the mid-afternoon.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. There are significant deviations during the late evening and nighttime hours, with the highest positive deviation observed between 8-9 PM (22.05, Z-score: 2.19) and significant negative deviations from 9-10 PM (-4.29, Z-score: -2.18) and 11 PM-12 AM (-4.15, Z-score: -1.13). Daytime hours generally show more positive deviations, particularly in the afternoon, such as 1-2 PM (14.3, Z-score: 0.99) and 5-6 PM (18.23, Z-score: 1.12), suggesting periods of increased cardiovascular activity. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of ""8 hours 28 minutes"" (Z-Score: 1.59), which is longer than average. The median sleep start time is early at ""00:03:10,"" with a standard deviation of 82 minutes.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The population PSS mean is 21.62, with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. This participant's data presents a complex picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, indicators such as relatively low CES-D scores, lower-than-average trust, and a below-average self-esteem score might suggest a predisposition to higher stress. Furthermore, the high intraday variability in heart rate and pronounced deviations in heart rate during evening and late-night hours, coupled with a very low mesor and resting heart rate, could indicate physiological dysregulation that may be associated with stress.

However, the participant also reports a longer-than-average sleep duration, which is generally considered a positive coping mechanism. Their moderate happiness and health satisfaction, along with significant engagement in structured exercise like sports, are also positive indicators. The STAI score classifying them as ""anxious"" does not necessarily translate to a high PSS score, as trait anxiety is a stable characteristic. The PSQI score indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" (though not explicitly a PSS correlate in this data) also complicates a clear interpretation.

Considering the overall data, the elevated anxiety score, coupled with physiological patterns suggestive of some circadian rhythm disruption and distinct evening heart rate elevations and subsequent dips, leans towards a potentially higher perceived stress. While there are protective factors such as sufficient sleep duration and exercise, the combination of anxiety and physiological variability points to a greater likelihood of experiencing stress at a level that would place them in the upper half of the distribution.

88008,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral traits that may inform their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score 0.7) and anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score 0.66), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem (RSES score of 33.0, Z-score -0.73) and overall health satisfaction (score of 3.33, Z-score -0.7) are relatively lower, suggesting a potential vulnerability to stress. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0, Z-score -0.8), which is typically associated with lower stress. However, this contrasts with objective sleep data revealing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes (Z-score -1.29), which is below the population average and potentially indicative of insufficient rest. The participant also engages in considerable physical activity, with exercise frequency being high in both solo and group settings, and participation in sports occurring three times a week or more (Z-scores of 1.07, 0.53, and 1.58 respectively). This high level of physical activity may serve as a buffer against stress. Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with a notable tendency to engage in reading (Z-score 1.3 for reading time), which can be a stress-reducing activity. Substance usage is reported as ""not at all"" across all categories, suggesting no significant stress-related substance use.

From a physiological and circadian rhythm perspective, the participant's wearable data present a mixed picture. The mesor of their heart rate (78.44 bpm, Z-score 0.61) is slightly elevated compared to the population average, suggesting a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm (15.36, Z-score 1.48) is notably high, indicating a significant fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, potentially reflecting a more pronounced physiological response to daily demands. The acrophase, occurring at 5:06 PM, suggests a peak in heart rate in the late afternoon/early evening. While the resting heart rate is within a normal range (55.1 bpm, Z-score -0.36), the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of substantial deviation from the mesor. Specifically, there are marked positive deviations (indicating higher than usual heart rate for that time of day) during the late evening (e.g., 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, with Z-scores of 1.39 and 1.44 respectively) and moderate positive deviations during the afternoon (e.g., 3-4 PM, 4-5 PM, with Z-scores of 0.73 and 1.19 respectively). Conversely, the deepest dips in heart rate occur during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, with Z-scores of -1.31 and -1.45 respectively), which, when combined with the shorter sleep duration, may indicate sleep disruption or difficulty achieving deep restorative sleep. The circadian rhythm stability metrics show high interdaily stability (0.52, Z-score 0.91), suggesting a regular daily pattern in heart rate, but also high intraday variability (0.3, Z-score -1.73), indicating significant fluctuations within a 24-hour period. This pattern of high amplitude and high intraday variability, coupled with shorter sleep durations, could be indicative of a physiological system that is highly reactive and potentially struggling with stress management, even with a stable daily structure.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the upper half of the study population distribution. The elevated scores in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) are strong indicators of higher perceived stress, as these are directly correlated with stress reactivity. While positive factors such as good subjective sleep quality, high engagement in exercise, and reading habits exist, they appear to be overshadowed by indicators of underlying psychological distress and physiological dysregulation. The objectively shorter sleep duration, coupled with notable fluctuations in heart rate during waking hours and potentially during sleep, suggests a physiological strain that is often associated with increased perceived stress. The high amplitude and high intraday variability in heart rate, despite good interdaily stability, point towards a system that experiences significant physiological arousal and potentially inefficient recovery, which can exacerbate stress responses. These converging factors, particularly the psychological measures and physiological reactivity, suggest that the participant experiences a level of stress that is likely above the median for this student population.

83566,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and physiological markers that warrant careful interpretation in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 2.47) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.05), both significantly above the study population's average. Conversely, self-esteem is reported as relatively low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score: -1.29), and self-reported happiness is also notably low (Z-score: -1.61). Health satisfaction and trust in others are within the average range of the study population. Behavioral data reveal a lack of substance usage and limited engagement in structured exercise, with no participation in sports or exercising with others, and infrequent solitary exercise (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits are also somewhat restricted, with minimal engagement in video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading. Napping behavior is absent, and while median sleep duration is ample (8 hours 8 minutes), the variability in sleep start time is relatively low.

Physiologically, this participant demonstrates a higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.34) and a pronounced mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint) for heart rate (Z-score: 1.49). This suggests a generally elevated physiological baseline. The hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor during the night and early morning hours, particularly between 3-4 AM and 5-6 AM, where negative deviations are most pronounced, indicating periods of lower-than-average heart rate during these times. Conversely, during daytime and early evening hours, there are positive deviations, suggesting periods of increased cardiovascular activity. The circadian rhythm metrics reveal a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.09) and intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.24), along with a strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 0.9), indicating a relatively regular circadian pattern in heart rate.

The correlation analysis between PSS scores and these metrics provides further context. While not always strong, several correlations are noteworthy. Higher CES-D and STAI scores correlate positively with PSS, aligning with expectations that depressive and anxious symptoms are associated with greater perceived stress. Lower self-esteem and lower self-reported happiness also show negative correlations with PSS, suggesting that individuals with lower well-being report higher stress. The PSS score shows a weak negative correlation with trust, indicating that higher trust might be associated with lower stress. Sleep duration, while subjectively adequate, has a weak negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that longer sleep might be associated with lower perceived stress. The physiological metrics show mixed correlations; a higher resting heart rate and mesor show weak positive correlations with PSS, indicating a potential link between elevated physiological arousal and perceived stress. Intradaily variability in heart rate shows a weak positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day might be associated with higher perceived stress.

Given the elevated levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, combined with lower self-esteem and happiness, this participant likely experiences a significant burden of psychological distress. The physiological markers, such as higher resting heart rate and mesor, further support a state of heightened physiological arousal. While some behavioral patterns, like limited substance use and adequate sleep duration, are potentially protective, the overall picture points towards a significant impact of perceived stress on psychological and physiological well-being.

Considering the participant's elevated scores in measures of depression (CES-D Z-score: 2.47) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.05), alongside notably low self-reported happiness (Z-score: -1.61) and relatively low self-esteem (Z-score: -1.29), these findings strongly suggest a profile consistent with higher levels of perceived stress. The population's PSS 50th percentile is 22.0, with a 75th percentile of 24.0. The strong positive correlations between PSS and both CES-D and STAI scores, with correlation coefficients of 0.28 and 0.31 respectively, indicate a clear association between these psychological distress indicators and the perceived stress measure. Furthermore, the higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.34) and mesor (Z-score: 1.49) suggest a baseline of heightened physiological arousal that can contribute to elevated perceived stress. The limited engagement in positive coping behaviors, such as socializing and active recreation, also contributes to a profile that is less buffered against stressors. Therefore, the evidence strongly indicates that this participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

87032,26.0,0.927461139896373,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological states, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data to interpret perceived stress levels in a university student population. The participant exhibits several indicators that warrant close examination in relation to their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. Notably, the participant reports a high level of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 28.0, which is 1.53 standard deviations above the mean, classifying them as ""Depressed."" Similarly, a PSQI score of 10.0 suggests significantly ""Disturbed Sleep,"" being 1.52 standard deviations above the mean. These findings are further corroborated by a relatively low self-esteem score (36.0), slightly below average (Z-score of -0.31), and lower than average reported happiness (Z-score of -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pattern of high sedentary activity, spending excessive time watching TV/videos (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.91), using the internet (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.19), listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), and engaging in reading for extended periods (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 2.28). This is in stark contrast to a complete lack of reported exercise or sports participation. Their sleep patterns, as measured by wearables, show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes (Z-score -0.58), which is below average, and a highly variable sleep start time (standard deviation of 145 minutes, Z-score 1.36), indicating a lack of regularity. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a higher than average resting heart rate (69.4 bpm, Z-score 1.34) and an elevated mesor (85.35, Z-score 1.56), suggesting a generally higher baseline cardiovascular arousal. The intradaily variability of their heart rate is also notably high (Z-score 1.44), suggesting increased physiological lability throughout the day.

The participant's PSS score needs to be assessed within the context of the population distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.6, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. Based on the available data, several indicators suggest a potentially elevated PSS score. The significant presence of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 1.53) and disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 1.52) are strongly associated with higher perceived stress. While trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.27) is not exceptionally high, it is above average. The positive correlations between CESD and PSS (0.28) and STAI and PSS (0.31) further support a link between these psychological states and perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant's physiological data points to a state of heightened arousal, with a higher resting heart rate and mesor, and significant intradaily variability in heart rate. These physiological markers, coupled with the pronounced psychological distress symptoms and poor sleep, indicate a profile consistent with higher levels of perceived stress. The lack of physical activity and the high engagement in passive leisure activities might also contribute to a less effective stress management strategy.

Considering the confluence of elevated depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, lower self-esteem and happiness, high sedentary behavior, disrupted sleep patterns, and physiological markers of heightened arousal, it is likely that this participant's PSS score falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively elevated perceived stress.

94641,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This analysis focuses on a participant's perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and integrates multimodal data including self-reported psychological and lifestyle variables, and Fitbit-derived physiological and behavioral metrics. The participant's overall PSS score is contextualized against the study population, where the mean PSS is 21.61, with a standard deviation of 3.68. The 25th percentile is 20.0, the median (50th percentile) is 22.0, and the 75th percentile is 24.0.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits elevated levels of psychological distress, as indicated by a high score on the CES-D scale (29.0, Z-score=1.63), suggesting a significant burden of depressive symptoms. Concurrently, trait anxiety is also elevated, with an STAI score of 54.0 (Z-score=1.25). This co-occurrence of depressive and anxious symptoms is often associated with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is notably poor, as reflected by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score=1.52), which falls into the 'Disturbed Sleep' classification and indicates clinically significant sleep difficulties. This subjective assessment is further supported by the wearable data, which shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score=-1.15) and a high standard deviation in sleep duration (168 minutes, Z-score=1.52), suggesting inconsistent and insufficient sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is around 00:30 AM, with a standard deviation of 89 minutes, further indicating irregularity in sleep timing.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in sedentary activities, with 'Video Games' (1-2 hours, Z-score=2.47) and 'Listening to Music' (more than 4 hours, Z-score=2.06) representing significant time commitments. Conversely, 'Socializing with Friends' is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-score=-2.2). Exercise habits are notably low, with no reported frequency for exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports. This lack of physical activity, coupled with high engagement in sedentary screen-based activities and social withdrawal, may contribute to elevated stress and psychological distress.

Physiologically, the participant displays a higher than average resting heart rate (70.3 bpm, Z-score=1.44). The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively regular rhythm with moderate interdaily stability (0.42, Z-score=0.09) but higher intradaily variability (0.47, Z-score=-0.53). The mesor, or average daily heart rate level, is elevated (83.09, Z-score=1.25). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, with deviations as low as -18.3) and a gradual increase throughout the morning, peaking in the afternoon. Notably, there is an elevated deviation from the mesor in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 1-3 PM, 5-6 PM), suggesting periods of heightened physiological arousal during these times. The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported as 4:49 PM, which aligns with the observed higher heart rate deviations in the afternoon. The significant positive correlation between CES-D and PSS (0.28) and STAI and PSS (0.31) further supports the link between psychological distress and perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data presents a compelling case for a high perceived stress level. The elevated scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) are strongly indicative of psychological distress, which is often a primary driver of high perceived stress. The consistently poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and objectively irregular and insufficient sleep duration further exacerbate stress. The lack of engagement in physical activity and limited social interaction are behavioral patterns that are frequently associated with increased stress levels. Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate and evidence of heightened arousal during specific periods of the day (late afternoon/early evening) could reflect a sustained stress response.

Considering the population statistics for the PSS, a score above 22.0 would place an individual in the top 50% of the distribution. Given the confluence of significant psychological distress, disrupted sleep, and sedentary lifestyle, it is highly probable that this participant experiences a perceived stress level that falls within the upper half of the study population. The positive correlations between key indicators of distress (CES-D, STAI) and perceived stress provide additional support for this conclusion.

82728,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally positive self-reported psychological and behavioral metrics, with some notable exceptions related to sleep and physiological regulation. Academically, the participant maintains a perfect GPA, indicating high performance, and reports generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.24) and anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23). Self-esteem is also within a healthy range (Z-score -0.17), and self-reported happiness is relatively low (Z-score -0.53), although not indicative of extreme distress. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Z-score -0.45), and while BMI is at the upper limit of a healthy range (25.6), it is not clinically elevated. Substance use is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is a strong positive indicator. Regarding exercise, the participant engages in solo exercise frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07), but less so with others, and does not participate in sports. Daily recreational activities are characterized by moderate engagement with the internet and socializing, with limited time spent on video games, watching TV/movies, listening to music, or reading.

The participant's sleep patterns, as indicated by the PSQI score of 7.0, suggest disturbed sleep (Z-score 0.13), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 59 minutes (Z-score -0.25), which is slightly below the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration (92 minutes, Z-score -0.21) suggests moderate consistency. The median sleep start time is very late, at 1:05 AM, with a substantial standard deviation of 93 minutes (Z-score 0.21), indicating a highly variable and late sleep schedule.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as suggested by a moderate interdaily stability (0.5, Z-score 0.75) and lower than average intradaily variability (0.47, Z-score -0.53), implying a degree of predictability in daily activity patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is higher than average (0.45, Z-score 1.06), further supporting circadian regularity. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle, is slightly elevated (76.53, Z-score 0.35), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (15.56, Z-score 1.54), suggesting significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the rhythm, occurs late in the afternoon (4:54 PM). The resting heart rate is within the healthy range (60.2, Z-score 0.24). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. Heart rate is significantly lower than the Mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 3 AM and 5 AM (Z-scores ranging from -0.26 to -0.29). Conversely, heart rate is elevated above the Mesor during the late afternoon and evening, with peak deviations observed between 5 PM and 7 PM (Z-scores of 2.47 and 0.65, respectively), and also in the early afternoon between 1 PM and 4 PM (Z-scores up to 1.27). This pattern suggests a physiological response characterized by a dip in heart rate during the typical sleep period and heightened cardiovascular activity during the late afternoon and evening.

Considering the combined data, the participant's relatively low scores on self-reported depression and anxiety, coupled with a perfect GPA and healthy substance use patterns, point towards a stable psychological state. However, the disturbed sleep quality, late and variable sleep schedule, and the pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate, with significant elevations during the evening, are potential indicators of stress or lifestyle factors that could be impacting physiological regulation. The strong positive correlations with PSS scores for several self-report measures of negative affect (CES-D and STAI) and positive correlations with metrics associated with sleep disruption (Intradaily Variability, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation) suggest these factors might contribute to perceived stress. Conversely, positive academic performance and high levels of self-esteem correlate negatively with PSS, which would tend to lower the score. The high amplitude of the circadian rhythm and the significant deviations from the Mesor during the evening hours, despite a generally stable circadian structure, warrant further consideration as potential physiological correlates of stress, especially given the positive correlation of Intradaily Variability with PSS.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population. While there are indicators that could contribute to elevated stress, such as disturbed sleep quality and a late, variable sleep schedule, and a high circadian amplitude suggesting physiological fluctuation, these are not overwhelmingly negative when viewed in conjunction with other data. The participant demonstrates excellent academic performance (4.0 GPA), low self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.24), and low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23). Self-esteem is also within a healthy range, and substance usage is absent. The positive correlation between certain measures of sleep disturbance and PSS, as well as the physiological stress indicators like high circadian amplitude and evening heart rate elevation, do suggest some potential for stress. However, the overwhelming presence of positive protective factors, particularly in the psychological and academic domains, are strong counterpoints to a high PSS score. The population PSS mean is 21.61, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. Given the overall profile of high functioning and low negative affect on key psychological measures, it is more probable that the participant's perceived stress levels are not in the top tier of the distribution.

Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), aligning with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 38 minutes, which is slightly above average for the population (Z-score: 0.56).

Physiological data derived from wearable devices offer a more objective perspective on the participant's daily functioning. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals an interdaily stability of 0.32 (Z-score: -0.74), indicating a somewhat less regular daily pattern. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated at 0.59 (Z-score: 0.32), suggesting a moderate degree of fluctuation within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is high at 0.42 (Z-score: 0.81), indicating a relatively strong day-to-day predictability in heart rate patterns. The mesor (average daily heart rate level) is slightly below average (Mesor Z-score: -0.49), as is the amplitude (Mesor Z-score: -0.44), suggesting less pronounced daily fluctuations in heart rate compared to the population average. The acrophase, representing the peak heart rate time, occurs at 4:14 PM. The resting heart rate is close to the population average (RHR Z-score: -0.04). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, there is a significant positive deviation during the late afternoon and early evening, with peak positive deviations occurring between 4-5 PM (Z-score: 2.4) and 3-4 PM (Z-score: 1.48). A smaller, but still notable, peak in positive deviation is observed between 8-9 PM (Z-score: 0.99). Conversely, there are significant negative deviations during the early morning hours, particularly between 1-5 AM, indicating periods of lower cardiovascular activity than average during sleep.

Given the available data, the participant's perceived stress level (PSS) is likely to fall within the **bottom 50th percentile** of the study population. While the participant reports some anxiety and below-average happiness, these are not substantially elevated. Furthermore, their high self-esteem and engagement in regular physical activity are known protective factors against stress. The disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, is a potential stressor, but their median sleep duration is slightly longer than average, suggesting this may not be severely impacting their overall recovery. The physiological data does not reveal widespread markers of chronic stress; the elevated heart rate deviations in the late afternoon/early evening could reflect daily activities or temporary physiological responses rather than chronic hyperarousal. The negative correlations with PSS for some key indicators like self-esteem, happiness, and low internet usage further support a lower perceived stress score.

The participant exhibits a notable combination of psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant detailed examination in relation to perceived stress. In terms of self-reported psychological states, the participant reports a low CES-D score (-0.86 Z-score), indicating a low burden of depressive symptoms, and a moderate STAI-Trait score (-0.23 Z-score), suggesting relatively low chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is reported at a moderately high level (0.68 Z-score), which is generally associated with better psychological well-being. However, there is a notably high self-reported happiness score (1.64 Z-score), which might suggest a potentially inflated positive affect or a coping mechanism. Despite this high happiness score, the participant reports generally low satisfaction with their physical health (1.3 Z-score), which, while not exceptionally low, deviates from the high happiness level and warrants consideration. The participant also reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine or Liquor usage are three times a week or more, with Z-scores of 1.72 and 1.68 respectively), while abstaining from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are mixed: they exercise alone and with others frequently (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23), but do not participate in sports (Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreation habits are characterized by limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with significant time spent listening to music and socializing with friends. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies, and spending 2-3 hours socializing with friends.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals several key patterns. The participant exhibits a low mesor (mean heart rate) of 61.84 (Z-score of -1.65) and a low resting heart rate of 48.3 (Z-score of -1.17), indicative of a potentially well-trained cardiovascular system or a generally low physiological arousal state at rest. The circadian rhythm metrics suggest a relatively low degree of regularity and structure. Specifically, interdaily stability is low (-0.99 Z-score), indicating a lack of consistency in daily activity patterns, and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also notably low (-1.37 Z-score), further supporting the idea of disrupted daily rhythms. Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.46 Z-score), suggesting more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a pronounced dip during late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am, 1-2 am, 2-3 am, 3-4 am, 4-5 am, 5-6 am show negative deviations from the mesor, with the most pronounced at -21.43 Z-score for 4-5 am), suggesting a period of low cardiovascular activity, likely sleep. Conversely, the participant experiences significant peaks in heart rate deviations from the mesor during the late morning and afternoon/early evening, particularly between 10-11 am (26.18 Z-score), 11 am-12 pm (24.15 Z-score), 12-1 pm (27.85 Z-score), and 5-6 pm (32.46 Z-score). These periods of elevated cardiovascular activity during waking hours could reflect times of stress, intense focus, or physical exertion. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 58 minutes (Z-score of -0.27), which is slightly below average for the study population, and a relatively high standard deviation in sleep duration (0.77 Z-score), suggesting variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is late (23:38:55) with a high standard deviation (1.55 Z-score), indicating inconsistent sleep timing.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess the participant's PSS score relative to the study population, we consider the available evidence for both low and high perceived stress.

**Evidence for Low/Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several indicators typically associated with lower perceived stress. Their low CES-D score suggests a minimal presence of depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score indicates low chronic anxiety. This generally positive psychological profile could contribute to lower overall perceived stress. Furthermore, their relatively high GPA, consistent engagement in exercising, and active socializing with friends are behavioral patterns that can serve as protective factors against stress. The low resting heart rate and mesor suggest a generally calm physiological state.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, there are several indicators suggesting potentially elevated perceived stress. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), with a median sleep duration slightly below the population average and significant variability in both sleep duration and start time. This disruption in sleep is a well-established correlate of increased stress. While self-esteem is moderate to high, the high reported happiness score (1.64 Z-score) could be an outlier or a superficial presentation, potentially masking underlying distress. The frequent consumption of alcohol (beer and wine/liquor three times a week or more) is another behavior that can be used as a coping mechanism for stress. Physiologically, the intradaily variability in heart rate is somewhat elevated, and the significant positive deviations from the mesor during late morning and early afternoon hours point to periods of heightened cardiovascular arousal that may correlate with stressful experiences or demanding periods of the day. The low interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours suggest a disorganized daily routine, which can be a source of stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant presents with some indicators of lower perceived stress, such as low depressive symptoms and anxiety, the constellation of disturbed sleep, frequent alcohol consumption, and periods of high physiological arousal during the day are strong indicators of potential elevated stress. The inconsistent sleep patterns and disorganization in daily rhythms, coupled with the use of alcohol as a reported habit, suggest that the participant may be experiencing and attempting to manage significant stress. The high reported happiness score could be a sign of positive affect but might also indicate a potential disconnect from the underlying stress experienced. The Z-scores for sleep duration standard deviation and sleep start time standard deviation are notably positive, indicating a greater variability than the average participant, which directly relates to stress. Considering these factors, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing a level of perceived stress that places them in the higher half of the study population.

27306,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a relatively low subjective report of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.76) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.43). They also report good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI Z-score of -1.26. Despite these positive indicators, their self-esteem score is notably high (Z-score of 1.66), and they report high levels of health satisfaction (Z-score of 1.8). Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is infrequent, falling below the 1-2 times a month threshold and exhibiting negative Z-scores, suggesting lower than average usage. In terms of daily activities, the participant engages in regular exercise, with both solo and group exercise frequencies reported as ""three times a week or more,"" reflected in positive Z-scores for these metrics. Notably, sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, and listening to music are reportedly not engaged in or are performed for very limited durations, as indicated by significantly negative Z-scores. Conversely, internet usage is minimal (Z-score of -1.83). Socializing with friends occurs for a duration of 31 minutes to an hour, which, while not exceptionally high, is within a common range. Reading and other sedentary hobbies are reported as not being engaged in.

From a physiological perspective, the participant exhibits a lower than average Mesor (circadian rhythm's daily average heart rate, Z-score of -1.49) and a lower than average resting heart rate (Z-score of -1.42). This suggests a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.32), indicating some fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. However, the interdaily stability (Z-activity pattern consistency across days, Z-score of -0.24) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of -0.36) are slightly below average, suggesting some minor irregularities in the daily rhythm's consistency. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of deviation from the mesor. During the late night and early morning hours (approximately 12 AM to 6 AM), there are significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate during this period, consistent with sleep. A notable sharp increase in heart rate deviation occurs between 7 AM and 8 AM (Z-score of 5.17), followed by elevated levels through the morning and into the afternoon. A pronounced peak in heart rate deviation is observed between 4 PM and 5 PM (Z-score of 7.8), followed by a rapid decline into the evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes, which is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.6), and a median sleep start time close to midnight (23:55:27). The standard deviations for both sleep duration and sleep start time are within a typical range, suggesting some consistency in sleep timing. The absence of daily naps (Z-score of 0.04) is also noted.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data presents a mixed picture in relation to perceived stress. On one hand, their self-reported mental health indicators, such as low depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scores, and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI), along with low substance usage and consistent engagement in exercise, are generally associated with lower levels of perceived stress. Their higher than average self-esteem and health satisfaction could also contribute to a buffer against stress. However, the slightly below average sleep duration and some minor irregularities in circadian rhythm consistency (lower interdaily stability and autocorrelation) could indicate underlying challenges.

The absence of a direct PSS score makes a definitive placement challenging. However, considering the available correlates, the participant's profile leans towards the lower to middle range of perceived stress. The positive self-reported psychological well-being measures, consistent engagement in healthy behaviors like exercise, and low substance use are strong indicators of resilience and lower stress levels. While sleep duration is slightly reduced, it does not appear to be severely disturbed, and the variability in heart rate is substantial during waking hours, with a prominent peak in the late afternoon. The correlations provided with PSS are generally low and often negative for metrics associated with positive well-being and healthy habits (e.g., Trust, Happy, Health Satisfaction, Exercised with Others, Reading), suggesting that higher scores in these areas are associated with lower PSS. Conversely, metrics with positive correlations for PSS are not particularly strong or defining in this profile (e.g., CESD, STAI, Intradaily Variability, Resting Heart Rate). Therefore, based on the holistic analysis of the available multimodal data, the participant is more likely to fall within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population regarding their Perceived Stress Scale score.

46365,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This analysis integrates self-reported psychological and behavioral data with physiological and behavioral metrics derived from wearable device data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the participant's perceived stress levels during an academic semester. The participant reported average levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 12.0, Z-score -0.14) and exhibited a positive self-esteem score (40.0, Z-Score 0.26), which aligns with high academic achievement (GPA of 4.0). While trait anxiety levels are slightly elevated (STAI score of 45.0, Z-score 0.37), they are not classified as highly anxious within the study population. Subjective health satisfaction is low (2.33, Z-score -1.45), contrasting with a normal Body Mass Index (24.41). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is reported as good (5.0, Z-Score -0.8), with median sleep duration falling within a healthy range (7 hours 16 minutes, Z-Score 0.11). However, sleep onset is relatively late (median 01:34:00, Z-Score -0.47), and there is a moderate tendency for naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-Score 1.09).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high levels of internet usage (Z-Score 2.19) and socializing with friends (Z-Score 2.53), which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, engagement in activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading is minimal or non-existent. Substance usage, particularly beer consumption, is notably high (Three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.72), while other substance use is infrequent. Physical activity levels show moderate engagement in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-Score 0.91) but less frequent solo exercise or exercise with others.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a resting heart rate within the normal range (55.8, Z-Score -0.28). Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively regular daily pattern with a mesor slightly above average (77.13, Z-Score 0.43) and an amplitude within the average range (10.86, Z-Score 0.03). The acrophase, or peak time, for heart rate is around 6:09 PM. However, there are notable deviations in heart rate from the mesor during certain periods of the day. Specifically, a significant elevation in heart rate is observed in the late evening and early morning hours (11 PM - 1 AM, with Z-scores of 1.79 and 1.73 respectively for the 11 PM-12 AM and 12-1 AM intervals), suggesting potential physiological arousal or disruption during these times. Conversely, during the late night and early morning hours (4 AM - 8 AM), heart rate deviations are significantly negative, indicating periods of unusually low cardiovascular activity. The wearable data on activity regularity shows low interdaily stability (0.3, Z-Score -0.9) and high intradaily variability (0.36, Z-Score -1.31), suggesting a less structured daily routine and potentially less consistent physical activity patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (-1.37 Z-score), further indicating a disruption in the daily rhythm.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score places them in the top half of the study population. Evidence for elevated perceived stress is observed in several areas. The high frequency of beer consumption, coupled with extensive internet usage and frequent socializing with friends, all of which show positive correlations with perceived stress, suggests potential behavioral coping mechanisms or triggers for stress. The significant physiological arousal indicated by elevated heart rate deviations during late evening and early morning hours, despite generally good reported sleep quality, could reflect underlying stress impacting physiological regulation. Furthermore, the low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability in heart rate and activity patterns suggest a lack of structured daily routines, which can be a contributor to higher perceived stress. While the participant reports good subjective sleep quality and high academic achievement, these factors do not negate the evidence from behavioral and physiological data that points towards a higher stress load. The positive correlation between trait anxiety and perceived stress, although moderate, further supports this conclusion.

23287,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a notably low resting heart rate (Mesor: 57.82, Z-Score: -2.2), which is significantly below the population average. This is accompanied by a low amplitude of heart rate variation (Amplitude: 12.52, Z-Score: 0.56), suggesting a relatively stable physiological state throughout the day. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a generally regular sleep-wake cycle, with moderate interdaily stability (0.45, Z-Score: 0.33) and intradaily variability (0.57, Z-Score: 0.17). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed at 5:03 PM, aligning with typical diurnal patterns. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals deviations from the mesor. Specifically, there are pronounced elevations in heart rate during the late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 9-10 PM (2.09 Z-Score) and 10-11 PM (2.37 Z-Score). Conversely, heart rate appears to be suppressed during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), suggesting a potential disruption or blunting of physiological response during these periods.

Regarding self-reported psychological and behavioral data, the participant reports no substance usage, which is consistent with lower Z-scores for these activities. Exercise habits indicate moderate engagement, with exercising alone 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 0.32) and exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-Score: 1.23). However, engagement in sports is less frequent (Less than 1-2 times a month, Z-Score: -0.42). Daily recreational habits show a high level of internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-Score: 1.52) and relatively limited social interaction with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-Score: -1.41). Other sedentary habits such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, and dedicated sedentary hobbies are reported as ""Do not do,"" which aligns with lower Z-scores for these activities. Reading time is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: 0.32).

The participant's subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score (3.0, Z-Score: -1.72), is classified as ""Good Sleep,"" suggesting low subjective sleep disturbance. This aligns with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 23 minutes (Z-Score: 1.49), which is above average. However, the sleep start time is consistently around 1 AM (Median Sleep Start Time: 00:56:14), with a standard deviation of 76 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The mean daily naps (0.25, Z-Score: 2.07) are elevated, potentially reflecting attempts to compensate for sleep or other factors.

Self-reported measures of psychological well-being are generally positive. The participant reports not being depressed (CESD Score: 6.0, Z-Score: -0.76) and not being anxious (STAI Score: 37.0, Z-Score: -0.43). Self-esteem is average (RSES Score: 38.0, Z-Score: -0.03), and happiness levels are slightly below average (Current Happiness: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53). Health satisfaction is notably high (Score: 6.56, Z-Score: 1.71), which is a strong positive indicator. Trust in others is above average (Score: 3.67, Z-Score: 0.83).

In terms of Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) interpretation, the available data suggests a profile consistent with the lower half of the distribution. While there are some indicators of potential stress, such as elevated heart rate deviations during the late evening, and higher than average internet usage alongside less frequent socializing, these are counterbalanced by several protective factors. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality, above-average sleep duration, low levels of depression and anxiety, and high health satisfaction. The low resting heart rate and Mesor also suggest a generally calm physiological baseline. The correlations provided, while not definitive, generally do not show strong positive associations with PSS that would strongly indicate elevated stress. For instance, CESD and STAI, which are often correlated with stress, show weak positive correlations (0.28 and 0.31 respectively) and are within non-clinical ranges. The strong negative correlation for reading time (-0.21) and positive correlation for internet usage (0.11) suggest that while one beneficial habit is practiced minimally, another potentially less beneficial habit is more prevalent, but these are not overwhelmingly indicative of high stress. Considering the totality of the evidence, particularly the self-reported mental well-being and sleep quality, the participant's perceived stress is likely within the average or lower range.

28247,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several notable patterns across self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data, all assessed in relation to their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. In terms of psychological well-being, the participant reports elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 29.0, Z-score of 1.63) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 61.0, Z-score of 1.95), both of which place them in the upper range of the study population. These findings are consistent with a positive correlation between these measures and perceived stress. Conversely, the participant reports higher than average self-esteem (Z-score of -1.01) and trust (Z-score of -1.1), which show weak negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting these protective factors may be present despite higher reported distress. Happiness is reported at an average level (Z-score of 0.55) with a slight negative correlation to perceived stress. Health satisfaction and Body Mass Index are within average ranges, with minimal correlations to stress levels.

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a relatively sedentary lifestyle, with significantly low frequencies of exercising alone (Z-score of -1.18), exercising with others (Z-score of -1.58), and participating in sports (Z-score of -1.09). They also engage in limited daily recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of -1.25), video games (Z-score of -0.56), and reading (Z-score of 0.32, with a negative correlation to PSS). Notably, this participant dedicates substantial time to listening to music (Z-score of 2.06) and socializing with friends (Z-score of 2.53), both of which are significantly higher than the study population average and exhibit weak positive correlations with perceived stress. Internet usage is exceptionally low (Z-score of -1.83). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported at low to average frequencies.

From a wearable data perspective, the participant's sleep patterns are characterized by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes (Z-score of -0.94), which is below the population average, and a highly variable sleep start time (standard deviation of 208 minutes, Z-score of 2.74). This irregularity in sleep timing is significantly higher than the norm and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress. The circadian rhythm metrics reveal a low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.48), suggesting a lack of consistent daily patterning in heart rate, and a high intradaily variability (Z-score of 1.51), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is also notably low (Z-score of -1.61), potentially reflecting a blunted physiological response to daily cycles. The Mesor (average heart rate) is within the population average. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates periods of higher-than-average heart rate during the early morning hours (3-7 AM) and moderate elevations throughout the workday (8-10 AM, 5-10 PM). Conversely, there are notable decreases in heart rate during the late morning (11 AM-12 PM) and early afternoon (2-5 PM). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian rhythm, is recorded at 4:08 PM. The resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.48) and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data suggests a PSS score that likely falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively elevated perceived stress. Several factors contribute to this assessment. The participant reports significant levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 1.63) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.95), both of which are known correlates of heightened stress and fall in the upper range of the study population. While self-esteem and trust are higher than average, their weak negative correlations do not strongly counteract the impact of the psychological distress measures.

Behaviorally, the marked lack of physical activity and exercise, coupled with a highly irregular sleep schedule (high sleep start time variability Z-score 2.74) and below-average sleep duration, are all indicators often associated with increased stress. The high intradaily variability of heart rate (Z-score 1.51) and low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.48) further suggest physiological dysregulation that can be indicative of stress. The consistent elevation in heart rate during certain periods of the day, particularly in the morning and evening, could reflect ongoing physiological arousal.

While the participant engages in significant social interaction and listening to music, these positive coping mechanisms, while potentially beneficial in moderation, appear alongside a constellation of other stress-related indicators. The overall pattern points towards a participant experiencing a substantial burden of psychological distress and physiological irregularity, which strongly suggests a PSS score in the upper half of the distribution.

72806,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a number of behavioral and physiological patterns that offer insight into their perceived stress levels. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score of -0.86) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score of -0.82). Self-esteem is reported at a high level (Score of 39.0, Z-score of 0.11), within the normal range. Subjective health satisfaction is moderate (Score of 3.33, Z-score of -0.7). Daily activities suggest a preference for passive leisure, with limited engagement in sports or exercise (Frequency of 'Not at all' for Sports, Z-score of -1.09) and moderate internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score of -1.16). Substance usage is generally low, with beer consumed less than 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month.

Wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle) is 72.0 bpm (Z-score of -0.27), which is slightly below the population average. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 12.52 bpm (Z-score of 0.56), indicating a moderate variation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed around 4:00 PM. Notably, the hourly deviations from the Mesor show a significant elevation in heart rate during the 6-7 PM hour (25.34, Z-score of 2.22), suggesting a period of heightened physiological arousal during this time, which is considerably higher than other hourly deviations. Conversely, the late-night and early-morning hours (12 AM to 6 AM) exhibit considerable negative deviations from the Mesor, consistent with a period of rest. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score of 0.47), which is slightly longer than the population average, with a low standard deviation for sleep duration (85 minutes, Z-score of -0.36). The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:29:45), with a low standard deviation for sleep start time (68 minutes, Z-score of -0.32).

Correlations with PSS scores, while exploratory, provide additional context. Lower self-reported happiness correlates with higher PSS scores (r = -0.19), and more time spent reading (r = -0.21) and less time spent on video games (r = -0.14) are also weakly associated with higher PSS. Higher intradaily variability in heart rate (r = 0.16) and less time spent exercising alone (r = 0.04) show a slight positive correlation with PSS. The most notable correlations in this dataset are the negative association between higher PSS scores and increased consumption of recreational drugs (r = 0.04) and non-prescribed drugs (r = 0.04), though these correlations are very weak.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data suggests a profile that leans towards the lower half of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) distribution. Self-reported measures of depression (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) are notably low, placing them in the bottom percentiles of the study population for these constructs. Self-esteem is within the average range. Subjective health satisfaction is also moderate, and sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score below the population mean. While the participant engages in less structured activities like watching TV and internet usage, they do not report significant substance abuse.

The physiological data from the wearable further supports a generally stable state. The Mesor and resting heart rate are within the average range, and the circadian rhythm, while showing a notable peak in heart rate deviation during the early evening, does not indicate widespread or extreme physiological dysregulation. Sleep duration is slightly longer than average, suggesting sufficient rest.

Although some correlations with PSS exist, such as a weak association with less time spent reading and more time spent on video games, these do not present a compelling case for elevated stress. The absence of high scores in key psychological distress indicators (depression, anxiety) and the presence of positive indicators like good sleep quality and adequate self-esteem strongly suggest that the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

Self-esteem is above average (z-score of 0.68), and trust in others is also slightly elevated (z-score of 0.18), aligning with lower perceived stress. Happiness levels are slightly below average (z-score of -0.53). Behavioral habits are characterized by minimal substance usage and limited engagement in exercise, with the exception of a notable increase in video gaming time (z-score of 2.47) and moderate internet, music listening, and sedentary hobby engagement.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a higher-than-average resting heart rate (z-score of 0.86), which, when considered with the circadian rhythm data, reveals a somewhat less regular pattern. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is slightly elevated (z-score of 0.42), suggesting some degree of day-to-day regularity, yet the Intradaily Variability is also elevated (z-score of 0.53), indicating greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is also higher than the population average (z-score of 0.61). The temporal pattern of heart rate deviation from the Mesor shows a clear trend of increased cardiovascular activity during waking hours, with the highest positive deviations observed in the late morning and early evening (e.g., 8-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM). Notably, there is a significant dip in heart rate deviation during the late night and early morning hours, consistent with sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes, which is slightly shorter than average (z-score of -0.47), and the sleep start time is also later than average, initiating around 1:30 AM, with moderate variability. The PSQI score of 5.0 suggests good subjective sleep quality, although a score above 5 can sometimes indicate disturbance.

Given the participant's self-reported characteristics and behavioral patterns, evidence points towards a generally lower to average perceived stress level. The absence of elevated depressive symptoms and moderate anxiety, coupled with above-average self-esteem and trust, are indicative of resilience. While certain behavioral patterns, such as extensive video gaming, and physiological metrics like a higher resting heart rate and increased intradaily heart rate variability, might suggest areas of potential stress or arousal, they do not present as overwhelmingly detrimental in isolation. The sleep duration, while slightly reduced, is within a range that does not strongly suggest severe sleep deprivation. Crucially, the correlations between these metrics and the PSS score are predominantly weak and often negative, implying that these factors are not strongly predictive of higher perceived stress for this participant. Therefore, the overall picture suggests the participant likely falls within the bottom half of the study population regarding perceived stress.

67918,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several indicators potentially influencing their perceived stress levels. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D, Z-score = -0.86) and is classified as ""not anxious"" on the STAI trait scale (Z-score = -0.62). This suggests a relatively stable psychological baseline, with a low propensity for trait anxiety and a low frequency of depressive symptoms. Conversely, self-esteem is notably high (SelfEsteem, Z-Score = 1.38), indicating a strong sense of self-worth. Health satisfaction is also reported to be high (Health Satisfaction, Z-score = 1.22), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical well-being. Trust in others is slightly above average (Trust, Z-Score = 0.18), and self-reported happiness is also slightly lower than the average participant (Happy, Z-Score = -0.53), though not significantly so.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates consistent and healthy lifestyle choices. They report no substance usage (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all with negative Z-scores). Physical activity levels are moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a month both alone and with others, and no participation in sports. Daily recreation habits indicate a balanced approach, with moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and listening to music, alongside significant time dedicated to socializing with friends (1-2 hours) and some dedicated reading time (15 minutes). Sedentary hobbies are minimal. Sleep patterns appear to be a strength, with a very good PSQI score (Z-Score = -1.72) indicating high subjective sleep quality. Fitbit data corroborates this with a longer than average median sleep duration (Z-Score = 1.88) and a stable sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation, Z-Score = -0.6), suggesting a regular sleep schedule.

Physiologically, circadian rhythm metrics reveal a highly regular daily pattern. The participant exhibits high Interdaily Stability (Z-Score = 1.49) and a low Intradaily Variability (Z-Score = -1.24), indicating a structured and predictable daily heart rate rhythm. This is further supported by a high Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-Score = 1.65), suggesting strong day-to-day consistency in their cardiovascular activity. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is above average (Z-Score = 1.0), and the Amplitude, representing the extent of daily fluctuation, is also significantly higher than average (Z-Score = 1.59). This suggests a more pronounced daily rhythm in heart rate. The acrophase, indicating the peak in the circadian cycle, occurs in the late afternoon (3:42 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal elevated cardiovascular activity during the mid-afternoon hours (1-3 PM show positive deviations, with the highest at 2-3 PM, Z-score = 2.34). Conversely, late night and early morning hours (12-5 AM) show significant negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate during these periods, consistent with a typical sleep cycle. The resting heart rate is also slightly above average (Z-Score = 0.55).

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine if the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top or bottom half of the study population, a holistic analysis of the provided data is undertaken. The population's mean PSS score is 21.62, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. Therefore, a score of 22.0 or lower indicates the bottom 50%, while a score above 22.0 indicates the top 50%.

Evidence for a **low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile)** is supported by several factors. The participant reports low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.62) and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.86), which are often correlated with higher perceived stress. Their high self-esteem (Z-Score = 1.38) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-Score = -1.72) are also protective factors against stress. Furthermore, the objective sleep data indicates longer than average sleep duration (Z-Score = 1.88) and stable sleep start times, suggesting a well-regulated sleep schedule, which is generally associated with lower stress. The highly regular and stable circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-Score = 1.49, Intradaily Variability Z-Score = -1.24, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-Score = 1.65) suggests effective physiological regulation. While their happiness is slightly below average (Z-Score = -0.53), it does not strongly indicate high stress.

Evidence for a **high PSS score (top 50th percentile)** is less pronounced. The slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-Score = 0.55) and higher than average Mesor (Z-Score = 1.0) and Amplitude (Z-Score = 1.59) in their heart rate variability could suggest underlying physiological arousal, but these are within a range that doesn't definitively point to high stress without other corroborating factors. The elevated heart rate during specific afternoon hours (e.g., 2-3 PM, Z-score = 2.34) could indicate moments of heightened physiological response, but the overall pattern of low negative psychological indicators and positive sleep metrics mitigates this.

**Holistic Analysis:** The preponderance of evidence points towards a participant with generally positive psychological and physiological markers that would likely contribute to lower perceived stress. The absence of significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with high self-esteem, good sleep quality and quantity, and a highly regular circadian rhythm, strongly suggests a participant who is managing their stress effectively. While some physiological metrics like higher Mesor and Amplitude in heart rate variability might hint at a capacity for physiological response, they do not, in isolation, indicate a high stress burden, especially when contrasted with the robust protective psychological and behavioral factors. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

34467,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret perceived stress levels in a university student population. The participant presents with generally positive psychological and behavioral indicators, although certain aspects warrant attention. Specifically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.82), along with high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.26). This is further supported by high self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64) and a strong sense of trust in others (Trust Z-score: 0.18). Health satisfaction is moderately high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.8).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a commitment to physical activity, exercising with others three times a week or more (Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23), which is above the population average. While individual exercise frequency is moderate (Exercised Alone Z-score: 0.32), and sports engagement is low (Sports Z-score: -1.09), the overall pattern suggests an active lifestyle. Substance usage is notably absent across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all have negative Z-scores). Regarding daily recreational habits, the participant reports no engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, or reading, which is unusual and indicates a significant deviation from typical student behaviors (associated Z-scores range from -0.56 to -1.25). Internet usage is moderate (Internet Usage Z-score: -0.49), and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for a short duration (Sedentary Hobby Z-score: 0.23).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals some deviations from population norms. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.49), potentially indicating good cardiovascular fitness. The mesor, representing the midpoint of the heart rate rhythm, is also notably low (Mesor Z-score: -2.13). However, the intradaily variability of heart rate is high (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.44), suggesting significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. This contrasts with a low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.9), indicating less regularity in daily patterns. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is observed at 2:42 PM. In terms of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, the participant shows significantly lower heart rates during the night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am: -16.92, 3-4 am: -23.28) and elevated heart rates during typical waking hours, particularly between 7-8 am (17.41) and 7-8 pm (22.23). This diurnal pattern of heart rate fluctuation is pronounced. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes (Z-score: 0.28), which is slightly above average, but the standard deviation for both sleep duration and start time is elevated (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.61; Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 1.12), suggesting inconsistency in sleep patterns. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score (PSQI Z-Score: 0.59).

The correlation coefficients between individual metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) provide additional context. Negative correlations are observed for metrics associated with lower perceived stress, such as higher self-esteem (SelfEsteem Score Correlation: -0.15), higher happiness (Happy Score Correlation: -0.19), and reading habits (Reading Score Correlation: -0.21). Conversely, positive correlations are seen with metrics that might indicate higher stress, such as greater variability in heart rate throughout the day (Intradaily Variability Score Correlation: 0.16) and a higher resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Score Correlation: 0.14). However, many of these correlations are weak, indicating that while some relationships exist, they do not strongly dictate the PSS score in isolation.

Considering the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population. This assessment is based on the generally positive self-reported psychological indicators, including low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness. While the sleep quality is reported as disturbed, and there are notable irregularities in sleep timing and heart rate variability, these do not appear to be strongly correlated with higher perceived stress in this dataset. The absence of substance usage and moderate engagement in social activities further suggest coping mechanisms that may mitigate stress. The participant’s PSQI score (8.0) falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, and the PSQI Z-Score (0.59) indicates this is slightly above average for the population. This, coupled with elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 1.44), suggests some physiological indicators of potential stress or irregularity. However, the overall profile leans towards lower to average stress levels when considering the strong positive self-reported psychological measures and the generally healthy lifestyle choices otherwise indicated.

59673,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological markers. In terms of self-reported psychological states, the participant reports relatively low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score of -0.66) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.43), both falling below the population average. This is complemented by a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (50.0, Z-score of 1.66), indicating a robust sense of self-worth. However, health satisfaction is notably low (2.67, Z-score of -1.2), suggesting a potential discrepancy between psychological well-being and perceived physical health. Trust in others is slightly above average (3.83, Z-score of 1.15), while self-reported happiness is also above the mean (4.0, Z-score of 0.55).

Lifestyle behaviors reveal moderate substance use patterns, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.94) and beer 1-2 times a month (Z-score of 0.3). Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage are reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity includes exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, but sports participation is notably absent (Frequency: ""Not at all"", Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational habits show limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less) and video games, with moderate internet usage and listening to music (31 minutes an hour). Socializing with friends and reading are also reported as occupying 31 minutes an hour, with a relatively low frequency of reading (Z-score of -0.67). The participant's GPA demonstrates consistently high academic performance across multiple semesters, with the latest Fall 2016 GPA at 3.92. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Score of 8.0, Z-Score of 0.59), and the median sleep duration is 7 hours and 37 minutes, which is slightly longer than the population average (Z-Score of 0.54). Sleep start times are notably late, with a median start time of 1:21 AM.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm appears relatively regular, indicated by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.09. However, Intradaily Variability is slightly elevated (Z-Score of 0.17), and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is lower than average (Z-Score of -0.7). The Mesor (average heart rate) is near the population mean (74.66, Z-Score of 0.1), and the Amplitude is also at the population average (10.79, Z-Score of 0.0). The Acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:58 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly below average (57.2, Z-Score of -0.11). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals interesting patterns relative to the Mesor. There are pronounced deviations during late night and early morning hours, with significant negative deviations (indicating heart rate below the average for that time of day) between 2 AM and 7 AM, reaching its lowest point between 4 AM and 6 AM. Conversely, heart rate deviations are positive during midday and evening hours, particularly between 1 PM and 2 PM, and again from 5 PM to 7 PM, suggesting periods of elevated physiological arousal later in the day. Sleep statistics indicate a longer median sleep duration than average, but with significant variability in both duration (Z-Score of 0.98) and start time (Z-Score of 0.33). There is also a notable frequency of napping (0.18, Z-Score of 1.27).

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported psychological data, including low scores on depression and anxiety scales and high self-esteem, suggest a general internal well-being that would typically correlate with lower perceived stress. However, a significantly low health satisfaction score and a PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" indicate potential areas of concern that could contribute to elevated stress. The Fitbit data reveals a late sleep schedule and considerable variability in sleep patterns, which can be stressors. Furthermore, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows pronounced deviations, particularly during the early morning hours and periods of potential wakefulness later in the day, which could reflect physiological responses to stress or irregular routines. The relatively high academic achievement (GPA) is often associated with higher stress levels, although in this case, the participant's psychological measures do not strongly reflect this. Considering the moderate deviations in physiological data, particularly the sleep disturbances and heart rate patterns, alongside a low health satisfaction score, there is evidence that suggests the participant may experience moderate to elevated perceived stress. While not overwhelmingly high, the constellation of these factors, especially the sleep irregularity and physiological fluctuations, lean towards the higher end of the stress spectrum, potentially placing them in the top 50% of the study population.

74899,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful examination in relation to perceived stress. Self-report data indicate elevated levels of anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI score of 52.0, which is 1.06 standard deviations above the mean, and a moderate burden of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 17.0, 0.38 standard deviations above the mean). Subjective sleep quality is also reported as disturbed, with a PSQI score of 9.0, placing the participant 1.05 standard deviations above the population mean, and an objectively low median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours (Z-score of -1.52). This pattern of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality is often associated with higher perceived stress.

Furthermore, behavioral patterns suggest potential coping mechanisms or lifestyle factors that may influence stress levels. The participant reports substance usage of beer 1-2 times a week, which is 1.01 standard deviations above the population mean, indicating a more frequent pattern than average. Regular physical activity is also noted, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), and exercising with others and participating in sports occurring 1-2 times a week. However, sedentary habits such as reading and engaging in a sedentary hobby are reported as ""Do not do,"" with low Z-scores, suggesting limited engagement in these potentially stress-mitigating activities. The participant also reports higher-than-average trust in others (Z-score of 1.79) and lower-than-average happiness (Z-score of -0.53), which could reflect a more cautious or less optimistic outlook.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal several notable patterns. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score of 0.47) and a relatively high mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint) in their heart rate data (Z-score of 0.95), suggesting a generally elevated baseline physiological arousal. The hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -14.5 to -21.29 standard deviations from 7-8 AM), aligning with the reported very late sleep start time (median 02:25:30). There is a significant increase in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., +14.62 to +22.1 standard deviations from 4-5 PM to 5-6 PM), potentially reflecting increased activity or stress responses during this period. The circadian rhythm metrics show moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.46) and relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.17), suggesting some irregularity in the daily rhythm of physiological activity. The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported as 5:49 PM, which falls within the period of increased heart rate deviation.

Considering the combined self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant exhibits several indicators associated with higher perceived stress. The co-occurrence of elevated anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, and objectively low sleep duration, coupled with a higher resting heart rate and mesor, points towards a state of heightened physiological and psychological strain. While the participant engages in regular exercise, the low engagement in sedentary hobbies and reading, alongside frequent beer consumption, may not fully buffer against these stressors. The irregular circadian rhythm further suggests a potential disruption in the body's natural regulatory processes, which can be exacerbated by stress.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the **top_50** percentile of the study population. This conclusion is supported by a confluence of factors that indicate elevated stress. The self-reported elevated levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.06) and moderate depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: 0.38) are strong indicators of psychological distress. Subjective reports of disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 1.05), combined with objectively low median sleep duration (Z-score: -1.52), suggest a significant physiological and psychological toll, as insufficient and poor-quality sleep is a common consequence and contributor to high stress. The wearable data further corroborate this, with a higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.47) and a higher mesor (Z-score: 0.95) suggesting a state of sustained physiological arousal. The pronounced deviations in hourly heart rate, particularly the elevated heart rate during late afternoon and evening, could reflect a heightened stress response. The moderate intradaily variability and low interdaily stability in circadian rhythm metrics indicate a less regulated daily physiological pattern, which can be characteristic of individuals experiencing higher stress. While some correlations between individual metrics and PSS were not strongly negative or positive, the overall pattern of multiple indicators pointing towards distress strongly suggests an elevated PSS score. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's perceived stress level places them in the upper half of the study distribution.

35011,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics to interpret perceived stress levels in a university student. The participant demonstrates a mixed profile of psychological and behavioral indicators. Subjectively, the participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.52) and relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of 0.96), which typically correlate with lower perceived stress. However, they also report a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score of 0.7), which has a positive correlation with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is notably low (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -1.78), suggesting potential underlying physical or mental health concerns that may contribute to stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with weekly consumption of beer and wine or liquor (Beer Z-score of 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score of 0.94), and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is low, particularly individual exercise and sports (Exercised Alone Z-score of -0.43, Sports Z-score of 0.25), which is a suboptimal strategy for stress management. Daily recreational habits indicate a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.64) and internet usage (Z-score of 0.18), while other sedentary activities like reading and dedicated hobbies are not engaged in. Socializing with friends is reported at a lower frequency (Z-score of -0.62), potentially limiting a key source of social support.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a significantly elevated resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 2.31), which can be an indicator of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and thus, stress. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a high Mesor (Value of 86.67, Z-score of 1.74), indicating a higher average heart rate throughout the day. Conversely, the amplitude is notably low (Value of 4.29, Z-score of -2.1), suggesting a reduced daily variation in heart rate, which can be indicative of a blunted diurnal rhythm, potentially related to stress or poor sleep. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is observed at 5:46 PM. The participant's daily heart rate patterns show several hours with deviations from the mesor that are significantly higher than population norms, particularly during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 am, Z-score of 1.82; 5-6 am, Z-score of 1.65; 6-7 am, Z-score of 1.18). These elevated heart rates during periods typically associated with rest could reflect physiological arousal or anticipation of the day's demands.

Sleep patterns are suboptimal, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score of -1.37), which is below the average and accompanied by a disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score (Z-Score of 0.13, classification of 'Disturbed Sleep'). The median sleep start time is late at 2:34 AM, with a standard deviation indicating some variability in sleep onset. The low interdaily stability (Value of 0.17, Z-score of -1.98) and high intradaily variability (Value of 0.74, Z-score of 1.37) in heart rate data suggest a lack of regularity and significant fluctuations in daily activity patterns, which are often associated with higher stress levels.

In summary, while the participant reports low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, several factors point towards elevated perceived stress. These include high resting heart rate, disturbed sleep quality and duration, a blunted circadian amplitude, elevated heart rate during early morning hours, and a lack of regularity in daily activity patterns. The presence of depressive symptoms and low health satisfaction further contribute to this interpretation.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, considering the constellation of available data, is likely to place them in the top 50% of the study population. Evidence for this conclusion includes a significantly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score of 2.31), which is a strong physiological indicator of stress. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm data reveals a high Mesor (Z-score of 1.74) and a blunted amplitude (Z-score of -2.1), suggesting a less regulated physiological system. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score of -1.37), which is below the population average and is classified as disturbed sleep by the PSQI (Z-score of 0.13). The low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.98) and high intradaily variability (Z-score of 1.37) in heart rate data point towards irregular daily routines and significant physiological fluctuations, which are often hallmarks of elevated stress. While trait anxiety is low, the presence of depressive symptoms (Z-score of 0.7) and notably low health satisfaction (Z-score of -1.78) also contribute to the overall picture of psychological strain. Conversely, factors suggesting lower perceived stress, such as low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, are outweighed by these physiological and behavioral indicators of stress. Therefore, the holistic assessment of the provided multimodal data strongly suggests a perceived stress level that is likely above the median.

Self-reported data reveal elevated levels of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 39.0 (Z-score: 2.67), falling within the ""Depressed"" classification and correlating positively with perceived stress. Similarly, trait anxiety is elevated with an STAI score of 55.0 (Z-score: 1.35), classified as ""anxious"" and showing a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress. In contrast, self-esteem is relatively low, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 25.0 (Z-score: -1.85), correlating negatively with perceived stress. Trust in others is also on the lower end (Score: 2.33, Z-score: -1.74), with a negligible correlation to stress. Happiness levels are also reported as low (Current: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), with a moderate negative correlation to perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is poor, with a score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52) indicating ""Disturbed Sleep."" This aligns with Fitbit-derived sleep metrics, which show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 44 minutes (Z-score: -0.56), suggesting shorter than average sleep, and a median sleep start time of 01:25:49, indicating a delayed sleep schedule. The standard deviation for sleep start time is notable (Z-score: 1.09), suggesting variability in bedtime.

Behavioral patterns indicate a moderate engagement in social activities with friends (Time: 1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16), but a considerable amount of time is spent on less active pursuits. Specifically, internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.19) and listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06) are notably high. Video game usage is also elevated (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 1.71), while reading time is relatively low (16-30 minutes, Z-score: 1.3, with a negative correlation to stress). Exercise habits are mixed, with infrequent solo exercise (1-2 times a month, Z-score: -0.43) but more regular exercise with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.53). Substance use indicates moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is within the average range (Value: 58.2, Z-score: 0.01). The circadian rhythm analysis shows a low interdaily stability (Value: 0.22, Z-score: -1.56), suggesting less regularity in daily patterns, and moderate intradaily variability (Value: 0.55, Z-score: 0.03). The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Value: 70.67, Z-score: -0.45), and the amplitude is also lower than average (Value: 7.57, Z-score: -1.04), indicating a less pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, is observed around 4:57 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of increased deviation from the mesor, particularly in the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 5-6 PM, 8-9 PM), which may reflect periods of heightened physiological arousal or stress. Notably, the 5-6 PM period shows a significant deviation from the mesor (Value: 20.32, Z-score: 1.43).

The participant's elevated scores on measures of depression (CESD), anxiety (STAI), and disturbed sleep (PSQI), coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, and a tendency towards more sedentary activities and irregular sleep patterns, collectively point towards a higher perceived stress level. While some behaviors, such as exercise with others, are moderate, they are overshadowed by the indicators of psychological distress and sleep disturbances. The positive correlations between CESD, STAI, and PSS, and the negative correlations between Self-Esteem, Happy, and PSS, reinforce these findings. The combination of these factors suggests that this participant likely experiences a higher than average level of perceived stress within the study population.

97596,32.0,1.0,"The participant's self-reported data indicates elevated levels of distress and impaired sleep. The CES-D score of 33.0, with a Z-score of 2.05, suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms, placing them in the 98th percentile for this measure. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 47.0, with a Z-score of 0.56, indicates a proneness to chronic anxiety. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 15.0, exhibiting a Z-score of 3.83, signifies clinically significant disturbed sleep, with a 99.9th percentile ranking for this metric. Conversely, self-esteem (RSES score 36.0, Z-score -0.31) and trust (score 2.83, Z-score -0.78) appear to be within or below average ranges. Happiness is reported at a low level (current score 2.0, Z-score -1.61). Health satisfaction is moderately positive (score 5.22, Z-score 0.72). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is strong, with a trend of improvement across semesters.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in extensive daily recreation, particularly listening to music for over 4 hours (Z-score 2.06) and spending 2-3 hours socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95). Reading for 16-30 minutes is also reported (Z-score 1.3), while time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is relatively low. Internet usage falls within an average range. Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise is moderately consistent, with exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and exercising with others once or twice a week (Z-score 0.53), though participation in sports is absent.

Wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by moderate Interdaily Stability (Value 0.39, Z-score -0.16) and moderate Intradaily Variability (Value 0.66, Z-score 0.81). The Mesor (Value 77.83, Z-score 0.53) and Amplitude (Value 10.93, Z-score 0.05) of the heart rate rhythm are within typical ranges. The Acrophase, at 4:14 PM, suggests peak cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon. The resting heart rate (Value 63.6, Z-score 0.65) is slightly elevated. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates periods of elevated physiological arousal in the late morning and early evening (e.g., 9-10 AM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM), with the highest positive deviations observed between 5-6 PM (16.29) and 6-7 PM (17.13). Conversely, the deepest troughs in heart rate deviation occur during the night, particularly between 4-5 AM (-17.95) and 5-6 AM (-18.27). Sleep duration is notably long, with a median of 8 hours and 10 minutes (Z-score 1.22), and sleep start times are consistently late, with a median of 00:31:32 and a standard deviation of 90 minutes, suggesting a tendency towards a delayed sleep phase.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to be in the **top_50** percentile. This conclusion is primarily driven by the significantly elevated scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D), anxiety (STAI), and particularly sleep disturbance (PSQI), which are all strongly correlated with perceived stress. The Z-scores for CES-D (2.05) and PSQI (3.83) are particularly high, indicating substantial psychological and physiological distress. While academic performance is strong and some social behaviors are positive, the overwhelming evidence from mental health and sleep metrics points towards a high level of perceived stress that significantly impacts well-being. The moderate correlation coefficients, though not overriding the analysis, generally align with a scenario where these distress indicators would contribute to a higher PSS score.

57359,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data indicate a generally stable psychological state with some potential areas for attention regarding sleep quality. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and anxiety (STAI score of 39.0, Z-score -0.23), classifying them as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" respectively. Self-esteem is reported as moderately high (RSES score of 35.0, Z-score -0.45), and overall happiness is relatively low (Happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53), though the latter has a weak negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.19). Health satisfaction is also rated as moderate (Score 3.78, Z-score -0.37), with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress. Trust in others is slightly above average (Score 3.33, Z-score 0.18). Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week), no recreational or non-prescribed drug usage, and infrequent exercise alone (1-2 times a month), with no exercise with others. Sports participation is moderate (1-2 times a week). Daily recreational habits are characterized by low engagement in passive activities like watching TV (15 minutes or less) and moderate engagement in internet usage (2-3 hours), listening to music (31 minutes an hour), and socializing with friends (1-2 hours). Notably, reading is reported as ""Do not do,"" with a moderate negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.21). The participant's BMI is within the healthy range at 23.92.

Analysis of the wearable data reveals patterns in sleep and physiological rhythm that warrant closer examination in relation to perceived stress. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average median sleep duration (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-score 1.18), suggesting adequate time spent asleep. However, the PSQI score of 6.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.33, indicates subjective difficulties with sleep quality, which has a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:05:32), with a relatively stable standard deviation in sleep start times (74 minutes, Z-score -0.19). The average number of daily naps is slightly elevated (0.18, Z-score 1.27), which could be a compensatory behavior for poor sleep quality. In terms of circadian rhythm metrics, the interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (0.43, Z-score 0.17), suggesting some regularity in daily cycles, while intraday variability is relatively low (0.51, Z-score -0.25), potentially indicating a less dynamic cardiovascular response throughout the day. The MESOR (average daily heart rate) is slightly below average (70.97, Z-score -0.41), and the amplitude is slightly above average (11.51, Z-score 0.24), suggesting a potentially wider daily fluctuation in heart rate around the average. The resting heart rate is notably low (52.3, Z-score -0.7), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness.

The hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. During nighttime hours (12 AM to 6 AM), there are significant negative deviations, with the largest occurring between 3-4 AM (-22.17, Z-score -0.92) and 4-5 AM (-22.22, Z-score -0.68), indicating lower-than-average heart rates during these periods, consistent with deep sleep. As the morning progresses, heart rate begins to increase, with positive deviations observed from 8 AM onwards. The period between 8-9 AM shows a substantial positive deviation (17.81, Z-score 2.26), suggesting a sharp increase in arousal upon waking or during the early morning activities. Other notable periods of elevated heart rate include 10-11 AM (12.89, Z-score 1.14), 7-8 PM (17.82, Z-score 1.1), and 8-9 PM (15.56, Z-score 1.04). These patterns suggest a robust increase in physiological activation during the morning and early evening, with a general trend of heart rate settling down later in the evening. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is reported as 4:00 PM, aligning with the observed positive deviations in the late afternoon. The weak to moderate correlations observed between these metrics and the PSS score generally do not indicate strong linear relationships, but patterns of disrupted sleep and elevated morning arousal could be indirectly related to perceived stress.

Based on the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score likely falls in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population, indicating relatively low or average perceived stress. While the participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 6.0), which can be associated with higher stress, this is offset by other factors. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.24) and anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23), and moderately high self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.45). Their health satisfaction is also at a moderate level (Z-score -0.37). Behaviorally, they exhibit moderate social engagement and moderate internet usage, with low engagement in passive leisure. Critically, many of the wearable metrics do not show strong positive correlations with PSS. The resting heart rate is notably low (Z-score -0.7), suggesting good physiological regulation. While there are periods of elevated heart rate during the day, particularly in the morning and early evening, the overall circadian rhythm exhibits some stability. The moderate sleep duration and the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" are the primary indicators that might suggest higher stress. However, considering the absence of significant psychological distress indicators and the generally healthy physiological profile, it is more probable that the participant experiences a PSS score within the lower half of the distribution.

17308,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors, some of which are associated with perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate level of trait anxiety, with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score falling within the classification of ""anxious"" and a Z-score of 0.17. While not indicative of extreme distress, this suggests a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety. Interestingly, the participant reports a relatively high level of happiness (Z-score: 0.55), which contrasts with their anxiety proneness. The participant's self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.17), and their reported health satisfaction is above average (Z-score: 0.8), suggesting that despite potential anxieties and moderate self-esteem, their overall outlook on physical health is positive. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are not a significant concern (Z-score: -0.14), and their subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a low Z-score of -0.8, suggesting adequate subjective sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with weekly consumption of beer and wine or liquor, falling above average for beer (Z-score: 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score: 0.94). They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are notable, with exercise frequency categorized as ""Three times a week or more"" for exercising alone (Z-score: 1.07), placing them in the higher end of the distribution for this behavior. They also engage in exercise with others and sports participation at a moderate frequency (1-2 times a week). Daily recreation habits indicate relatively low engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less) and moderate engagement in listening to music (16-30 minutes). They report minimal internet usage (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -1.83) and significantly less time spent socializing with friends than the average participant (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.41). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in video games or reading, and also refrains from sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, as indicated by Fitbit data, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits some deviations from the population norm. Their Mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is notably low (Z-score: -1.79), suggesting a generally lower baseline cardiovascular activity. Their resting heart rate is also below average (Z-score: -1.3). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during waking hours, particularly in the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 10-11am, 3-6pm), with significant positive deviations (e.g., 10-11am: 18.65, Z-score: 1.98; 4-5pm: 16.95, Z-score: 1.21). Conversely, heart rate during the early morning hours (1-6am) is consistently lower than the Mesor, as expected. The circadian rhythm metrics of interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -0.53) are slightly below average, indicating some variability in rhythm regularity. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 27 minutes, which is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.33), and a relatively consistent sleep start time (standard deviation: 36 minutes, Z-score: -1.02).

Considering the overall data, the participant exhibits a moderate level of trait anxiety and a tendency towards higher physical activity. The elevated heart rate during specific waking hours, coupled with lower than average Mesor and resting heart rate, suggests potential physiological responses that may be related to stress or arousal. While subjective sleep quality is good and depressive symptoms are low, the anxious disposition and specific patterns of physiological arousal warrant consideration. The participant's PSS score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the distribution, considering the absence of strong indicators for high stress. While trait anxiety is present, it is balanced by high happiness and good subjective sleep. The physiological data, though showing some deviations, does not definitively point to chronic high stress. The moderate engagement in social activities and sedentary hobbies, along with high physical activity, may contribute to a more balanced stress profile.

51851,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents a complex profile with several notable features influencing their perceived stress levels. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62) and depression symptoms (CESD Z-score: 0.07), aligning with a classification of ""not anxious"" and ""not depressed."" Furthermore, self-esteem is reported as high, with a Z-score of 1.1, and happiness is also moderately high (Z-score: -0.53). Health satisfaction, however, is notably elevated with a Z-score of 1.63, suggesting a positive outlook on physical well-being. Despite these generally positive psychological indicators, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" according to the PSQI (Z-score: 0.59), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes, which falls below the typical recommendation and has a slightly negative Z-score (-0.28). Sleep onset time shows moderate variability (Z-score: 0.61), suggesting potential challenges in establishing a consistent sleep schedule.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with associated Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively. They report no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity is robust, with frequent engagement in exercising alone, with others, and in sports (Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58, respectively). Daily recreational habits reveal a preference for listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score: 1.13) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16), while engaging less in passive activities like watching TV/videos (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.62) and significantly less in reading (not at all, Z-score: -0.67). Internet usage and video games are also reported at lower frequencies.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a considerably low resting heart rate (Z-score: -2.03), alongside a low mean heart rate Mesor (Z-score: -1.9). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.74), suggesting less regularity in daily patterns, coupled with moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.23), indicating more fluctuations within a day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score: -0.36), further supporting potential disruptions in circadian rhythmicity. The mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor indicates periods of significantly lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score: -1.1, 4-5 AM Z-score: -0.48, 6-7 AM Z-score: -1.17). Conversely, the evening hours, particularly between 6 PM and 11 PM, show consistently higher deviations from the Mesor, peaking between 8-9 PM (Z-score: 1.27) and 10-11 PM (Z-score: 1.57), suggesting increased physiological arousal during these times.

Considering the overall pattern of results, the participant demonstrates a mixed profile. While self-reported psychological well-being indicators such as anxiety and depression are low, and self-esteem is high, these are counterbalanced by subjective reports of disturbed sleep and objectively lower-than-average sleep duration. The robust engagement in physical activity and social interaction are positive behavioral markers. However, the physiological data reveals a potentially disrupted circadian rhythm, characterized by low interdaily stability and higher heart rate variability in the evenings, which can be associated with increased stress. The correlation data also provides some direction; for instance, higher CES-D scores correlate positively with PSS (0.28), STAI with PSS (0.31), and PSQI with PSS (implied by disturbed sleep and positive correlation with PSS). Conversely, higher self-esteem, trust, and happiness correlate negatively with PSS, as do lower usage of substances and more sedentary hobbies. The significant deviation in heart rate during evening hours, coupled with suboptimal sleep duration and perceived sleep quality, may contribute to elevated stress levels, despite the absence of overt psychological distress markers. Given the population's PSS mean of 21.62 and 50th percentile of 22.0, and considering the potential impact of disturbed sleep and physiological arousal patterns on perceived stress, this participant's overall perceived stress level likely falls towards the higher end of the distribution.

77872,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant exhibits a profile characterized by relatively low levels of subjective psychological distress, with a CES-D score indicating no significant depressive symptomatology and an STAI-Trait score suggesting low chronic anxiety proneness. This is further supported by a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and a favorable self-assessment of health satisfaction. Trust in others and self-reported happiness are also within average to slightly above average ranges relative to the study population. The participant's academic performance, as indicated by their GPA, is moderate, with a slight downward trend observed between Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as good, and the objective sleep metrics from the Fitbit are generally within normative ranges, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 50 minutes and a low standard deviation in sleep start times, suggesting some regularity in sleep patterns.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (beer 1-2 times a week, wine/liquor 1-2 times a month) and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits involve moderate frequency of exercising alone and with others (1-2 times a week), with no participation in sports. Leisure activities are predominantly sedentary, with limited time spent on watching TV/videos, video games, and internet usage. Notably, the participant dedicates a significant amount of time to reading (16-30 minutes daily) and listening to music (31 minutes an hour), suggesting a preference for introspective and auditory forms of recreation.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as inferred from Fitbit data, shows some notable characteristics. The Mesor (average heart rate) is elevated relative to the population mean, and the Amplitude is also higher, suggesting a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, indicating the peak heart rate time, is recorded at 5:58 PM. While the Interdaily Stability is near the population mean, the Intradaily Variability is significantly lower, indicating a more regular pattern of heart rate fluctuations throughout the day. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal a pronounced dip in the early morning hours (4-7 AM), a common pattern reflecting sleep. A substantial increase in heart rate deviation is observed during the late afternoon and early evening (5-6 PM), aligning with the Acrophase. Other periods throughout the day show moderate deviations, with some notable peaks in the late evening (11 PM - 12 AM). The Resting Heart Rate is at the population average.

Considering the participant's overall profile, the data suggest a general psychological well-being characterized by low perceived stress, good sleep quality, and moderate engagement in social and physical activities. While sedentary habits and some elevated physiological markers (Mesor, Amplitude) are present, these do not appear to be strongly correlated with negative psychological outcomes in this dataset. The self-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem are all favorable, and the objective physiological data does not present immediate alarms concerning stress levels. The correlations provided do not highlight any particularly strong negative associations with PSS. For instance, while Intradaily Variability has a positive correlation with PSS, this participant exhibits a significantly low value for this metric. Conversely, activities that might be associated with higher stress, such as high substance usage or low self-esteem, are not observed here.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** of the study population distribution. This assessment is based on the confluence of several factors. Firstly, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score Z-score of -0.24) and chronic anxiety (STAI-Trait score Z-score of -0.82), both of which are typically associated with higher PSS scores. Their self-esteem is high (SelfEsteem score Z-Score of 0.82) and health satisfaction is also notably high (Health Satisfaction score Z-score of 0.97). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI Z-Score of -0.8), and while median sleep duration is slightly below the population average (Z-Score of -0.44), the consistency in sleep start times (Z-Score of -0.02) suggests good sleep hygiene. Furthermore, objective physiological data, such as Intradaily Variability of heart rate (Z-score of -1.31), which has a positive correlation with PSS, is significantly lower than the population average, suggesting greater regularity in their physiological rhythms. While the Mesor and Amplitude of heart rate are elevated (Z-scores of 0.65 and 0.75 respectively), and there are pronounced deviations from the Mesor during late afternoon/early evening, these are not directly linked to significantly elevated PSS scores in the provided correlations. The lack of strong positive correlations between observed metrics and PSS, combined with the generally positive psychological and behavioral indicators, points towards a lower overall perceived stress level.

72348,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits several behavioral and physiological characteristics that may inform an understanding of their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.23), alongside moderate self-esteem (RSES Z-Score: -0.59). The participant reports high academic achievement, with GPAs consistently above 3.6. However, subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-Score: 0.59), suggesting potential underlying issues despite objectively measured sleep duration being notably longer than the population median (Median Sleep Duration Z-Score: 1.48).

Wearable data reveals a highly regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by high Interdaily Stability (Z-Score: 1.99) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-Score: 2.49). This regularity is further supported by a higher than average Mesor (Z-Score: 1.69), which is the average 24-hour value of a periodic function. The pattern of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor for heart rate shows distinct diurnal variations, with pronounced deviations during the late morning and midday hours (e.g., 8-9 AM and 9-10 AM show positive deviations of 10.2 and 16.63 respectively, with Z-scores of 1.5 and 1.71). Conversely, late night and early morning hours exhibit negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate activity during these periods. The overall amplitude of heart rate variation is moderate (Z-Score: 0.23). Resting heart rate is elevated compared to the population (Z-Score: 1.55).

Behavioral habits indicate a generally sedentary lifestyle with high durations of internet usage (Z-Score: 1.52) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score: 1.28), while exercise frequency is low, particularly group exercise (Exercised with Others Frequency Z-Score: -0.88). Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories.

The data suggests a profile of an academically successful individual with generally positive psychological self-assessments in terms of anxiety and depression. However, there are indicators of potential stress or strain, including a higher than average resting heart rate and reported disturbed sleep quality, which contrasts with a long median sleep duration. The highly regular circadian rhythm and elevated mesor, coupled with high morning heart rate deviations, might reflect physiological responses to daily demands, even in the absence of high subjective anxiety. The low levels of physical activity and high sedentary behavior could also be contributing factors to physiological patterns observed.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score needs to be evaluated in relation to the study population's distribution. The population PSS mean is 21.61 with a standard deviation of 3.68, placing the 50th percentile (median) at 22.0. Considering the individual data, the participant exhibits several factors that might align with a higher PSS score. While they report low anxiety and depression, these are trait measures and may not fully capture state stress. The self-reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-Score: 0.59), even with a long sleep duration, is a significant indicator of potential stress. Furthermore, the elevated resting heart rate (Z-Score: 1.55) and the pronounced positive deviations in heart rate during daytime working hours (e.g., 9-10 AM Z-score: 1.71) suggest heightened physiological arousal that could be associated with perceived stress. Although correlations are generally low and not uniformly indicative, the presence of disturbed sleep and elevated resting heart rate are generally associated with higher stress levels in the literature. The sedentary lifestyle and high screen time are also commonly linked to stress. Given these indicators, particularly the disturbed sleep and physiological arousal markers, it is plausible that the participant experiences a level of perceived stress that would place them in the upper half of the distribution.

89607,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant's self-reported survey data indicate a psychological profile characterized by elevated levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, alongside a higher-than-average propensity for anxiety as measured by the STAI. While self-esteem is within the normative range, a lower-than-average score on happiness and satisfaction with health, coupled with a high score on the PSQI suggesting disturbed sleep, points towards a potentially vulnerable psychological state. Behavioral data reveals regular engagement in vigorous physical activity, including exercising alone and with others, and participation in sports at a high frequency, which is a positive coping mechanism. However, this is juxtaposed with significant time spent on video games and sedentary hobbies, and moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor), suggesting a mixed pattern of engagement and potential avoidance behaviors.

Analysis of the wearable-derived physiological data reveals a number of noteworthy patterns. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average resting heart rate, which, when combined with a high mesor (average circadian rhythm value) and amplitude, suggests a generally elevated physiological arousal. The mean hourly deviation from the mesor indicates periods of significant cardiovascular activity, particularly during the late morning and early afternoon (12 PM - 3 PM), which align with typical waking hours and potential academic or social demands. Conversely, during the early morning hours (3 AM - 6 AM), there are substantial negative deviations, indicative of periods of lower physiological activity, possibly related to sleep. The acrophase occurring at 5:14 PM suggests the peak of the participant's daily physiological cycle is in the late afternoon/early evening. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is notably high, indicating a regular daily pattern, yet intradaily variability is below average, suggesting less fluctuation within the day-to-day rhythm once established. Sleep statistics show a longer-than-average median sleep duration, but also a higher than average frequency of daily naps, potentially reflecting efforts to compensate for fragmented or insufficient quality sleep. The standard deviations for sleep duration and start time are within the normative range, suggesting some consistency in sleep timing despite the napping behavior.

The participant's PSS score, when considered in relation to the population data (Mean PSS: 21.62, 50th percentile: 22.0), appears to fall within the lower half of the distribution. The self-report data, while indicating elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, and a tendency towards disturbed sleep, do not directly provide a PSS score. However, the negative correlation between happiness and PSS score (-0.19) and the positive correlation between STAI anxiety and PSS score (0.31) suggest that higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of happiness would be associated with higher perceived stress. The correlation with CES-D (0.28) also suggests a tendency for higher depressive symptoms to align with higher stress. The significant positive Z-scores for STAI and CES-D, and a notable negative Z-score for happiness, indicate that this participant is experiencing higher than average levels of anxiety and lower than average happiness relative to the study population. Despite these indicators of psychological distress, the strong engagement in physical activity and the stable, albeit potentially disrupted, sleep patterns may act as moderating factors. Given the median PSS of 22.0, and the participant's clear indicators of elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms alongside lower happiness, it is likely their PSS score falls within the upper half of the distribution, reflecting more than average perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, reporting consumption of beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times per week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively, indicating higher than average usage within the study population. Notably, there is no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are significantly below average, with the participant reporting no frequency of exercising alone, exercising with others, or participating in sports, as evidenced by Z-scores of -1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively. Daily recreation habits show a mixed pattern; while time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are close to the population average, the participant reports minimal time spent listening to music (Z-score of -0.72) and no time spent reading or playing video games. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score of 0.16).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest some regularity. The Mesor of 71.11 (Z-score of -0.39) and an Amplitude of 8.27 (Z-score of -0.81) indicate a moderate circadian rhythm, with the acrophase occurring at 4:37 PM. Interdaily Stability (0.32, Z-score of -0.74) and Intradaily Variability (0.38, Z-score of -1.16) suggest a less consistent daily rhythm compared to the population average. The resting heart rate is slightly above average at 59.1 bpm (Z-score of 0.11). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM showing deviations of -11.54 to -12.77 bpm), which is expected during sleep. A notable pattern is the increase in heart rate deviations during the early morning waking hours (6-8 AM), followed by a more gradual increase throughout the day, reaching peak deviations in the late afternoon/early evening (4-8 PM). The positive correlations between several early morning heart rate deviations (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, ranging from 0.14 to 0.22, suggest a potential association between physiological arousal during these periods and perceived stress.

Sleep statistics indicate a significantly longer than average median sleep duration (9 hours 22 minutes, Z-score of 2.71) and a greater than average variability in sleep duration and start times. The PSQI score of 14.0 (Z-score of 3.37) strongly suggests clinically significant sleep disturbance, classifying the participant's sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This is a key finding that warrants attention, particularly given the potential for poor sleep quality to influence perceived stress.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), needs to be assessed in relation to the study population distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.62, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. This participant's data does not include a direct PSS score, however, several metrics provide indirect evidence. The significantly elevated PSQI score (Z-score of 3.37) indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" is a strong indicator of potential elevated stress. While other psychological measures like CES-D and STAI-Trait suggest low levels of depression and anxiety, and self-esteem and happiness are within or above average ranges, the disturbed sleep is a salient factor. Furthermore, the positive correlations between early morning heart rate deviations and the PSS score suggest a physiological manifestation that could be linked to higher stress. Given that disturbed sleep is a common consequence and contributor to high perceived stress, and the positive correlations of certain physiological metrics with PSS, it is reasonable to infer that this participant likely experiences a higher level of perceived stress.

28254,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant exhibits several noteworthy patterns across self-reported psychological states, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.92), alongside high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.26). Happiness levels are slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53), and health satisfaction is moderately above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.55). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as disturbed, with a Z-score of 0.13 indicating it is slightly above the population mean for poor sleep quality.

Behaviorally, substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported at a frequency of 1-2 times per week, with corresponding Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94, respectively, suggesting higher than average consumption. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-scores of -0.31 and -0.11). Physical activity is moderate, with exercise alone occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32), while exercise with others and participation in sports are less frequent, occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-scores: -0.17 and 0.25). Daily sedentary habits include watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes), video games (15 minutes or less), and listening to music (16-30 minutes). Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported as 31 minutes to an hour, while reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged with for 15 minutes or less and 16-30 minutes, respectively. Notably, socialising with friends has a relatively low Z-score (-0.62), indicating less time spent on this activity compared to the population.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals some deviations from typical patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above average (Value: 61.9, Z-score: 0.45). Circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively low interdaily stability (Value: 0.28, Z-score: -1.07) and moderate intraday variability (Value: 0.46, Z-score: -0.6), suggesting a less structured daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase (peak time) of heart rate is observed around 1:27 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate periods of elevated heart rate during typical waking hours, particularly between 7 AM and 6 PM, with the most pronounced positive deviations occurring between 7-8 AM and 8-9 AM. Conversely, significant negative deviations are observed during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 10-11 PM). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 45 minutes, which is below average (Z-score: -0.53), and a significant variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 122 minutes, Z-score: 0.86), suggesting inconsistent sleep schedules. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also notably low (45 minutes, Z-score: -1.26), implying consistency within the shorter sleep periods.

Considering the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population. While there are indicators of potential stress, such as disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score), moderate alcohol consumption, and inconsistent sleep patterns, these are balanced by several factors suggesting a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, high self-esteem, and a moderately high satisfaction with their health. Furthermore, the negative correlations observed between PSS and measures of happiness, self-esteem, and reading time suggest that higher scores on these positive indicators are associated with lower perceived stress. The relatively low interdaily stability and high variability in sleep start times, while indicative of poor sleep hygiene, do not definitively point to high stress in isolation and could be influenced by other lifestyle factors. The positive correlations of PSS with some late-night heart rate deviations and sleep start time variability are present, but the overall psychological profile leans towards resilience and lower perceived stress.

35347,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a range of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant nuanced interpretation in relation to perceived stress. Self-report data indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.34) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02). Similarly, self-esteem is within a typical range (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.96, though the interpretation notes higher scores indicate greater self-esteem, and the given score is within a generally accepted positive range for the scale), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Trust in others is notably low (Trust Z-score: -2.07), suggesting potential interpersonal challenges or a predisposition towards suspicion. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.28).

Behavioral patterns reveal a mixed profile. The participant engages in substance use (beer, wine/liquor) at a frequency of 1-2 times a month, which is slightly above the population average for beer (Beer Z-score: 0.3). Recreational drug and non-prescribed drug use are infrequent. Physical activity is notably low, with exercise occurring less than 1-2 times a month and sports participation being absent (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.18, Exercised with Others Z-score: -0.88, Sports Z-score: -1.09). Conversely, sedentary activities are prevalent. Internet usage is high (more than 4 hours, Internet Usage Z-score: 2.19), as is reading time (more than 4 hours, Reading Z-score: 6.21), indicating significant time spent engaged in solitary, screen-based, or intellectual pursuits. Socializing with friends is also reported at a relatively high frequency (3-4 hours, Socializing with Friends Z-score: 1.74).

Wearable data highlight specific physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. The participant demonstrates a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by moderate Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.45, Z-score: 0.33) and Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.55, Z-score: 0.03). The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated (Value: 77.12, Z-score: 0.43), and the Amplitude of the rhythm is also higher than average (Value: 12.72, Z-score: 0.63), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian cycle, occurs in the early evening (6:18 PM). Resting heart rate is within the population norm (Value: 57.8, Z-score: -0.04). Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal distinct patterns of arousal. There is a pronounced dip in heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM deviation: -20.52, 5-6 AM deviation: -21.17), which is consistent with sleep. However, a significant increase in heart rate deviation occurs in the late afternoon and early evening, particularly between 6-7 PM (Value: 22.64, Z-score: 1.75) and 3-4 PM (Value: 13.5, Z-score: 0.83), suggesting heightened physiological arousal during these periods. Morning hours show a gradual increase in heart rate deviation from sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate generally good sleep duration, with a median of 8 hours and 29 minutes, which is significantly longer than the population average (Duration Z-score: 1.61). Sleep duration is also more consistent than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: 1.04). However, the median sleep start time is very late (02:12:00 AM), and the variability in sleep start time is below average (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.6), suggesting a consolidated but delayed sleep schedule. The participant also engages in frequent napping (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 2.66), which is significantly higher than the population norm. The PSQI score of 6.0, while indicating disturbed sleep according to the threshold, is only slightly below the population mean (Z-Score: -0.33), suggesting subjective sleep quality is not severely impaired despite the late sleep onset and napping.

Overall, this participant presents with low levels of reported anxiety and depression, but exhibits low self-esteem and trust. Behavioral patterns are characterized by significant sedentary time, particularly internet usage and reading, coupled with low physical activity. Physiological data suggest a robust circadian rhythm with a delayed sleep phase and elevated arousal in the late afternoon/early evening, potentially coinciding with academic or social demands. Despite a late sleep onset, overall sleep duration is ample, though napping frequency is high. The combination of low trust, high sedentary behavior, a pronounced late afternoon/early evening heart rate elevation, and a delayed sleep schedule could contribute to perceived stress.

Considering the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the top 50th percentile of the study population. While the participant reports low levels of anxiety and depression, these are not the sole indicators of perceived stress. The data reveals several potential stressors. The low trust score (Z-score: -2.07) suggests interpersonal difficulties that could contribute to stress. High internet usage (Z-score: 2.19) and sedentary habits, coupled with very low physical activity (Exercise Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.18), indicate a lifestyle that may not be conducive to stress management. The significant elevation in heart rate deviation from the mesor between 3 PM and 7 PM (peak at 6-7 PM with a Z-score of 1.75) suggests a period of heightened physiological arousal during a potentially demanding part of the day, which could be linked to academic pressures or social interactions. Furthermore, the extremely late median sleep start time (02:12:00 AM) and high frequency of napping (Z-score: 2.66), despite adequate total sleep duration, may indicate a disrupted or shifted circadian rhythm that can exacerbate stress. The PSQI score of 6.0, while not extremely high, falls above the general threshold for disturbed sleep, further supporting a potentially compromised sleep architecture. The positive correlation between Intradaily Variability of heart rate (0.16) and the negative correlation between reading time (-0.22) and PSS score, while not overwhelmingly strong, suggest that higher variability in daily physiological patterns and more extensive reading time might be associated with lower perceived stress, or conversely, lower variability and less reading might be associated with higher perceived stress. However, the other factors, particularly the physiological arousal during the late afternoon/evening and the delayed sleep phase, point towards potential stressors that could elevate perceived stress levels.

45641,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret perceived stress within a university student population. The participant exhibits a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 22.0, Z-score 0.9) and a tendency towards anxiety (STAI score of 46.0, Z-score 0.46), both of which positively correlate with perceived stress. Notably, self-reported happiness is relatively low (Z-score -0.53), and health satisfaction is also considerably low (Z-score -1.45), suggesting a potential underlying distress that may contribute to higher perceived stress. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows a slight decline between Fall 2015 (3.65) and Spring 2016 (3.29), though data for Fall 2016 is unavailable. Lifestyle habits indicate low engagement in physical activity, with exercise frequencies for ""Exercised Alone,"" ""Exercised with Others,"" and ""Sports"" all below 1-2 times a month, and substance usage is generally low. However, the participant reports significant engagement in sedentary leisure activities, including 2-3 hours of internet usage and sedentary hobbies, and over 30 minutes of watching TV/videos/movies daily.

Wearable data provides further insight into the participant's physiological state and behavioral regularity. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate regularity, with an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 1.41, indicating a more structured daily pattern compared to the population average. However, Intradaily Variability is below average (Z-score -0.53), suggesting a less fragmented pattern of activity within the day. The MESOR of 80.02 (Z-score 0.83) and Amplitude of 13.3 (Z-score 0.81) are both elevated relative to the population, indicating a higher average heart rate and greater diurnal fluctuation. The Acrophase at 5:58 PM suggests a peak in heart rate in the late afternoon. Heart rate analysis reveals significant deviations from the mesor during late evening and night hours, with the 9-10 PM period showing the highest positive deviation (Z-score 1.83), followed by 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.13) and 11-12 AM (Z-score 1.24). Conversely, the early morning hours (3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM) show the most pronounced negative deviations, suggesting periods of lower cardiac activity during these times. Resting heart rate is also elevated (Z-score 0.6). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score 0.89), which is longer than average, but a relatively stable sleep start time (standard deviation of 50 minutes, Z-score -0.73). The PSQI score of 7.0 suggests disturbed sleep quality. The combination of elevated resting heart rate, pronounced late-evening cardiac activity deviations, and reported disturbed sleep quality, alongside moderate levels of reported anxiety and depression, suggests a physiological and psychological profile associated with elevated stress.

The participant's data indicates a profile that likely places them in the top 50% of the study population regarding perceived stress. Evidence for elevated stress includes moderate to high scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), coupled with low self-reported happiness and health satisfaction. The observed physiological patterns, such as an elevated MESOR and amplitude in heart rate, along with significant positive deviations in heart rate during late evening hours, suggest increased physiological arousal. This is further supported by a reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 7.0). While sleep duration is slightly longer than average, the overall picture suggests a state of heightened physiological and psychological activation that is not adequately managed, consistent with higher levels of perceived stress. The sedentary lifestyle, particularly extensive internet usage and sedentary hobbies, may also contribute to prolonged periods of lower physical activity interspersed with potential stressors.

64572,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted profile influenced by a confluence of psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological markers. Self-reported data indicate a relatively low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and a classification of ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score 35.0, Z-score -0.62). Self-esteem is measured at 42.0, which is above the typical range for the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, suggesting a positive self-regard. Subjective health satisfaction is moderate (score 3.67, Z-score -0.45), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Notably, the participant reports no substance usage for beer, wine or liquor, or recreational drugs. Regarding exercise, the participant engages in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91) and exercises alone with similar frequency (Z-score 0.32), but exercises with others less frequently (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.17). Daily recreational habits are generally moderate, with 1-2 hours spent on internet usage and socializing with friends, and 16-30 minutes dedicated to watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and sedentary hobbies. Reading time is reported as 15 minutes or less per day.

Physiologically, the participant presents with a notably low resting heart rate (50.3 bpm, Z-score -0.93), suggesting a potentially higher level of cardiovascular fitness or a parasympathetic dominant state. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a highly regular daily routine as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability (0.61, Z-score 1.66) and a relatively low Intradaily Variability (0.53, Z-score -0.11). The MESOR (67.23, Z-score -0.92) is also on the lower end of the population distribution. The Acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is observed at 4:57 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. There is a pronounced elevation in heart rate deviations during the evening hours, specifically from 7 PM to 10 PM, with peak deviations of +21.68, +23.64, and +18.4 (Z-scores 1.77, 2.47, and 1.81, respectively). Conversely, heart rate is significantly below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, with deviations reaching as low as -24.75 (Z-score -0.93). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is slightly below average (Z-score -0.69). The median sleep start time is around 00:42 AM, with moderate variability. The PSQI score of 6.0 suggests disturbed sleep, which is consistent with the common threshold for clinically significant sleep issues.

Overall, the participant demonstrates a profile characterized by low levels of reported anxiety and depression, coupled with a strong sense of self-esteem and consistent engagement in sports. Their physiological data suggest good cardiovascular health with a low resting heart rate. However, the significant elevations in heart rate during evening hours, particularly the pronounced peak between 8 PM and 9 PM, warrant attention. This physiological response, combined with a reported sleep quality index indicating disturbed sleep and a slightly shorter sleep duration than average, may suggest an underlying stress response, particularly as the academic semester progresses. The low PSQI score, while indicating disturbed sleep, does not strongly correlate with PSS scores in this dataset, and the elevated evening heart rate deviations are the most striking physiological finding in relation to potential stress. The strong circadian stability and low variability in heart rate throughout much of the day suggest a structured daily routine, which is typically associated with lower stress. However, the significant evening heart rate increases could reflect a response to stressors occurring during or after typical daytime activities.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is evaluated in relation to the study population's distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.61 with a standard deviation of 3.68, placing the 50th percentile at 22.0. The participant's psychological profile, characterized by low reported depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and healthy substance use habits, generally aligns with lower perceived stress. Their structured daily routines, as indicated by high interdaily stability in wearable data, are also typically associated with better stress management. However, the observed significant elevation in heart rate deviations during evening hours is a physiological indicator that may suggest increased stress response during this period. The PSQI score of 6.0 suggests disturbed sleep, which can be a consequence of stress. While correlations between PSS and individual metrics are provided to guide interpretation, a holistic view is paramount. Given the overall low self-reported psychological distress measures and consistent daily routines, it is more probable that the participant falls within the bottom half of the PSS distribution. The elevated evening heart rate, while notable, may represent a specific pattern of response that does not necessarily translate to a high overall perceived stress level compared to the broader study population, especially in the absence of strong direct correlations with PSS for this specific metric or a high PSQI score classification. The stronger indicators of lower perceived stress, such as low CES-D and STAI scores, and the general health and activity patterns, outweigh the single physiological indicator of evening heart rate elevation without further corroborating evidence of high stress.

28312,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological markers that warrant careful integration to understand their perceived stress levels. Subjectively, the participant reports moderate levels of anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score within the anxious classification, and a Z-score of 0.66, suggesting a slightly elevated tendency towards trait anxiety compared to the study population. While not clinically depressed according to the CES-D scale (Z-score 0.07), the positive correlation between CES-D and PSS (0.28) suggests that even a slight increase in depressive symptoms might be associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within an average range for the population (Z-score -0.45), with a weak negative correlation to PSS (-0.15), implying that lower self-esteem is not a significant driver of their stress in this dataset.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a pattern of generally infrequent engagement in activities associated with physical health and social connection. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is low (1-2 times a month), with a particularly low Z-score for participation in sports (-1.09). This low physical activity is weakly correlated with PSS, suggesting it is not a primary mediator of stress. Daily recreation habits lean towards passive consumption, with notable time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, while reading and sedentary hobbies are less frequent. The participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week), with negligible correlations to PSS. These habits, while not strongly correlated, do indicate a tendency towards less active stress management strategies.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest some disruption. Their mesor (mean heart rate across a 24-hour period) is elevated (Z-score 1.3), and their amplitude (variation around the mesor) is also notably high (Z-score 1.54), indicating a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate than the average participant. This heightened physiological response is weakly but positively correlated with PSS (0.06 and -0.17 respectively). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (5:32 PM), which is within the typical range. Further analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a generally higher-than-average heart rate during the latter half of the day and into the evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 21.85 deviation, Z-score 1.65), which might reflect periods of increased physiological arousal. Conversely, during the early morning hours (3-6 AM), the deviation from the mesor is significantly negative, indicating lower heart rates during this period, which is expected during sleep but may also reflect a more pronounced dip. Sleep duration is slightly above average (Median Sleep Duration 7 hours 35 minutes, Z-score 0.51), however, the median sleep start time is late (01:23:30) with a relatively high standard deviation (58 minutes), suggesting some irregularity in sleep timing. The PSQI score of 9.0, exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, further supports the notion of disturbed sleep, which is known to be associated with elevated stress.

Overall, the participant's data indicates a profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety, a tendency towards passive leisure activities, physiological markers of heightened arousal and amplitude in heart rate variability, and disturbed sleep patterns. While self-esteem and depressive symptoms are not overtly high, the combination of anxiety proneness, physiological stress responses, and sleep disturbances suggests a potential for elevated perceived stress. The PSQI score, in particular, is a strong indicator of sleep disturbance which is often intertwined with perceived stress. The elevated mesor and amplitude in heart rate, coupled with the late and variable sleep schedule, point towards a less regulated physiological state.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score appears to fall within the upper half of the study population distribution. Several indicators support this conclusion. The participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score of 0.66), which is a well-established correlate of higher perceived stress. Furthermore, their PSQI score (9.0) indicates disturbed sleep, a common consequence and contributing factor to elevated stress. Physiologically, the high mesor (Z-score 1.3) and amplitude (Z-score 1.54) of their heart rate suggest a heightened state of physiological arousal and variability, which can be indicative of stress. The higher-than-average heart rate deviations during the late afternoon and evening hours further support this. While the participant's self-esteem is not notably low, and depressive symptoms are not pronounced, the confluence of anxiety proneness, physiological reactivity, and disrupted sleep points towards a higher overall stress burden. Considering the population data, where the 50th percentile PSS score is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, the observed indicators suggest the participant likely experiences stress levels that are at least average and potentially elevated beyond the median.

56805,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant exhibits a complex profile with several notable characteristics that provide insight into their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate a generally positive psychological state, characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.28) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -2.11). Furthermore, self-esteem is above average (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.66), and happiness is also rated highly (Happy Z-score: 1.64). Health satisfaction is also notably high (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 2.05). These factors suggest a resilient psychological foundation, which might buffer against higher perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular physical activity, exercising with others three times a week or more (Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23) and participating in sports at a similar frequency (Sports Z-score: 1.58). This contrasts with a lower frequency of exercising alone (Exercised Alone Z-score: 0.32). Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories. Daily recreational habits are generally moderate to low, with significant time spent on the internet (Internet Usage Z-score: -1.83) being an exception, while activities like watching TV, video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading are engaged in for relatively short durations or not at all.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals several patterns. Their resting heart rate is notably low (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.66), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate relatively low stability and regularity in heart rate patterns across days (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.9) and moderate variability within a day (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -0.04). The mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is below population average (Mesor Z-score: -1.3), and the amplitude, reflecting the daily variation, is close to average (Amplitude Z-score: -0.01). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows significant decreases during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am Z-score: -1.92, 4-5am Z-score: -2.08), indicating a period of low physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during mid-morning (e.g., 8-9am Z-score: 1.94) and late morning (10-11am Z-score: 1.93), potentially reflecting waking activity or the start of the day's demands.

Sleep data presents a significant concern. The participant reports a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 33 minutes, which is substantially below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -2.02). The median sleep start time is very late, at 1:19 AM, with a standard deviation suggesting some variability in sleep timing (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.63). Despite these objective measures, the PSQI score indicates ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z-Score: -1.26), suggesting a potential discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep quality, or that the subjective assessment does not fully capture the detrimental effects of the observed sleep duration. The short sleep duration is a significant indicator of potential stress or lifestyle factors impacting rest.

Considering the holistic data, the participant presents with low levels of anxiety and depression and high self-esteem and happiness. Their physical activity is robust. However, the extremely short sleep duration is a significant detractor from overall well-being and a common indicator of elevated stress. While other factors are positive, the profound sleep deficit strongly suggests that the participant may be experiencing significant perceived stress that is impacting their ability to obtain adequate rest, potentially pushing them towards the higher end of the perceived stress spectrum.

26800,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This analysis focuses on interpreting a participant's psychological and behavioral data in relation to perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant, a male student, presents with a mean GPA of 3.87 across three academic terms, suggesting a strong academic performance. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a 'not depressed' classification on the CES-D scale (Z-score: -0.66), and generally low trait anxiety on the STAI scale (Z-score: -0.13). Self-esteem is reported at a high level (Z-score: 0.96), and health satisfaction is also within the typical range (Z-score: -0.2). The participant reports high trust in others (Z-score: -0.14) and moderate happiness levels (Z-score: -0.53).

Behavioral habits reveal a moderate consumption of alcohol (Beer and Wine/Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is characterized by infrequent solo exercise (Frequency: 'Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score: -1.18) and no exercise with others (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-score: -1.58). However, engagement in sports occurs 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational activities show limited engagement in passive screen time (Watching TV/Videos/Movies: 'Do not do', Z-score: -1.25) and video games (Z-score: -0.56), with moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.18). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.16), and reading is not a frequent activity ('Do not do', Z-score: -0.67).

Wearable data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.9) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.53). The mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is within the lower range of the population (Z-score: -0.91), suggesting a lower baseline cardiovascular activity. The resting heart rate is also notably low (Z-score: -1.04). Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a generally lower deviation from the mesor during sleep hours (e.g., 1-6 AM, with values ranging from -7.35 to -21.8) and higher deviations during typical waking hours, particularly between 9-11 AM (Z-scores of 2.2 and 1.43 respectively), indicating periods of increased physiological arousal during the late morning. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score: 0.06), with a relatively consistent sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 89 minutes, Z-score: 0.13). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI score: 5.0, Z-Score: -0.8), indicating no significant sleep disturbance.

In terms of perceived stress, the participant's data presents a mixed picture. While several self-report measures suggest a relatively positive psychological state (low anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep quality, moderate happiness), the moderate alcohol consumption and infrequent engagement in solitary and group exercise could be indicative of coping mechanisms or a reduced commitment to stress-reducing behaviors. The elevated heart rate deviations during the late morning hours (9-11 AM) might suggest periods of increased physiological stress or cognitive load during the academic day, aligning with a potential academic context. The correlations between PSS and the measured variables are generally weak and do not strongly indicate elevated stress based on these specific metrics. For instance, while STAI (anxiety) correlates positively with PSS (0.31), its Z-score is low. Similarly, self-esteem and happiness show negative correlations, which is expected, but their Z-scores are not indicative of extremely low levels. The PSQI score suggests good sleep, and its correlation with PSS is not provided but generally good sleep is associated with lower stress. The relatively consistent sleep duration and start time also contribute to a more stable physiological state. Considering the overall profile, the participant exhibits a blend of protective factors and some behaviors that may be associated with stress, but without extreme scores in any detrimental area. The median PSS score for the study population is 22.0. Given the available data, the participant's scores and behaviors suggest they are likely not experiencing significantly elevated stress compared to their peers.

47142,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents a complex profile with indicators that warrant careful consideration when evaluating perceived stress. Self-reported data reveals a notable level of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 19.0, which falls above the median for this scale, aligning with a classification of 'Depressed'. Complementing this, their STAI-Trait score of 43.0 suggests a proneness to chronic anxiety, placing them slightly above the population mean for this trait. Interestingly, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is within the average range, with a score of 35.0 and a slightly below average Z-score, indicating no significant deficits in this area. Health satisfaction is also reported at a moderate level. In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports no substance usage across beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, which is a positive behavioral indicator. However, their exercise habits show a low engagement with 'Exercised with Others' and 'Sports', with frequencies of 'Not at all', and only moderate engagement in 'Exercised Alone' (1-2 times a week). Daily recreational habits are predominantly sedentary, with low engagement in social activities ('Socializing with Friends') and moderate engagement in activities like 'Listening to Music' and 'Internet Usage', while 'Reading' and 'Video Games' are engaged in for shorter durations.

Wearable data provides further insights into physiological rhythms and sleep. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average Mesor (83.59), suggesting a generally elevated baseline heart rate. The hourly deviation from the Mesor indicates periods of increased cardiovascular activity during the evening and late night hours (e.g., 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM), which could reflect ongoing arousal or stress responses during these times. Conversely, significant negative deviations are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, 3-4 AM), suggesting periods of reduced cardiovascular activity consistent with sleep, though the acrophase of 5:06 PM points to a later peak in activity. Circadian rhythm metrics reveal some irregularities in regularity; 'Interdaily Stability' is above average, suggesting some consistency in daily patterns, but 'Autocorrelation at 24 Hours' is also notably high, potentially indicating a strong but perhaps rigid daily rhythm. Conversely, 'Intradaily Variability' is lower than average, suggesting a less fluctuating heart rate throughout the day, which could be a compensatory mechanism or reflective of a less dynamic physiological state. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes, which is below the population average, coupled with a higher-than-average frequency of mean daily naps. This suggests a potentially disrupted or insufficient sleep pattern, despite a relatively consistent sleep start time standard deviation.

The observed patterns suggest a participant experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, coupled with a generally higher resting heart rate and periods of increased cardiovascular activity in the evenings. Their sleep duration is below average, which is a common correlate of elevated stress. While self-esteem and health satisfaction are not significantly impaired, and substance use is absent, the combination of psychological distress and sleep insufficiency points towards a potentially higher perceived stress load. The correlations provided, though not the sole determinant, offer some guiding insights: CES-D and STAI scores, indicative of negative affect, show positive correlations with PSS, while self-esteem and happiness show negative correlations, as expected. The sleep duration and PSS correlation is negative, suggesting shorter sleep is associated with higher stress, which aligns with the participant's data.

Considering the participant's elevated CES-D and STAI scores, indicating higher levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, and their below-average sleep duration, these factors are likely to contribute to a higher perceived stress level. The population PSS has a median of 22.0. The participant's CES-D score of 19.0 is above the population median (which is not provided but implied by a Z-score of 0.59), and their STAI score of 43.0 is also above the population median (implied by a Z-score of 0.17). Their sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes is below the population average (Z-score of -0.81), and a shorter sleep duration is generally associated with higher perceived stress. While some other indicators like PSQI and self-esteem are favorable, the combination of psychological distress and sleep insufficiency strongly suggests a perceived stress level that would place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

60396,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant's self-reported survey data reveal a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics. Their scores on the STAI (Trait) indicate a moderate level of chronic anxiety, with a Z-score of 0.07, placing them near the population average. This is accompanied by a relatively lower self-esteem score (Z-score of -0.73), suggesting a potential vulnerability in self-worth. While their CES-D score indicates no significant depressive symptoms (Z-score of -0.55), their PSQI score of 6.0 suggests disturbed sleep quality, aligning with the common threshold for clinical significance. Notably, the participant reports a high level of trust in others (Z-score of 1.15) and a moderately high level of current happiness (Z-score of 0.55). In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for both beer and wine/liquor), abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drug use, and exercises with others three times a week or more, indicating a relatively strong social engagement in physical activity. They spend moderate amounts of time on recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, but engage less frequently in reading and listening to music.

The wearable-derived data provides further insights into the participant's physiological and behavioral regularity. Their chronobiological analysis shows a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of 1.57), suggesting a predictable daily pattern. However, the low Intradaily Variability (Z-score of -1.45) points to a potentially flattened daily heart rate fluctuation, which, in conjunction with a low Mesor (Z-score of -1.11) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score of -1.04), may suggest a generally lower physiological arousal level. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate a pattern of increased physiological arousal during the evening and early nighttime hours, particularly between 7-8 PM and 9-10 PM, which then decreases sharply into the early morning hours. This pattern is particularly pronounced in the deviations observed from 3-4 AM to 6-7 AM, where heart rate is significantly below the mesor, suggesting a period of deep rest or low activity. Sleep statistics indicate a slightly longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score of 0.26) and a relatively consistent sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score of -0.66), suggesting a structured sleep schedule.

Considering the provided data in relation to the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population parameters, the participant's profile suggests a potentially higher perceived stress level. While the participant exhibits some positive attributes such as high trust and moderate happiness, the presence of chronic anxiety (STAI), lower self-esteem, and disturbed sleep quality (PSQI) are commonly associated with increased stress. The PSS population distribution indicates a median score of 22.0, with the 75th percentile at 24.0. The correlation data also shows a positive association between anxiety and PSS score (0.31), and a negative association between self-esteem and PSS score (-0.15), as well as sleep quality and PSS score (inferred from PSQI correlation). Although direct PSS scores are not provided, the convergence of these risk factors points towards a higher likelihood of elevated perceived stress. The robust social engagement in exercise and consistent sleep duration might act as moderating factors, but the psychological indicators lean towards a stress level that would likely place the participant in the upper half of the distribution.

92412,16.0,0.04922279792746114,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data present a profile of generally positive psychological functioning and healthy lifestyle habits. Their scores on the CES-D (3.0) and STAI-Trait (32.0) indicate a low burden of depressive symptoms and a non-anxious disposition, respectively. These scores fall within the lower range of the study population, as evidenced by their negative Z-scores (-1.07 and -0.92). Similarly, their self-esteem score (44.0) is above the average, suggesting a positive self-appraisal. Health satisfaction is also reported favorably (5.11), with a positive Z-score (0.63). Substance usage is notably absent across all categories, further contributing to a profile of low-risk behaviors.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data suggest a regulated internal system, though with some notable variations. The participant's resting heart rate (53.0 bpm) is below the population average (Z-score of -0.61), which could indicate good cardiovascular fitness. The Mesor (67.41 bpm) also falls below the population average, suggesting a generally lower baseline heart rate. The circadian rhythm exhibits relatively high intraday variability (0.66, Z-score 0.81) and moderate interdaily stability (0.43, Z-score 0.17), indicating a degree of fluctuation throughout the day but also some consistency. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed around 6:03 PM, aligning with typical evening activity patterns. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (13.08 bpm) is higher than the population average, suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. There is a notable elevation in heart rate deviations during the late afternoon and evening hours, particularly between 5-6 PM (4.19 Z-score) and 6-7 PM (2.17 Z-score), and continuing into the night (e.g., 9-10 PM with a 1.58 Z-score). These periods exhibit significantly higher deviations from the Mesor compared to the population average. Conversely, early morning hours (2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM) show marked decreases in heart rate deviations from the Mesor, suggesting a more subdued physiological state during these times, potentially indicative of sleep or rest. Midday hours (12-1 PM and 1-2 PM) also show significant decreases in deviation from the Mesor, which might reflect periods of lower activity or rest.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally healthy sleep pattern, with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes, slightly longer than the population average (0.76 Z-score). The standard deviation for sleep duration (62 minutes) is below average (-0.87 Z-score), suggesting consistent sleep duration. Sleep start time is also relatively consistent, with a standard deviation of 49 minutes (-0.74 Z-score), and a median start time around midnight. The participant's PSQI score of 4.0 suggests good subjective sleep quality.

Overall, the participant demonstrates positive psychological markers and healthy lifestyle choices, including regular exercise and absence of substance use. Their physiological data indicates a well-regulated circadian rhythm with a lower resting heart rate. However, the elevated heart rate deviations in the late afternoon and evening, coupled with higher intraday variability and amplitude in heart rate, suggest periods of heightened physiological arousal during these times, which could be related to daily stressors or activity patterns not fully captured by other metrics. The absence of strong negative correlations between these physiological metrics and the PSS score suggests that these patterns may not be directly indicative of high perceived stress.

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported psychological measures, including low depression (CESD) and anxiety (STAI) scores, and high self-esteem, suggest a disposition towards lower perceived stress. Their good sleep quality (PSQI) and absence of substance use further support this. While the wearable data reveals periods of elevated heart rate deviations in the evening and higher amplitude, these are not strongly correlated with PSS scores in a manner that would suggest high stress. Furthermore, the relatively stable sleep patterns and average sleep duration do not point towards significant stress-induced sleep disturbances. Given the population mean PSS of 21.63 and the participant's positive psychological indicators and generally healthy lifestyle behaviors, it is likely that their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score falls within the lower half of the study population distribution.

92038,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that warrant careful consideration in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z = -1.18) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 31.0, Z = -1.02), suggesting a foundational psychological resilience. However, a notably high self-esteem score (RSES score of 50.0, Z = 1.66) is incongruent with the interpretation of the scale which suggests higher scores indicate greater self-esteem, potentially indicating an atypical response or a misunderstanding of the scale. Furthermore, subjective happiness is reported at a relatively high level (Z = 1.64). These positive self-perceptions are somewhat countered by a slightly disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI (Score = 6.0, Z = -0.33), a value just above the commonly cited threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, which falls within the average to slightly elevated range relative to the population (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively). Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is robust, with exercising alone and with others reported at a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), suggesting a commitment to physical well-being. Conversely, participation in sports is low (Z = -1.09). Daily recreational habits reveal a preference for passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, with minimal engagement in these (Z-scores of -1.25 and -0.56 respectively). Internet usage is reported as ""16-30 minutes"" (Z = -1.16), and listening to music is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z = -1.19). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours (Z = 0.16), a moderate level. A significant positive correlation exists between reading time and lower perceived stress (Correlation = -0.21), and this participant dedicates a substantial amount of time to reading (16-30 minutes, Z = 1.3).

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a moderately regular circadian rhythm. The mesor (average heart rate adjusted for circadian rhythm) is near the population average (Z = -0.08). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is slightly elevated (Z = 0.99), indicating a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Z = -0.16), suggesting some variability in the day-to-day consistency of the rhythm. Intradaily variability is notably high (Z = 1.23), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate within a 24-hour period. The acrophase, or peak of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 5:12 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (Z = -0.56). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of elevated physiological arousal during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 3-4 PM: Z = 2.24, 4-5 PM: Z = 2.45, 5-6 PM: Z = 0.88, 7-8 PM: Z = 1.16). Conversely, lower than typical heart rates are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z = -0.7, 4-5 AM: Z = -0.75, 6-7 AM: Z = -0.76). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 36 minutes (Z = 0.52), which is slightly above average, though the standard deviation of sleep duration is elevated (Z = 1.0), suggesting variability. The median sleep start time is late (01:27:29), with a moderately high standard deviation (Z = 0.69), pointing to some irregularity in sleep timing. There are no recorded daily naps.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is primarily derived from the participant's self-reported low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, alongside their robust physical activity and moderate social engagement. The positive correlation between reading and lower stress levels, and the participant's dedication to reading, further supports this.

Conversely, evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is suggested by the higher than average amplitude and intraday variability in heart rate, indicating physiological dysregulation. The elevated heart rate deviations during late afternoon and early evening, coinciding with the acrophase, may suggest a heightened physiological response during these periods. While sleep duration is adequate, the irregularity in sleep start times and the variability in sleep duration contribute to potential sleep-related stress. The interpretation of the high self-esteem score needs clarification, but if atypical, it could mask underlying stress. The slightly disturbed sleep quality indicated by the PSQI also leans towards potentially elevated stress.

Holistically, while the participant exhibits traits and behaviors often associated with lower stress, the physiological data, particularly the elevated heart rate variability and specific hourly patterns, alongside some indicators of sleep irregularity, suggest a degree of physiological strain that may contribute to a higher perceived stress level. The strong positive deviations in heart rate during peak activity hours and the irregularities in sleep timing, despite generally positive self-reports on some psychological measures, indicate areas of potential stress. Given the conflicting signals, but with a leaning towards the physiological indicators of potential strain, the participant's PSS score is likely to be in the upper half of the distribution.

Self-esteem is also within the average range, with a score of 37.0 (Z-score: -0.17). The participant reports a moderate level of trust (Score: 3.5, Z-score: 0.5) and a slightly below average level of happiness (Current: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55). Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Score: 4.11, Z-score: -0.12). Academic performance is strong, with a GPA of 3.75 in Fall 2015 and 3.7 in Fall 2016. Substance usage is notably absent, with the participant reporting ""Not at all"" for beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, all with significantly low Z-scores, indicating a lower prevalence of use compared to the study population. Exercise habits are mixed; the participant engages in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91), which is higher than the population average, but exercises alone less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -1.18). Daily recreational habits involve moderate amounts of screen time (Watching TV/Videos/Movies: 16-30 minutes, Video Games: 15 minutes or less, Internet Usage: 1-2 hours) and social activities (Socializing with Friends: 1-2 hours). Reading is reported as ""Do not do,"" which is a lower frequency compared to the population average (Z-score: -0.67).

The participant's sleep patterns, as indicated by the PSQI, suggest disturbed sleep (Score: 7.0, Z-score: 0.13). While the median sleep duration is within the average range at 7 hours and 1 minute (Z-score: -0.21), the standard deviation for sleep duration is within average parameters. A significant finding is the median sleep start time of approximately 12:49 AM, with a relatively low standard deviation for sleep start time (Z-score: -0.7), suggesting a consistent, albeit late, bedtime. There are no reported daily naps. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate of 51.0 bpm (Z-score: -0.85). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a low Mesor (Value: 64.67, Z-score: -1.27) and Amplitude (Value: 8.91, Z-score: -0.6), suggesting a less pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate compared to the population. The acrophase is reported as 4:57 PM. Interdaily stability of heart rate is within the average range (Value: 0.39, Z-score: -0.16), but intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Value: 0.56, Z-score: 0.1). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also slightly elevated (Value: 0.38, Z-score: 0.48), indicating a moderate level of circadian rhythmicity. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of lower than typical heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -9.19 to -19.95) and higher than typical heart rate during the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 1 PM to 8 PM, with deviations ranging from 6.28 to 13.65). Notably, a peak deviation from the mesor occurs between 2-3 PM (13.65).

Considering the available data, the participant's psychological measures (low distress, anxiety, moderate self-esteem) and absence of substance use, along with consistent academic performance, point towards a lower perceived stress level. While there are indicators of disturbed sleep (PSQI score) and a late consistent sleep schedule, these are not strongly correlated with higher PSS scores in this dataset. The physiological data, including resting heart rate and circadian rhythm metrics, do not strongly suggest elevated stress responses. The positive correlations with lower STAI and CES-D scores, and the negative correlations with self-esteem and happiness, further support a profile not indicative of high stress. The overall pattern suggests that the participant likely falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution for perceived stress.

Self-report data indicate a classification of ""anxious"" on the STAI–Trait scale, with a score of 43.0 (Z-score 0.17), suggesting a tendency towards chronic anxiety proneness that is slightly above the population average. Conversely, the CES-D score of 13.0 (Z-score -0.03) suggests a low burden of depressive symptoms, falling within the ""Not depressed"" classification and close to the population mean. Self-esteem is reported as high, with a score of 40.0, the maximum on the scale, indicating strong self-worth. Trust in others is also relatively high, with a Z-score of 0.83. Happiness is reported as moderately high (Z-score 0.55). Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.22).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a higher than average frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 1.23) and engaging in sports (Z-score 0.91), indicating active social and physical engagement. However, beer consumption is notably high, occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.72), while wine or liquor consumption is moderate (""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score 0.94). Recreational drug usage is low (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score 1.61), and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-score -0.11). Daily activity patterns show significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and playing video games (31 minutes to 1 hour, Z-score 1.71), while time spent reading and listening to music is notably low. Internet usage is below average, and sedentary hobbies are also limited.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal certain characteristics. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate stability, with an Interdaily Stability value of 0.46 (Z-score 0.42). Intradaily Variability is relatively low at 0.5 (Z-score -0.32), suggesting a degree of regularity in daily fluctuations. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is notably low at 0.19 (Z-score -1.12), indicating a weaker than average tendency for daily patterns to repeat consistently. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is below population average (Z-score -0.55), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is close to average (Z-score 0.04). The resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score -0.73). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates significant elevations during the evening hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (Z-score 2.12) and 8-9 PM (Z-score 0.68), suggesting physiological arousal during these periods. Conversely, significant negative deviations (indicating lower heart rate than expected) are observed during the morning hours, from approximately 2 AM to 10 AM. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score -1.25), which is below average, and a median sleep start time of 4:31 AM, which is significantly earlier than typical (indicated by the Z-score for sleep duration standard deviation and sleep start time standard deviation are not directly interpretable without context, but the mean sleep duration is a strong indicator of insufficient sleep). Napping behavior is minimal (Z-score -0.86). The PSQI score of 7.0 suggests ""Disturbed Sleep,"" which is consistent with the shorter sleep duration.

Considering the available data, the participant's elevated anxiety trait (STAI), significantly reduced sleep duration, and reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI) are key indicators that might correlate with higher perceived stress. While high self-esteem and trust might be protective factors, the combination of anxiety, poor sleep, and specific behavioral patterns (high alcohol and video game use, low sleep duration) suggests a potential for elevated stress. The population PSS mean is 21.62, with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. The participant's anxiety score, alongside the objective sleep data, suggests that their perceived stress may lean towards the higher end of the distribution.

Sedentary hobbies occupy 1-2 hours daily (Z-score 1.41).

Wearable data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, indicated by moderate interdaily stability (Value 0.45, Z-score 0.33) and high intradaily variability (Value 0.64, Z-score 0.67) in heart rate. The mesor, representing the average heart rate around which daily rhythms oscillate, is 74.34 bpm (Z-score 0.05), which is close to the population mean. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 12.42 bpm (Z-score 0.53), indicating a moderate daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:54 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly below average at 54.2 bpm (Z-score -0.47).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. Notably, there are pronounced negative deviations (indicating heart rates below the average for that time) during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 7 AM, with the most significant deviations occurring between 5 AM and 7 AM (Z-scores -1.11 and -0.73 respectively). This suggests a state of low physiological arousal during these periods, which aligns with typical sleep patterns. As the morning progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, indicating increasing arousal. A notable peak in positive deviation occurs between 6 PM and 8 PM (Z-scores 1.65 and 0.52), suggesting elevated physiological activity during the evening, which may be influenced by daily routines or environmental factors.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score -1.41), which is below the population average, and a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Value '133 minutes', Z-score 0.74), suggesting inconsistency. The median sleep start time is late at 1:47 AM, with a considerable standard deviation (Value '135 minutes', Z-score 1.14), further highlighting irregular sleep timing. The participant also reports a low average daily nap frequency (Value 0.07, Z-score -0.08). The correlation between intraday variability of heart rate and PSS score is positive (0.16), suggesting that greater fluctuations in hourly heart rate may be associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, correlations for sleep duration and sleep start time deviations with PSS are also positive (0.05 and 0.17 respectively), indicating that shorter or more variable sleep patterns might be linked to increased stress.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, they report moderate trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.37) and disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score -0.33). The sleep statistics from the wearable data reveal a pattern of insufficient and inconsistent sleep, with shorter median sleep durations and significant variability in sleep start times. These factors are often associated with elevated stress. Furthermore, the positive correlations observed between intraday heart rate variability and sleep duration/start time variability with the PSS score (0.16, 0.05, and 0.17 respectively) suggest that physiological and behavioral patterns indicative of irregularity and potential strain are present.

However, several factors point towards a potentially lower or average perceived stress level. The participant reports no substance usage, has a moderate self-esteem (Z-score -0.59), and relatively low trust levels (Z-score -0.78), which, while not indicative of high stress on their own, do not strongly suggest significant distress. Their GPA is reasonable, indicating academic functioning. The PSS population mean is 21.62 with a median of 22.0. Without the participant's specific PSS score, a definitive classification is challenging.

Considering the available data, the presence of disturbed sleep, moderate trait anxiety, and physiological/behavioral irregularities associated with sleep are significant indicators that could contribute to higher perceived stress. While not exhibiting extreme negative psychological markers, the combination of these factors suggests a propensity for the participant to fall within the upper half of the perceived stress distribution. The negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with PSS, and the positive correlations of anxiety and PSS, though moderate, further support this leaning.

28653,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant presents with a unique profile characterized by generally positive psychological self-assessments and a number of notably higher-than-average lifestyle and behavioral metrics. Their self-reported anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.22) and depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score of -0.76) are below the population mean, suggesting a lower proneness to these specific psychological states. This is further supported by high self-esteem (RSES Z-score of 1.52) and a high level of general happiness (Current Happiness Z-score of 1.64), indicating a positive self-perception and emotional outlook. Furthermore, this individual reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 1.63).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in more frequent exercise with others (Exercised with Others Z-score of 1.23) and exhibits higher than average interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.40) in their heart rate data. This suggests a more regular daily structure in their physiological rhythms. However, their intradaily variability (Z-score of -2.08) is significantly lower than the population mean, indicating a less dynamic or less reactive cardiovascular system throughout the day. Their sleep duration is also notably longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of 1.1), although the start time exhibits some variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of 0.53).

Despite the generally positive psychological and some healthy behavioral indicators, there are also elements that warrant closer examination. The participant's Mesor (mean heart rate around the rhythm) is very close to the population average (Z-score of 0.05), but their Amplitude (variation around the Mesor) is substantially higher (Z-score of 2.26). This indicates a larger range of heart rate fluctuation throughout the day relative to their average. This heightened amplitude is particularly evident during specific afternoon and early evening hours, with the 3-4 PM slot showing the highest deviation from the Mesor (Z-score of 3.82), followed by the 4-5 PM slot (Z-score of 2.10). The acrophase (peak time of heart rate) occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:42 PM), aligning with these periods of elevated heart rate.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported data indicates relatively low levels of anxiety and depression, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, and good physical health satisfaction. These psychological factors generally correlate negatively with perceived stress, suggesting a potential for a lower PSS score. The observed regularity in their circadian rhythms (high Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours) and longer sleep duration also lean towards a more balanced physiological state, which typically corresponds with lower stress.

However, the significantly elevated amplitude of their heart rate (Z-score of 2.26), particularly the pronounced peaks in the late afternoon and early evening, suggests periods of significant physiological arousal that could be indicative of stress responses. The strong correlation between Amplitude and PSS score (correlation of -0.17) suggests that while higher amplitude may be associated with lower PSS, the nature of these fluctuations, especially the late afternoon peak, might be an underlying indicator of stress that is not fully captured by the psychological self-report measures alone.

Considering the population's PSS distribution, where the median is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, the absence of significant self-reported psychological distress and the presence of stable rhythms point towards a PSS score that is likely not in the extreme upper range. While the heightened heart rate amplitude in the afternoon is a notable physiological indicator, it is not strongly correlated with PSS in a way that would definitively place the participant in the top 50%. The overall pattern suggests a participant who, despite some physiological responses indicative of arousal during specific times of the day, generally maintains a positive psychological outlook and structured lifestyle, likely placing them in the lower half of the perceived stress distribution.

95559,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant's data presents a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological markers, offering insights into their perceived stress levels. Self-reported measures indicate a generally low level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.22) and a moderate frequency of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.55), suggesting a stable psychological baseline. Self-esteem is reported as relatively high (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.96), and there is a positive outlook on personal health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.53). Trust in others is also reported at an average level (Trust Z-score: 0.18). While not explicitly measured for PSS, these metrics suggest a participant who is not experiencing overwhelming negative affect or low self-regard.

Lifestyle behaviors reveal a pattern of moderate substance use, with beer consumption occurring three times a week or more (Beer Z-score: 1.72), and wine or liquor consumed one to two times a week (Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring one to two times a week both alone and with others, and sports participation one to two times a month. Daily leisure activities are varied, with a significant amount of time dedicated to listening to music (2-3 hours), followed by watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes/hour) and internet usage (1-2 hours). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data highlights some irregularities in the participant's circadian rhythm and sleep patterns. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.98), suggesting a lack of consistent daily rhythmicity, and intradaily variability is also low (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -1.8), which can indicate periods of inactivity or less dynamic physiological responses throughout the day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also lower than average (Amplitude Z-score: -1.16), potentially reflecting reduced physiological variation over the 24-hour cycle. Sleep duration, while slightly below average at a median of 6 hours and 39 minutes (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.66), exhibits a high daily variability in nap frequency (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 2.07), suggesting a disrupted sleep schedule. The average resting heart rate is within a normal range, and the mean hourly deviations from the mesor show a pattern of elevated heart rate during the evening hours, peaking between 7-8 PM, followed by a gradual decrease into the early morning hours. The late sleep start time (Median Sleep Start Time: 02:10:59) further indicates a significant disruption in the typical sleep-wake cycle.

Considering the overall data, the participant exhibits characteristics that may contribute to elevated perceived stress, despite generally positive self-reported psychological states. The lower interdaily stability and intradaily variability in heart rate, coupled with a below-average sleep duration and a significantly late sleep start time, point towards physiological dysregulation that is often associated with stress. The high frequency of beer consumption also warrants consideration as a potential coping mechanism or indicator of underlying stress. While self-reported anxiety and depression are low, the physiological markers suggest a potential disconnect between subjective well-being and objective physiological functioning, which can be a precursor to or indicator of increased perceived stress. The moderate levels of exercise and socialization are positive indicators, but the overall picture suggests a pattern of disrupted daily rhythms and potentially unhealthy coping behaviors.

The participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported traits and behaviors, alongside objective wearable data, which collectively inform their perceived stress levels. Self-report measures indicate a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and a slightly below-average level of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 41.0, Z-score -0.03). Self-esteem is also noted to be within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 36.0, Z-Score -0.31), alongside a tendency towards slightly lower trust of others (Trust score of 3.0, Z-Score -0.46) and lower self-reported happiness (Happy score of 3.0, Z-Score -0.53). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (PSQI score of 7.0, Z-Score 0.13), suggesting potential issues with sleep hygiene or continuity.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports moderate engagement in social drinking (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score 0.94) but abstains from other substance use. They engage in regular solitary exercise (Exercised Alone: Three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.07) but have minimal engagement in exercising with others or sports. Daily recreational activities are characterized by significant screen time, including watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-Score 1.28) and moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score 0.85). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies. Their sleep patterns, as indicated by wearable data, reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes (Z-Score -0.48), which is slightly shorter than average, and a median sleep start time around 2:28 AM, with considerable variability in both duration and start time (standard deviations of 118 minutes and 102 minutes respectively).

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z-Score -1.04). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a low Mesor (62.67, Z-Score -1.54), suggesting a generally lower average heart rate, and a near-average amplitude (10.59, Z-Score -0.06). The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 5:17 PM. The pattern of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor highlights notable periods of elevated heart rate deviations during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 4-5 PM, Z-Score 2.34; 5-6 PM, Z-Score 1.95), which then subsides into lower deviations during the night. Conversely, there are marked dips in heart rate deviation during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM). The intradaily variability of heart rate is within the average range (0.54, Z-Score -0.04), but interdaily stability is lower than average (0.35, Z-Score -0.49), suggesting less consistency in daily heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also notably low (-1.45 Z-score), indicating poor regularity in daily heart rate cycles.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score falls within a range that requires careful consideration of the available multimodal data. The population PSS mean is 21.61 with a standard deviation of 3.68, placing the 50th percentile at 22.0. This participant's overall PSS score is not directly provided, but we must infer its position relative to the population distribution based on the accompanying self-reported, behavioral, and physiological data, particularly their correlations with PSS.

Evidence supporting a **low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile)** includes relatively low scores on measures of depression (CES-D) and below-average chronic anxiety (STAI). Their self-esteem and happiness levels are also within the average to slightly below-average range, which can be indicative of lower stress. Furthermore, the participant engages in solitary exercise, which is generally a stress-reducing behavior. Their trust levels are also lower than average, which can sometimes correlate with lower perceived interpersonal stress. The negative correlations with reading and sedentary hobbies are also worth noting, suggesting that higher engagement in these might be associated with lower stress.

Conversely, evidence for a **high PSS score (top 50th percentile)** emerges from several aspects. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 7.0), which is a significant correlate of elevated stress. Their sleep duration is slightly shorter than average and demonstrates considerable variability in timing and duration, suggesting potential disruptions that could contribute to higher stress. The higher-than-average engagement in social drinking, while not indicative of problematic use, can sometimes be an indirect coping mechanism associated with stress. More significantly, the physiological data shows periods of marked elevation in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late afternoon and evening, a pattern that, when sustained, can be indicative of higher physiological arousal and stress. The low interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate suggest a lack of regularity in daily physiological rhythms, which is often associated with stress.

Holistically, while the participant exhibits some indicators of lower psychological distress (e.g., CES-D, STAI), the combination of disturbed sleep quality, irregular sleep patterns, and notable physiological arousal patterns (elevated heart rate deviations in the evening) suggests a significant contribution to perceived stress. The PSQI score of 7.0, with a Z-score of 0.13, is indicative of disturbed sleep, and this metric has a positive correlation with PSS. The data points towards an individual who may be experiencing internal conflict or challenges in managing their daily rhythms and physiological responses, which is highly congruent with elevated perceived stress. Given the cumulative weight of the disturbed sleep and physiological markers of arousal, it is more likely that the participant's PSS score falls into the **top 50th percentile**.

59592,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that warrant careful consideration in relation to their perceived stress. Self-report data indicate a tendency towards anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI-Trait score that classifies the individual as ""anxious"" and holds a Z-score of 0.46, suggesting a slightly elevated proneness to chronic anxiety compared to the study population. This aligns with a moderately positive correlation (0.31) between STAI scores and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores. While not classified as depressed, the CES-D score of 14.0 is within the typical range for experiencing some depressive symptoms, with a mild positive correlation (0.28) to PSS scores. Conversely, self-esteem is reported at a score of 35.0, which is above the average range for the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), indicating generally positive self-worth and a slight negative correlation (-0.15) with PSS. Health satisfaction is also reported slightly below average (3.67), with a weak negative correlation (-0.08) to PSS.

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed profile. The participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week), which is notably higher than the population average (Z-score of 0.94). Recreational drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise habits indicate a pattern of exercising alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32), but infrequent exercise with others or participation in sports (Z-scores of -0.88 and -1.09, respectively). Sedentary leisure activities are prominent, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85). Listening to music also occupies a notable portion of time (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.67). Notably, activities associated with reading and video games are less frequent. Daily recreation habits generally show weak correlations with PSS scores, with the exception of reading (correlation -0.21).

Physiological data from wearable devices suggest some irregularities in circadian rhythmicity and activity patterns. The intradaily variability of heart rate is elevated (Value 0.78, Z-score 1.65), indicating a more fluctuating heart rate throughout the day, which is positively correlated with PSS (0.16). Conversely, interdaily stability is low (Value 0.3, Z-score -0.9), suggesting a lack of consistent daily patterns. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is slightly elevated (Value 77.31, Z-score 0.46), and the resting heart rate is also above average (Value 66.1, Z-score 0.95), with a moderate positive correlation to PSS (0.14). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably low (Value 6.93, Z-score -1.25), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate, which is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.16). Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of heightened deviation from the Mesor during the late night and early morning hours (3-6 AM), with Z-scores reaching up to 1.1. These periods of higher arousal during sleep, coupled with a low amplitude, may indicate disrupted sleep architecture. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes, slightly below average (Z-score -0.29), and a median sleep start time of 01:49:00, with a relatively tight sleep start time standard deviation (39 minutes, Z-score -0.97). The PSQI score of 5.0 suggests a borderline indication of clinically significant sleep disturbance, though its Z-score of -0.8 indicates it is below the population mean.

Considering the elevated anxiety proneness, the tendency for some depressive symptoms, and the physiological indicators of disrupted circadian rhythmicity and elevated heart rate during sleep, along with sedentary behaviors, it is likely that this participant experiences a higher level of perceived stress. The positive correlations between anxiety, heart rate variability during sleep, and PSS further support this interpretation.

89652,28.0,0.961139896373057,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological and behavioral data with wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics to interpret perceived stress within a university student population. The participant's psychological profile indicates generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.86) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62), coupled with a relatively high self-esteem score (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.82). Furthermore, this individual reports high levels of trust (Trust Z-score: 2.75) and happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64), suggesting a positive psychological disposition. Lifestyle behaviors are characterized by complete abstinence from substance usage, with infrequent engagement in exercising alone or with others (1-2 times a month), although regular participation in sports (1-2 times a week) is noted. Daily recreational habits indicate minimal engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with moderate internet usage and socializing with friends, and limited time spent on reading and sedentary hobbies. The participant's body mass index (18.14) falls within the underweight range.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a mesor (mean heart rate value around the daily average) of 72.97 bpm, which is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.13). The amplitude of their heart rate variation is also within the typical range (Z-score: -0.05), and their acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurs in the late afternoon (4:37 PM). The resting heart rate is slightly above average for the population (60.3 bpm, Z-score: 0.26). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of increased cardiovascular activity during the afternoon and early evening hours, peaking between 3-4 PM (deviation: 17.84, Z-score: 1.61), which aligns with the acrophase. Conversely, the participant shows marked decreases in heart rate deviation during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 3-6 AM, indicative of physiological rest and sleep.

Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a moderate level of interdaily stability (Value: 0.43, Z-score: 0.17), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns, but also a relatively high intradaily variability (Value: 0.73, Z-score: 1.3). This higher variability might reflect responses to daily activities or external stimuli. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.22, Z-score: -0.87) is lower than average, potentially indicating a less consistent daily rhythm across multiple days. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.76). The standard deviation for sleep duration is notably high (172 minutes, Z-score: 1.62), suggesting considerable nightly variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is quite late (02:54:29), with a moderately high standard deviation (106 minutes, Z-score: 0.51). The participant also reports a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Value: 0.2, Z-score: 1.49). Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Score: 4.0, Z-Score: -1.26), which contrasts with the objective sleep duration variability.

Considering the overall data, the participant exhibits positive psychological traits and generally healthy lifestyle habits, including no substance use and moderate engagement in physical activity and social interaction. However, their sleep patterns are characterized by shorter duration and significant variability, coupled with a late sleep onset. While many psychological measures suggest a low baseline stress, the inconsistent sleep duration and high intradaily variability in heart rate could be contributing factors to perceived stress. The moderate correlation observed between Intradaily Variability (0.15) and the PSS score, and the negative correlation between Self-Esteem (-0.16) and Sleep Duration Standard Deviation (0.13) suggest potential indirect links. Given the population's PSS score distribution (median 22.0, 75th percentile 24.0), the participant's characteristics, particularly the suboptimal sleep patterns, might elevate their stress levels relative to those with more regular sleep.

Based on the analysis of the multimodal data, the participant's sleep characteristics, specifically the shorter median sleep duration and high variability in sleep duration, alongside a late sleep start time, suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. While their self-reported psychological well-being and lifestyle choices are generally positive, these sleep metrics are often associated with increased stress. Considering the population distribution, where the median PSS is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, the evidence for potentially compromised sleep structure points towards a PSS score that may fall within the upper half of the distribution.

28724,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a psychological profile characterized by moderate levels of trait anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 40.0, which is slightly below the population mean but falls within the classification of ""anxious."" This is accompanied by a low score on the CES-D depression scale (6.0), suggesting a low frequency of depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is high, with a score of 39.0, just slightly above the population average. Happiness levels are notably elevated (Z-score 1.64), indicating a strong positive subjective well-being. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.2), while trust in others is marginally above average. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 6.0, slightly below the population average, suggesting some subjective difficulties with sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week), but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drug use. They demonstrate a commitment to physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more, though exercising with others and participation in sports are less frequent. Daily recreational habits include a substantial amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour) and moderate internet usage (1-2 hours). They also report listening to music for 31 minutes an hour, socializing with friends for 1-2 hours, and engaging in reading for a short duration. Sedentary hobbies are also practiced for 16-30 minutes daily.

From a physiological perspective, the participant exhibits a resting heart rate of 59.8, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.2). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, significant positive deviations, suggesting elevated heart rate relative to the circadian rhythm, are observed during the late morning and early afternoon, specifically between 11 AM and 1 PM (Z-score 1.71 for 11-12 PM) and again from 1 PM to 2 PM (Z-score 2.1 for 1-2 PM). This period of increased cardiovascular activity may correlate with periods of higher cognitive demand or stress. Conversely, during nighttime hours, heart rate deviations are consistently negative, indicating lower than average heart rate during sleep, with pronounced decreases observed between 10 PM and 2 AM.

Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a degree of regularity. Interdaily stability is low (0.32, Z-score -0.74), suggesting some variability in daily rhythmicity. Conversely, intraday variability is high (0.76, Z-score 1.51), implying significant fluctuations in heart rate within a 24-hour period, which aligns with the observed pronounced deviations from the mesor. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.19, Z-score -1.12), further supporting less consistent daily patterns. The mesor of 70.67 is below the population average, and the amplitude of 9.02 is also lower than average, suggesting a less pronounced overall daily variation in heart rate compared to the population norm. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 3:31 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes, which is longer than the population average (Z-score 0.79). However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively low (65 minutes, Z-score -0.81), suggesting consistent sleep duration. Sleep start times are notably consistent, with a standard deviation of 28 minutes (Z-score -1.22), and the median sleep start time is close to midnight. The participant reports very few daily naps.

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The population PSS scores range from a mean of 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68. The 50th percentile (median) is 22.0, and the 75th percentile is 24.0. This indicates that a score above 22.0 would place an individual in the top 50% of the study population, representing relatively elevated perceived stress.

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes a high self-esteem score (39.0) and significantly high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64). These factors are generally associated with lower perceived stress. The participant also reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D score 6.0), which is also indicative of a less stressed state. Furthermore, the participant exhibits consistent sleep durations and a stable sleep start time, which can contribute to better stress management.

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is less direct but can be inferred from certain physiological and behavioral patterns. The classification of ""anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score 40.0) suggests a predisposition to experiencing stress. The high intraday variability in heart rate (Z-score 1.51) and significant positive deviations from the mesor during waking hours, particularly in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM-2 PM), could reflect periods of heightened physiological arousal and potential stress responses. The subjective classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" on the PSQI, despite a longer average sleep duration, suggests that sleep quality may be compromised, which is often linked to elevated stress. Additionally, a considerable amount of time spent on sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies, while not directly indicative of stress, may suggest limited engagement in stress-reducing activities.

Holistically, the presence of a trait anxiety classification, coupled with physiological indicators of heightened arousal during the day and subjectively reported disturbed sleep, weighs against a low or median PSS score. While high self-esteem and happiness are protective factors, the combination of anxiety proneness and physiological signs of elevated arousal suggest that this participant is more likely to fall into the higher range of perceived stress within the study population. The consistent sleep patterns and low depressive symptoms are positive but do not entirely negate the influence of other factors that may contribute to higher stress perception.

Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.34) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.33), alongside a healthy level of self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: -0.31). This suggests a baseline psychological resilience. However, subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is indicated as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), aligning with a classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" This may represent an area of vulnerability.

Behaviorally, the participant reports engaging in substance use (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a week), which is above average for the population (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). Conversely, their engagement in solitary exercise and exercise with others is notably low (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.93, Exercised with Others Z-score: -1.58), while participation in sports is around average (Sports Z-score: 0.91). Leisure time is heavily dedicated to activities that involve passive consumption or extended screen time, with particularly high reported durations for listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06), socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.53), and internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score: 1.52). This pattern suggests a significant portion of their free time is spent in sedentary or digitally mediated activities, with less emphasis on physical exertion.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as assessed by wearable data, shows moderate regularity. Interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly below average (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.24), suggesting some variability in daily routines. Intraday variability is also lower than average (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -0.74), which might indicate a less dynamic cardiovascular response throughout the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below population average (Mesor Z-score: -0.31), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is close to average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.2). The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is observed in the late afternoon (4:43 PM), which is a typical pattern. The resting heart rate is below the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.26).

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal across the day. The participant exhibits pronounced deviations below the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: -0.57, 4-5 AM Z-score: -0.70), suggesting a period of reduced physiological activity during these times, likely aligned with sleep. Following this, there is a notable increase in positive deviations (indicating elevated heart rate relative to the mesor) in the morning and afternoon, particularly between 9-10 AM (Z-score: 0.80) and again in the evening, with the most significant positive deviations observed between 7-8 PM (Z-score: 1.15). This pattern indicates periods of higher cardiovascular demand or arousal during the typical waking hours, with notable peaks in the late evening.

Sleep statistics from the wearable data indicate a generally sufficient sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.01), which is above average. However, there is a high degree of variability in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.05), suggesting a less consistent sleep schedule. The lack of daily naps is consistent with the average sleep duration.

Given the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score appears to align with the lower half of the study population distribution. While there are indicators of potential vulnerability, such as disturbed subjective sleep quality and a tendency towards sedentary leisure activities and higher-than-average substance use, these are offset by generally low scores in self-reported anxiety and depression, and a relatively healthy self-esteem. The physiological data indicates a somewhat regular, albeit not perfectly stable, circadian rhythm with periods of lower arousal during sleep and elevated arousal during waking hours, which is not inherently indicative of high stress. The robust sleep duration, despite variability in start times, is also a positive indicator. The weak correlations observed between these metrics and the PSS score further support the interpretation that these factors, in isolation, do not strongly predict elevated stress. Therefore, the overall evidence suggests a PSS score that falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

44927,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with several noteworthy psychological and behavioral characteristics. Self-reported data indicate a generally low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.76) and average anxiety proneness (STAI-Trait score of 40.0, Z-score of -0.13), aligning with the ""anxious"" classification but within a range that suggests no significant clinical concern. Self-esteem is within the higher range of the scale (Score of 32.0, Z-score of -0.87), while self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53). Health satisfaction is also reported as moderately high (Score of 3.67, Z-score of -0.45). Notably, the participant demonstrates high trust in others (Trust score of 3.83, Z-score of 1.15), a trait that often correlates with positive social interactions and well-being. Regarding lifestyle, substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, with significantly lower Z-scores than the population, indicating very low or absent substance use. Exercise habits reveal a dichotomy: infrequent solitary exercise (Frequency 'Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score of -1.18) and no exercise with others (Frequency 'Not at all', Z-score of -1.58), contrasting with frequent participation in sports (Frequency 'Three times a week or more', Z-score of 1.58). Daily recreation includes moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.18) and significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score of 1.13), while activities like watching TV/videos and reading are reported as ""Do not do"" or minimal.

Wearable-derived metrics provide further insight into the participant's physiological rhythms and sleep patterns. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals moderate interdaily stability (Value of 0.39, Z-score of -0.16) and intradaily variability (Value of 0.52, Z-score of -0.18), suggesting a reasonably regular but not exceptionally rigid daily rhythm. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:34 PM). The mesor, representing the average daily heart rate, is slightly below the population average (Value of 71.56, Z-score of -0.33), as is the amplitude (Value of 9.58, Z-score of -0.39), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the average. Resting heart rate is notably low (Value of 54.6, Z-score of -0.42), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.30 to -0.86) and a marked increase in heart rate during the late morning and early afternoon, peaking between 9-10 AM (Z-score of 0.91) and 2-3 PM (Z-score of 0.67), which aligns with the observed acrophase. This pattern suggests increased physiological arousal during typical waking and active hours. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below average (Z-score of -0.77), and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Median 00:59:30, Z-score of 0.23). The standard deviation of sleep duration is also lower than average (Value of 66 minutes, Z-score of -0.79), suggesting some consistency in sleep timing despite the shorter duration.

Considering the participant's self-reported data and wearable metrics in relation to perceived stress, the overall PSS score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population. Evidence for a lower perceived stress level includes low scores on the CES-D (depressive symptoms) and a moderate STAI-Trait score, indicating no significant anxiety or depression. High self-esteem and moderate happiness contribute to a positive psychological baseline. The participant's engagement in sports, moderate internet and music listening habits, and very low substance use are indicative of healthy lifestyle choices, which can buffer stress. While sleep duration is slightly below average, the PSQI classification as ""Good Sleep"" and the relatively stable sleep start times suggest that sleep quality may not be a significant stressor. Furthermore, the low resting heart rate and mesor suggest good physiological regulation. Although there are periods of elevated heart rate during the day, these are within expected ranges for activity and do not appear to be indicative of chronic hyperarousal. The correlations provided are generally weak and do not consistently point towards a high PSS score across multiple domains. For instance, the negative correlation with self-esteem and happiness, and the weak positive correlation with anxiety symptoms, are not strong enough to override the other indicators of lower stress. The moderate interdaily stability of heart rate suggests a structured daily routine, which can be stress-reducing.

71894,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant presents with several indicators suggestive of elevated psychological distress. Self-reported measures reveal high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 34.0, Z-score 2.15) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 64.0, Z-score 2.24). These are further corroborated by a notably low self-esteem score (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, 19.0, Z-score -2.7), indicating a negative self-perception which often co-occurs with heightened stress. While the participant reports generally disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 6.0, Z-score -0.33, classified as disturbed sleep), the Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes, which is below the average for the study population (Z-score -0.58), suggesting potential objective sleep deficits contributing to subjective complaints.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a pattern of high internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and extensive music listening (Z-score 2.06), alongside significant socializing with friends (Z-score 1.74). Conversely, sedentary hobbies and recreational activities such as watching TV, video games, and reading are engaged in less frequently, suggesting a preference for more active or socially engaging digital and interpersonal pursuits. Physical activity is relatively high, with exercise occurring alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), although participation in sports is notably absent (Z-score -1.09). Substance usage is minimal, with infrequent beer consumption and no reported use of wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively stable and regular heart rate pattern across the day, as suggested by a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score 0.5) and intradaily variability (Z-score 0.81). The mesor (average heart rate level) is within the study population's range (Z-score 0.95), with a resting heart rate also appearing to be at a moderate level (Value 63.6, Z-score 0.65). However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a marked elevation during the morning hours, specifically between 6-7 AM (Z-score 4.44) and 7-8 AM (Z-score 4.61), followed by a notable dip in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, Z-score -1.88). This pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate, with a significant morning spike and a late-night trough, might reflect an exaggerated physiological response to the anticipated demands of the day or a disrupted sleep-wake cycle. The acrophase occurring at 2:33 PM further contributes to this pattern of an active day with significant physiological fluctuations.

Given the strong indicators of elevated anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, coupled with a below-average sleep duration, this participant likely experiences a higher level of perceived stress. The self-reported psychological distress measures (CES-D, STAI) are significantly above the population mean, and these often correlate with higher PSS scores. While some behavioral factors like higher physical activity and moderate social engagement might be considered adaptive, they do not appear to fully mitigate the underlying psychological burden. The pronounced morning heart rate elevation and late-night dip further suggest physiological dysregulation that could be linked to stress. Therefore, it is probable that this participant's Perceived Stress Scale score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

30453,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a potentially elevated level of perceived stress. Self-reported measures reveal a high burden of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 31.0, which is 1.84 standard deviations above the mean and classified as ""Depressed."" Concurrently, trait anxiety is also elevated, with a STAI score of 51.0, 1.96 standard deviations above the mean, and classified as ""anxious."" Subjective sleep quality is notably poor, evidenced by a PSQI score of 16.0, 4.29 standard deviations above the mean, and classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" Conversely, self-esteem appears to be below average, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 27.0, 1.57 standard deviations below the mean. Happiness is also reported as low, with a score of 2.0, 1.61 standard deviations below the mean, and health satisfaction is also below average.

Behavioral patterns indicate a substantial engagement in activities that may reflect coping mechanisms or lifestyle choices influenced by stress. The participant reports listening to music for more than 4 hours daily (Z-score of 2.06) and significant time spent reading (Z-score of 2.28). Conversely, engagement in sports is high, with frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score of 1.58). Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level (""31 minutes an hour,"" Z-score of -0.62). Notably, there is no reported usage of alcohol, wine, liquor, or recreational drugs. The participant also engages in exercise with others more frequently than the average (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score of 1.23).

Wearable data presents a mixed picture regarding circadian rhythm regularity. Interdaily stability (IS) of heart rate, a measure of daily rhythmicity, is relatively low at 0.3 (Z-score of -0.9), suggesting less consistent daily patterns. However, intradaily variability (IV), reflecting the complexity of activity within a day, is slightly elevated at 0.63 (Z-score of 0.6), potentially indicating more fluctuating physiological states. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate level, is slightly elevated at 80.18 (Z-score of 0.85). The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 3:51 PM. Resting heart rate is also elevated at 67.5 bpm (Z-score of 1.11).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pattern of increased physiological arousal during waking hours, particularly in the morning and late afternoon/early evening. Notably, there are significant positive deviations from the Mesor between 6-7 AM (Z-score 1.53), 7-8 AM (Z-score 1.08), and 8-9 AM (Z-score 1.02), as well as between 4-5 PM (Z-score 0.5) and 5-6 PM (Z-score 0.06). Conversely, during sleep hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score -0.77), heart rate deviations are largely negative, indicating a reduction in heart rate as expected. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 25 minutes, which is below average (Z-score of -0.96), and a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of 1.0), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:21:00.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data indicates a constellation of factors associated with elevated perceived stress. High scores on the CES-D and STAI scales, coupled with severely disturbed sleep (PSQI) and low self-esteem and happiness, are strong indicators of psychological distress. The high prevalence of listening to music and reading as daily activities, while potentially beneficial, could also represent a strategy to manage internal distress or escape from stressors. The elevated resting heart rate and the observed patterns of increased heart rate during key daily periods, alongside a shorter and more variable sleep duration, further support the presence of physiological stress responses. While the participant does not engage in substance use and has moderate to high engagement in exercise and sports, these positive behaviors are offset by significant psychological and sleep-related challenges. Considering the strong convergence of multiple indicators pointing towards distress, it is likely that this participant's perceived stress level would fall in the upper half of the study population distribution.

66047,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret perceived stress levels within a university student population. The participant exhibits elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of 3.4) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of 3.13), both of which are significant positive correlations with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores (0.28 and 0.31 respectively). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score of -2.42) with a weak negative correlation to PSS scores (-0.15), suggesting that lower self-worth may be associated with lower perceived stress in this instance, though this effect is modest. Overall satisfaction with physical health is also low (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -2.28), with a slight negative correlation to PSS scores (-0.07).

Behavioral patterns indicate excessive engagement in sedentary leisure activities. The participant spends more than 4 hours daily watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 3.17) and more than 4 hours on the internet (Z-score of 2.19), with positive correlations to PSS scores of 0.04 and 0.1 respectively. Conversely, exercise habits are minimal, with infrequent participation in exercising alone (Frequency 'Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score -1.18) and no reported exercise with others or sports participation (Z-scores -1.58 and -1.09 respectively), showing minor negative correlations with PSS scores. Reading is also not a regular activity (Frequency 'Do not do', Z-score -0.67), with a moderate negative correlation to PSS scores (-0.21). Substance usage is generally low, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, and infrequent alcohol consumption.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals a resting heart rate of 68.4 bpm (Z-score 1.22), which is above the population average. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates elevated cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours, specifically from 12 AM to 7 AM, with peak positive deviations observed between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM (Z-scores 1.18 and 0.94 respectively). This pattern suggests a potential disruption in the typical diurnal heart rate rhythm, which is further supported by the PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (Z-score 1.52). Sleep duration is adequate on average (Median Sleep Duration '7 hours 15 minutes', Z-score 0.08), but there is a notable frequency of naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score of 2.4), and the median sleep start time is unusually late at approximately 2:40 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score 0.03). The circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Value 0.43, Z-score 0.17) and intradaily variability (Value 0.58, Z-score 0.24), are within typical ranges and show weak negative and positive correlations with PSS, respectively. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 6:35 PM.

The participant presents with a significant symptom profile characterized by high levels of depression and anxiety, coupled with low self-esteem and low health satisfaction. These psychological markers are generally associated with higher perceived stress. While sedentary behaviors like excessive screen time show moderate positive correlations with PSS, the lack of engagement in physical activity and reading correlates negatively. The observed physiological data, including elevated resting heart rate and unusual late-night/early-morning heart rate deviations, alongside a late and variable sleep schedule, are consistent with a state of heightened physiological arousal which could contribute to perceived stress. The PSQI classification of disturbed sleep also aligns with this. Considering the strong indicators of psychological distress (anxiety, depression) and the physiological patterns suggestive of dysregulation, it is plausible that this participant experiences elevated perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported psychological distress, particularly high scores on the CES-D and STAI scales (Z-scores 3.4 and 3.13 respectively), are substantial indicators of potential elevated perceived stress. The population PSS has a mean of 21.61 and a median of 22.0, with the 75th percentile at 24.0. Given the strong positive correlations between CES-D and STAI scores with PSS, and the highly elevated Z-scores for both these measures, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls within the top 50% of the study population. Furthermore, the low self-esteem (Z-score -2.42) and low health satisfaction (Z-score -2.28) also contribute to a profile suggestive of higher stress. While some behaviors such as excessive screen time have positive correlations with PSS, the significant psychological markers are the strongest predictors in this dataset for an elevated PSS score.

The participant exhibits generally lower than average scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D, Z = -0.55) and chronic anxiety (STAI, Z = -0.43). Self-esteem is also near the population average (SelfEsteem, Z = -0.17). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score = 6.0, Z = -0.33), which is a common threshold for clinically significant disturbance. Trust in others is notably low (Trust, Z = -1.42), and self-reported happiness is also below average (Happy, Z = -0.53). Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Health Satisfaction, Z = 0.55).

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, this participant reports infrequent alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor (Usage: Three times a week or more, Z = 1.68), which is higher than the population average. Other substance usage, including recreational drugs and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as not at all. Physical activity levels are low, with infrequent exercise alone (Frequency: Less than 1-2 times a month, Z = -1.18), no exercise with others (Frequency: Not at all, Z = -1.58), and infrequent participation in sports (Frequency: Not at all, Z = -1.09). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement with screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Time: 16-30 minutes, Z = 0.01) and internet usage (Time: 1-3 hours, Z = 0.18), with lower engagement in listening to music (Time: 15 minutes or less, Z = -0.72) and socializing with friends (Time: 1-2 hours, Z = 0.16). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable-derived data reveal a relatively stable circadian rhythm, indicated by a moderate Interdaily Stability (Value = 0.37, Z = -0.33) and a lower than average Intradaily Variability (Value = 0.41, Z = -0.95), suggesting a regular daily pattern. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is below the population average (Mesor, Z = -0.57), and the Resting Heart Rate is also lower than average (Value = 52.9, Z = -0.62). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Amplitude, Z = 0.56), suggesting a more pronounced fluctuation in heart rate over the day. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (5:23 PM). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates periods of elevated heart rate in the evening, particularly between 6-7 PM (Value = 20.36, Z = 1.36) and 9-10 PM (Value = 17.24, Z = 1.61), and to a lesser extent between 2-3 PM (Value = 13.48, Z = 1.19). Conversely, significant reductions in heart rate are observed during early morning hours, with the largest negative deviations occurring between 3-4 AM (Value = -20.77, Z = -0.7) and 2-3 AM (Value = -17.12, Z = -0.63).

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Duration = 8 hours 18 minutes, Z = 1.39), but a standard deviation in sleep duration that is close to the population average. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:46:30), with a standard deviation in sleep start time that is below average, suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule. The participant reports no daily naps. The correlation analyses, while secondary to the holistic interpretation, suggest a tendency for lower self-esteem, happiness, trust, and physical health satisfaction to be associated with higher perceived stress, alongside a tendency for higher wine/liquor consumption and engagement in certain recreational activities to also be related to increased perceived stress. Conversely, longer sleep duration and higher levels of physical activity are generally associated with lower perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported measures of depression and anxiety are below average, and their self-esteem is near the population average. However, subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed, and self-reported happiness and trust are below average. Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate screen time and socializing, but has low levels of physical activity and limited engagement in reading or hobbies. Physiologically, they exhibit a relatively stable circadian rhythm with a lower resting heart rate, but show evening peaks in heart rate that correlate with increased perceived stress. The longer than average sleep duration is a positive indicator, but the disturbed subjective sleep quality is a concern. Considering the combination of disturbed subjective sleep, low trust, below-average happiness, low physical activity, and specific evening cardiovascular patterns associated with elevated stress, alongside the PSS population means and percentiles, the evidence suggests the participant may experience a level of perceived stress that places them in the upper half of the distribution. The population mean for PSS is 21.62, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. While specific PSS scores are not provided for this participant, the presence of multiple factors associated with elevated stress, such as disturbed sleep quality, low trust, and specific physiological arousal patterns in the evening, warrants consideration for a higher stress classification.

33133,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral indicators that inform an understanding of their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data reveals elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 1.84) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: 0.76), both of which are classified as ""Depressed"" and ""anxious,"" respectively. These findings are accompanied by a significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a high PSQI score (Z-score: 1.98), classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" While self-esteem (Z-score: -0.17) and perceived trust (Z-score: -0.78) are within the average range, and reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53), the concurrent presence of significant depressive and anxiety symptoms alongside poor sleep quality suggests a vulnerable psychological state.

Behavioral patterns indicate a moderate level of engagement in health-related activities. The participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is associated with a slightly above-average Z-score for beer consumption (1.01). Exercise habits include exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07) and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91), suggesting a commitment to physical activity. However, the lack of exercise with others (Z-score: -1.58) might indicate a preference for solitary activities. Daily recreational habits are varied, with a notable pattern of high internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score: 1.52) and moderate social interaction with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.16). Conversely, the participant reports minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or reading, and listening to music for 31 minutes to an hour. The high internet usage, in conjunction with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and poor sleep, may indicate a coping mechanism or a contributing factor to perceived stress.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals patterns that may reflect underlying stress responses and circadian rhythm disruptions. The participant's resting heart rate is within the typical range (Z-score: 0.05). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours, with pronounced negative deviations observed between 1 AM and 6 AM (e.g., -21.56 at 4-5 AM). This suggests a dampened physiological response during typical sleep periods. In contrast, the hours of 8-9 AM exhibit a strong positive deviation (2.09), potentially reflecting an increase in arousal upon waking or during the initial part of the day. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate regularity, with an interdaily stability of 0.4 (Z-score: -0.08) and intraday variability of 0.63 (Z-score: 0.6). The mesor (73.53, Z-score: -0.06) and amplitude (10.11, Z-score: -0.22) are within average ranges, suggesting that the overall daily rhythm is not drastically altered, but the marked deviations during sleep hours combined with high intraday variability could be indicative of sleep fragmentation or irregular sleep patterns, consistent with the self-reported disturbed sleep quality.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score: -0.68), which is slightly below the population average, and a relatively consistent sleep start time with a standard deviation of 101 minutes (Z-score: 0.39). The low sleep duration, coupled with the physiological patterns of dampened heart rate during sleep and self-reported poor sleep quality, strongly suggests that sleep is a significant area of concern for this participant and likely contributes to their overall perceived stress. The positive correlation between several indicators of psychological distress (CES-D, STAI) and PSS score, alongside the inverse correlation with self-esteem and happiness, further supports the notion that internal psychological states are strongly linked to perceived stress.

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Analysis of the provided data suggests that this participant likely experiences a **high** level of perceived stress, placing them in the **top 50%** of the study population. Several factors converge to support this conclusion. The participant exhibits elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 1.84) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: 0.76), both of which are significantly correlated with higher Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is markedly disturbed, as indicated by a high PSQI score (Z-score: 1.98), and sleep duration is below average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.68). Poor sleep is a well-established correlate of heightened stress perception.

While some behavioral aspects like exercise frequency are within an average to above-average range, the high internet usage (Z-score: 1.52) and lack of exercise with others (Z-score: -1.58) might hint at potential coping mechanisms or social isolation that could exacerbate stress. The physiological data, particularly the pronounced negative deviations in heart rate during nighttime hours and elevated positive deviation in the morning, along with a high intraday variability (Z-score: 0.6), are consistent with irregular and potentially stressed physiological functioning, which aligns with disturbed sleep. The PSS population data indicates a median PSS score of 22.0, with the 75th percentile at 24.0. Given the participant's elevated scores in depression, anxiety, and disturbed sleep, alongside a tendency towards irregular physiological patterns, it is highly probable that their overall PSS score would exceed the population median and fall within the upper half of the distribution.

47810,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant presents a complex interplay of self-reported psychological states, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics, particularly in relation to perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Notably, the participant reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.18) and a low level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.43), alongside high self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score: 0.11). Their reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53), and they express lower than average satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.7).

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, this individual engages in moderate alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94), while abstaining from beer, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits appear consistent, with activities like exercising alone, with others, and sports occurring 1-2 times a week, generally aligning with or slightly above population norms (Exercised Alone Z-score: 0.32, Exercised with Others Z-score: 0.53, Sports Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational habits lean towards less active pursuits; they do not engage in watching TV/videos/movies or video games, and report minimal internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.49). They do, however, report listening to music for 16-30 minutes daily (Z-score: -0.26) and spending time socializing with friends for 31 minutes an hour (Z-score: -0.62). Notably, reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as non-existent activities.

Wearable data reveals significant deviations in physiological regulation and sleep patterns. The participant exhibits a high intraday variability in heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 2.01), suggesting considerable fluctuations in physiological arousal throughout the day. Conversely, interdaily stability is slightly below average (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.08), indicating less consistent daily patterns. The mesor (mean heart rate level) is slightly elevated (Mesor Z-score: 0.17), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably higher than average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.52), indicating a more pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:46 PM. Within the hourly deviation from the mesor data, a distinct pattern emerges: significant negative deviations (indicating lower than expected heart rate) are observed during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 3 AM and 6 AM (e.g., 5-6 AM Z-score: -1.12, 4-5 AM Z-score: -0.97). Conversely, positive deviations, suggesting higher than expected heart rate, are concentrated in the evening and late night, from 6 PM to 11 PM (e.g., 6-7 PM Z-score: 1.09, 9-10 PM Z-score: 0.86). This pattern indicates a delayed or disrupted circadian rhythm, with physiological activity peaking later and recovery occurring earlier than typical.

Sleep statistics further support this disruption. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 40 minutes (Z-score: -0.65), which is below average. The median sleep start time is 1:26 AM (Z-score: Not provided for time itself, but deviation from mesor suggests late sleep). The sleep start time standard deviation is relatively low (Z-score: -0.4), suggesting some consistency in their late sleep schedule, though the overall duration is insufficient. There is a significant presence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 2.34), suggesting a compensatory behavior for insufficient nighttime sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score: 1.05) classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep, which aligns with the objective sleep duration and heart rate variability data.

The correlations provided indicate that higher PSS scores are weakly associated with increased depressive symptoms (0.28) and chronic anxiety (0.31). Higher PSS scores are also weakly associated with increased intraday variability in heart rate (0.16) and slightly more disturbed sleep start times (0.17). Conversely, higher PSS scores are weakly associated with lower self-reported happiness (-0.19) and less engagement in reading (-0.21).

Considering the provided data and its correlation with PSS, the participant's profile suggests a potential for elevated perceived stress. While their trait anxiety and self-esteem appear relatively stable, the disturbed sleep patterns, high intraday heart rate variability, late-night physiological arousal, and consistent napping behavior all point towards a system under strain. The PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep and the moderate depressive symptom scores, coupled with a self-reported low happiness and less engagement in restorative activities like reading, further contribute to this picture. The pattern of physiological arousal and recovery appearing misaligned with typical circadian rhythms could be a marker of stress-induced dysregulation. The overall evidence suggests that this participant's multifaceted indicators point towards a higher level of perceived stress.

58196,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, as indicated by STAI and CES-D scores that fall below the population mean (Z-scores of -1.02 and -0.76, respectively). This suggests a generally stable emotional disposition. Similarly, self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score of 1.64), and while self-esteem is above average (Z-score of 1.1), its correlation with perceived stress is weakly negative. Health satisfaction is also high (Z-score of 1.38). These self-reported indicators collectively point towards a generally positive psychological outlook and well-being.

In terms of lifestyle habits, the participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are notable; the participant exercises alone and with others at a frequency of three times a week or more, exceeding the population average. Notably, engagement in sports is infrequent. Sedentary leisure activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are not practiced, with internet usage and listening to music being relatively low. Socializing with friends and reading are also reported with limited time allocation.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as reflected by heart rate variability, shows moderate stability and regularity. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -0.57) suggests some variability in daily patterns, while Intradaily Variability (Z-score of 0.81) indicates a typical level of internal diurnal fluctuation in heart rate. The mesor (average heart rate) is below the population mean (Z-score of -1.01), alongside a lower than average amplitude (Z-score of -0.63), potentially reflecting a lower overall metabolic rate or a less pronounced daily variation in cardiovascular activity. The acrophase occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM), aligning with a typical circadian peak. The resting heart rate is also slightly below average (Z-score of -0.56). Analysis of hourly deviations from the mesor reveals periods of lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, followed by an increase during typical waking hours, with peak deviations observed in the late afternoon and early evening.

Sleep patterns indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 33 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.79). However, the variability in sleep duration and start time is relatively contained. The participant also reports occasional napping (Z-score of 0.94), which is more frequent than the population average. Subjectively, sleep quality is assessed as good (PSQI Z-score of -1.26), suggesting that despite a slightly shorter sleep duration, the participant experiences restful sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported measures of low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.02) and low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.76), coupled with high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.38), collectively suggest a disposition towards lower levels of perceived stress. While self-esteem is above average (Z-score 1.1), its weak negative correlation with PSS does not strongly indicate elevated stress. The consistently good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26) further supports a baseline of well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular physical activity and limited substance use, which are typically associated with lower stress levels. The moderate sleep duration, while slightly below average, does not appear to be a significant stressor given the good subjective sleep quality. The physiological data, including a lower than average mesor and amplitude, alongside a typical acrophase, do not present overt signs of chronic physiological dysregulation that would strongly predict high stress. The hourly heart rate data shows expected diurnal patterns without extreme deviations, and the circadian rhythm metrics suggest a reasonably structured, albeit not perfectly rigid, daily physiological rhythm.

Considering the overall pattern of these variables, the evidence leans towards the participant experiencing relatively lower levels of perceived stress. The absence of indicators commonly associated with elevated stress, such as high anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, or significant physiological dysregulation, suggests that their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a generally healthy psychological profile, with low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.97) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -0.82), and a relatively high self-esteem score (RSES Z-score: 0.96, though it's important to note the scale for RSES is typically reversed, meaning this score might indicate lower self-esteem relative to the population if higher values generally mean lower self-esteem; however, the provided interpretation states ""higher scores indicating greater self-esteem"", so we will proceed with that interpretation). Subjective health satisfaction is moderate (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.63). Notably, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -1.72).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, reporting consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all, which is below the population average (Recreational Drugs Z-score: -0.31, Non-prescribed Drugs Z-score: -0.11). Physical activity levels are relatively high, with exercise frequency of three times a week or more for exercising alone (Z-score: 1.07), and moderate frequency for exercising with others and participating in sports (Z-scores: 0.53 and 0.91, respectively). Daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities; the participant does not engage in watching TV/videos/movies or listening to music, and has low engagement in video games and sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is reported as 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.18), and social interaction with friends is also at 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.16). Reading frequency is reported as ""Do not do,"" which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.67).

Physiologically, circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable daily pattern, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.25 and an Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score of 0.06. However, the Intradaily Variability is notably low (Z-score: -1.59), suggesting a consistent, perhaps less dynamic, physiological rhythm throughout the day. The participant's resting heart rate is within the population average (Z-score: -0.14). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate deviation from the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.68 to -0.73), suggesting a period of significant physiological rest. Heart rate begins to increase and exceed the mesor from approximately 7 AM onwards, peaking in the early afternoon between 2-3 PM (Z-score: 1.37). This pattern suggests a typical diurnal variation in heart rate, with higher activity during waking and midday hours and lower activity during sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.59). The standard deviation of sleep duration is below average (Z-score: -0.82), suggesting consistent sleep duration from night to night. The median sleep start time is late at night (23:56:28), and the variability in sleep start times is also within the population average (Z-score: -0.11). The participant reports minimal napping (Z-score: -0.86).

Correlations between these metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) are generally weak, with most values falling within a small range. Notable correlations include a positive correlation between the deviation of heart rate from the mesor between 3-6 AM and PSS (Z-scores ranging from 0.19 to 0.21), suggesting that higher perceived stress might be associated with more pronounced deviations from the mesor during these early morning hours. A negative correlation is observed between reading frequency and PSS (Score Correlation: -0.21), indicating that less reading is associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, higher values of Intradaily Variability (Z-score: 0.16) and STAI (Z-score: 0.31) show a positive association with PSS, suggesting that more variability in daily physiological patterns and higher trait anxiety are linked to increased perceived stress.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the available data to determine the participant's overall perceived stress level in relation to the study population distribution. The participant's self-reported mental health indicators, including CES-D and STAI, fall into the ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" classifications, respectively, with Z-scores well below zero. This suggests a relatively low burden of depressive and anxious symptoms, which typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -1.72), which is a significant indicator of well-being and often associated with lower stress levels.

While the participant engages in some substance use (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS, their overall lifestyle includes significant physical activity, which may serve as a buffer against stress. The physiological data indicates a consistent circadian rhythm, with a low Intradaily Variability, which is positively correlated with PSS, suggesting that more stable physiological patterns might be associated with higher stress. The correlation between lower reading frequency and higher PSS also indicates a potential area where lifestyle modifications could impact perceived stress.

Considering the overall pattern, the participant's low scores in direct measures of distress (depression and anxiety), coupled with good subjective sleep quality, lean towards a lower overall perceived stress level. While certain behavioral and physiological metrics show correlations that could suggest a higher stress level, these associations are not consistently strong or across multiple domains. The positive correlations of lower Intradaily Variability and lower reading frequency with PSS are notable, but do not override the strong indicators of low distress. Therefore, it is most likely that the participant's PSS score falls within the bottom 50% of the study population distribution, representing relatively low to average perceived stress.

55424,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that are relevant to perceived stress. Self-reported data indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.26) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.55), both of which are significantly above the population mean. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively lower than average (Z-score = -0.87), and self-reported happiness is also considerably below the norm (Z-score = -1.61). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is severely disturbed, with a high Z-score of 3.37, suggesting significant challenges with sleep regulation. Despite these indicators, the participant reports moderate levels of trust (Z-score = 0.18) and satisfaction with their health (Z-score = 0.38).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance usage (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a month) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are mixed, with moderate solitary exercise (1-2 times a week) but frequent exercise with others (three times a week or more), while participation in sports is infrequent. Daily recreational activities show a pattern of moderate screen time (watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, ~30 minutes per hour) and listening to music, with limited engagement in solitary pursuits such as reading or video games, and comparatively less time spent socializing with friends. Sedentary hobbies are pursued for approximately 30 minutes per hour.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.22) being close to the population mean. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.13), and the amplitude is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.34), suggesting a moderate variability around the daily average. Resting heart rate is also close to the population mean (Z-score = -0.07). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a distinct diurnal pattern. Notably, there are significant elevations in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 3-4 PM, 4-5 PM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM), with the peak occurring between 7-8 PM (Z-score = 1.44). Conversely, there are notable dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM), with the lowest deviation observed between 12-1 AM (Z-score = -1.57). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of just over 7 hours (Z-score = 0.27), with a standard deviation of sleep duration being below average (Z-score = -0.72), suggesting relatively consistent sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is very late (around 00:22) with a standard deviation of under an hour, indicating some consistency in late sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is notably high (Z-score = 1.9), suggesting potential daytime sleepiness or attempts to compensate for poor nighttime sleep.

The participant's self-reported elevated scores on the CES-D and STAI scales, coupled with low self-reported happiness and poor sleep quality (PSQI), strongly suggest a state of elevated perceived stress. While some behavioral patterns like frequent exercise with others and moderate social interaction might be considered stress-mitigating, the overall pattern of high anxiety, depressive symptoms, and disturbed sleep points towards significant psychological distress. The physiological data, particularly the heightened heart rate activity in the late afternoon/early evening and significant sleep onset issues, further corroborate a state of heightened arousal and potential stress responses that may be impacting sleep.

Given the substantial Z-scores for depressive symptoms (2.26), trait anxiety (1.55), and disturbed sleep (3.37), the participant's self-reported psychological state and sleep quality are significantly elevated above the population average. These factors are highly indicative of elevated perceived stress. The population PSS has a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. While a direct PSS score is not provided, the strong correlation between high anxiety, depression, and poor sleep with perceived stress suggests that this participant likely falls within the upper half of the perceived stress distribution. The low self-reported happiness (Z-score = -1.61) also contributes to this inference.

23576,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological metrics, offering insights into their perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.66) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.72), alongside relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = 0.96). Health satisfaction is moderately elevated (Z-score = 0.72), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score = -0.53). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by PSQI, suggests disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score = -0.33), though this is not severely pronounced. Notably, substance usage across all categories is reported as ""Not at all,"" which is significantly below the population average (Z-scores ranging from -0.31 to -1.3).

Behavioral patterns reveal a strong engagement in physical activity, with exercising alone occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score = 1.07) and exercising with others and participating in sports occurring ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-scores of 0.53 and 0.91, respectively). Daily recreational habits include significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score = 1.71), indicating potential for sedentary leisure activities. Internet usage is around the population average (Z-score = -0.49), while time spent listening to music is lower than average (Z-score = -0.72). Socializing with friends occurs at a slightly above-average frequency (Z-score = 0.16). Reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-scores of -0.67 and -0.96, respectively).

Wearable data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.5) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 1.06) suggesting a degree of regularity. The MESOR (mean heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.35), and the amplitude of the diurnal heart rate variation is also slightly below average (Z-score = -0.1), with the acrophase (peak time) occurring in the mid-afternoon (4:05 PM). Resting heart rate is within the normal range for the population (Z-score = -0.07). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, Z-scores down to -0.57 to -0.15) and higher-than-average deviations during mid-morning and afternoon (e.g., 10 AM - 5 PM, Z-scores up to 0.56). Notably, there are also periods of elevated heart rate deviation in the evening (e.g., 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, Z-scores of -0.08 and 0.23 respectively).

Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes, which is longer than average (Z-score = 0.72), and a lower-than-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score = -0.98) and sleep start time (Z-score = -0.83). This suggests a consistent sleep schedule despite the subjective report of disturbed sleep. The absence of daily naps is also notable (Z-score = -0.86). Correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) indicate a generally weak relationship across most metrics. Of particular note, negative correlations are observed with self-reported happiness (r = -0.19), reading frequency (r = -0.21), and autocorrelation at 24 hours (r = -0.17), while positive correlations are seen with metrics related to higher arousal or activity during certain times of day and less consistent sleep patterns.

Given the available data, the participant's perceived stress score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population distribution. The consistently low self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and robust engagement in physical activity are strong indicators of lower perceived stress. While there are some behavioral patterns that might be associated with elevated stress, such as significant screen time in leisure and a slightly elevated heart rate deviation in the evening, these are generally weak or inconsistent in their correlation with PSS. The structured and stable sleep patterns, despite subjective reports of disturbance, also do not strongly suggest high stress. The participant's overall profile points towards a relatively well-adjusted individual with manageable stress levels.

Self-report measures indicate a generally low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and a classification of ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (Z-score: -0.62), suggesting a relative absence of significant trait anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem appears to be moderately high, as indicated by a Z-score of 0.82 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Subjective health satisfaction is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.8, suggesting a positive perception of physical well-being. Trust levels are close to the population mean (Z-score: 0.18), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53).

Behavioral patterns reveal a moderate engagement in certain lifestyle choices. The participant reports consuming alcohol (beer and wine/liquor) 1-2 times per week, with corresponding Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94, respectively, indicating higher than average consumption for these substances within the study population. Conversely, recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all,"" with respective Z-scores of -0.31 and -0.11. Physical activity levels show a pattern of exercising alone frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score: 1.07), while exercising with others and participating in sports are infrequent (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score: -0.88; ""Not at all,"" Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits are characterized by limited screen time for passive entertainment like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -1.25) and video games (Z-score: -0.56), moderate internet usage (Z-score: 0.18), and a higher engagement in listening to music (Z-score: 0.21) and socializing with friends (Z-score: 0.16) for 1-2 hours. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in minimally.

Wearable-derived physiological data highlight several notable characteristics. The participant's circadian rhythm, as reflected by heart rate variability, exhibits strong interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.0) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.46), suggesting a regular daily pattern in physiological activity. The MESOR, a measure of the central tendency of the circadian rhythm, is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.16). However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Z-score: 1.9), indicating a substantial variation between peak and trough heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, occurs around 4:00 PM. The resting heart rate is considerably lower than the population average (Z-score: -1.29). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of physiological arousal in the late morning and afternoon, with significant positive deviations observed between 11 AM and 3 PM (e.g., 1-2 PM Z-score: 2.22, 2-3 PM Z-score: 0.91). Conversely, the early morning hours, particularly between 3 AM and 6 AM, show substantial negative deviations from the mesor (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-score: -2.33, 5-6 AM Z-score: -2.02), suggesting a period of relative physiological quiescence. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours (Z-score: -0.2), which is close to average, with a slight tendency towards shorter sleep duration. The standard deviation of sleep duration is somewhat lower than average (Z-score: -0.69), suggesting more consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is around midnight, with a standard deviation that is close to the population average, indicating relative consistency in sleep timing. The participant does not engage in napping.

Overall, the participant presents with low levels of self-reported anxiety and depression, coupled with high self-esteem and health satisfaction. Behaviorally, they engage in moderate alcohol consumption and exhibit a pattern of frequent solo exercise alongside less frequent group activities. Daily routines include moderate internet and social media use, with less time spent on passive entertainment. Physiologically, there is a robust circadian rhythm with a high amplitude and a lower-than-average resting heart rate. The aggregated hourly heart rate data show a clear diurnal pattern of increased activity in the afternoon and reduced activity during the early morning hours. These factors, particularly the lower-than-average resting heart rate and the higher amplitude of heart rate variability, do not strongly indicate elevated perceived stress. The absence of significant anxiety and depressive symptoms further supports a profile of relatively lower perceived stress. Considering the population's PSS distribution (mean 21.62, 50th percentile 22.0), the available data suggests this participant likely falls within the bottom half of the distribution.

The participant presents with a profile characterized by generally low levels of psychological distress and stable behavioral patterns, with some notable exceptions. Self-reported measures indicate low depressive symptomology (CES-D score of 1.0, Z-score of -1.28) and low chronic anxiety proneness (STAI score of 28.0, Z-score of -1.31), suggesting a resilient psychological baseline. Similarly, self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 47.0, Z-Score of 1.24), and self-reported happiness is also elevated (Current Happiness score of 5.0, Z-Score of 1.64). Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Score of 4.78, Z-score of 0.38). Trust in others is also reported at a higher than average level (Score of 4.0, Z-Score of 1.47).

In terms of lifestyle habits, the participant reports low substance usage, with beer consumption being less than 1-2 times a month (Z-Score of -0.41) and recreational drugs and non-prescribed drugs being used ""Not at all"". Wine or liquor consumption is at a moderate level of 1-2 times a week (Z-Score of 0.94). Physical activity levels are relatively robust, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-Score of 1.07), and exercising with others and participation in sports occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits lean towards less screen-intensive activities, with a relatively low reported time spent watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-Score of 0.01) and very low internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-Score of -1.16). Notably, the participant reports ""Do not do"" for video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, which is unusual and may reflect either a lack of engagement in these specific activities or a misinterpretation of the categories.

Physiologically, circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable pattern, although with some variations. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is low (Value of 0.2, Z-Score of -1.73), indicating less regularity in daily heart rate patterns across consecutive days, while Intradaily Variability is also relatively low (Value of 0.34, Z-Score of -1.45), suggesting less fluctuation within a given day. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate around which the rhythm oscillates, is slightly elevated (Value of 78.2, Z-Score of 0.58). The Amplitude, indicating the range of heart rate variation within a day, is below average (Value of 7.67, Z-Score of -1.01). The Acrophase (peak heart rate) occurs in the late afternoon (5:03 PM). Resting Heart Rate is slightly elevated (Value of 60.6, Z-Score of 0.29).

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of higher than average heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late morning and early evening hours. Specifically, deviations are positive between approximately 9 AM and 11 AM, and again from 6 PM to 9 PM, with the most pronounced positive deviations observed between 7 PM and 8 PM (11.25) and 9 PM and 10 PM (11.17). Conversely, the participant experiences periods of lower than average heart rate deviation, particularly during the early morning hours (e.g., 3 AM to 6 AM, with deviations ranging from -13.03 to -12.10). This pattern suggests periods of increased physiological arousal during waking work or social hours and reduced arousal during sleep or early morning preparation for wakefulness.

Sleep statistics indicate a generally good sleep profile. The median sleep duration is notably long (8 hours 25 minutes, Z-Score of 1.53), suggesting ample time spent asleep. The sleep start time is relatively consistent around midnight (23:56:28). The standard deviation of sleep duration and sleep start time are within average ranges, indicating moderate consistency in sleep timing. The PSQI score of 5.0, while at the threshold for potential clinical significance, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" and has a Z-Score of -0.8, suggesting subjective sleep quality is not a significant concern.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data suggests a profile generally characterized by low perceived stress. Several factors contribute to this assessment: low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and chronic anxiety (STAI), alongside high self-esteem and happiness, all correlate with lower perceived stress. Behavioral patterns, such as moderate physical activity and a lack of high-risk substance use, further support a profile of lower stress. While some physiological data, like the Mesor and certain hourly heart rate deviations, indicate periods of increased arousal, these are not consistently associated with negative psychological outcomes in this individual. The long sleep duration and subjective classification of good sleep quality also point towards effective stress management and recovery.

The population PSS mean is 21.63, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. The participant's individual metrics, particularly the low scores in anxiety and depression, high self-esteem and happiness, and generally healthy lifestyle habits, suggest that their overall perceived stress is likely to be below the population median. While specific PSS scores are not provided, the constellation of supportive data leans towards a score in the bottom half of the distribution.

42137,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that may influence perceived stress. Notably, their self-reported anxiety proneness, as measured by the STAI, is in the average range for the study population (Z-score of 0.07), with a positive correlation to PSS score (0.31). This suggests that higher chronic anxiety is associated with higher perceived stress. While their depressive symptoms (CES-D) are not elevated and fall within the ""Not depressed"" classification (Z-score 0.18), there is a moderate positive correlation with PSS score (0.28), indicating that even sub-clinical increases in depressive symptoms may contribute to perceived stress. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17) but shows a weak negative correlation with PSS score (-0.15), suggesting that lower self-esteem might be minimally associated with higher perceived stress. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.3), but the correlation with PSS is near zero (-0.08), indicating it does not strongly influence perceived stress. Trust levels are notably high for this participant (Z-score 0.83) and show a negligible correlation with PSS (-0.04). Happiness is reported at a below-average level (Z-score -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation to PSS (-0.19), suggesting that lower self-reported happiness is associated with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral habits present a mixed picture. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, is generally low or non-existent, with only wine or liquor usage occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.19). Exercise frequency is relatively high, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07). However, engagement in sports and exercising with others is less frequent (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits indicate a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41). Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18), while listening to music and socializing with friends are reported at lower frequencies (15 minutes or less, and 31 minutes an hour respectively, with negative Z-scores). Reading also shows a below-average engagement (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32).

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals several key patterns. The participant exhibits lower-than-average mesor (Z-score -1.55) and amplitude (Z-score -0.72), suggesting a generally less dynamic cardiovascular system relative to the study population. Their resting heart rate is also below average (Z-score -0.93). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate regularity, with Interdaily Stability at 0.45 (Z-score 0.33) and Intradaily Variability at 0.63 (Z-score 0.6). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also present (0.35, Z-score 0.22). A distinct pattern emerges in the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor. While there are periods of lower heart rate during the late night and early morning, a notable peak in deviation occurs in the late afternoon, specifically between 4-5 PM (27.38, Z-score 2.76), and also in the late morning between 9-11 AM (around 20, Z-scores 2.07 and 2.14). These elevated heart rate deviations during waking hours, particularly in the late morning and afternoon, could reflect periods of increased physiological arousal or stress response. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above average (Z-score 0.14), but the standard deviation for sleep duration and start time are within average to slightly below average ranges. The PSQI score indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Z-Score 0.59), suggesting subjective sleep quality issues despite a relatively adequate duration.

Based on the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to be in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution. While the participant reports moderate anxiety proneness and slightly lower self-esteem and happiness, which correlate positively with PSS, these individual traits do not appear to be significantly elevated compared to the population. Crucially, their substance usage is minimal, and they engage in frequent solitary exercise. The notable exceptions that might lean towards higher stress are the subjective ""Disturbed Sleep"" indicated by the PSQI score and the elevated heart rate deviations during specific parts of the day, particularly in the late morning and afternoon, which could suggest physiological responses to stressors. However, when considering the overall picture, including average sleep duration, relatively low reported depression, high trust, and moderate levels of most other behavioral indicators, these factors collectively suggest a perceived stress level that is more likely to fall within the average or lower range of the study population. The positive correlations of certain traits with PSS are present but do not appear to be driving the score into the upper half of the distribution, especially in the absence of significantly high scores in those self-report measures or more pronounced negative behavioral or physiological patterns.

48013,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological rhythms that may inform their perceived stress levels. Self-report data reveal elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.59) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.35), alongside lower than average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -1.43) and happiness (Happy Z-score: -1.61). Notably, the participant reports low trust in others (Trust Z-score: -2.07) and a moderate level of health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.3), despite a healthy BMI. Their academic performance has shown an upward trend, with GPA increasing from 2.53 in Fall 2015 to 3.6 in Fall 2016.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent exercise, reporting exercising alone and with others three times a week or more, and participating in sports 1-2 times a week. They consume alcohol moderately (wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) and do not report using recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily activities include significant internet usage (2-3 hours) and listening to music (2-3 hours), with some time dedicated to watching TV/videos and socializing. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in reading or playing video games, potentially indicating a preference for passive or auditory-based leisure. Sleep quality, as assessed by PSQI, is categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score: 0.13), and median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours and 56 minutes (Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.31), with considerable variability in sleep start time.

Physiological data from the wearable indicate a relatively stable circadian rhythm, though with some deviations. The mesor, representing the midpoint of the circadian rhythm, is slightly elevated (Mesor Z-score: 0.48) compared to the population, suggesting a higher average heart rate. The amplitude of the rhythm is below average (Amplitude Z-score: -1.08), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported as 4:28 PM. Non-parametric measures suggest reduced interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.48) and somewhat reduced intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -0.53) in heart rate, implying a less structured daily pattern. The resting heart rate is within the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.14). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a distinct pattern: significantly elevated heart rates in the early morning (6-7 AM and 7-8 AM), followed by a dip in the late morning and early afternoon, with a notable increase in the late afternoon and early evening (6-7 PM). These physiological patterns, particularly the early morning arousal, may reflect the individual's response to waking and daily demands.

The participant's perceived stress level, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), needs to be evaluated in the context of the provided data. The PSS population data shows a median score of 22.0, with a 75th percentile of 24.0. To determine if the participant falls in the top or bottom 50% of the distribution, we look for evidence that either elevates or moderates their stress perception. Elevated levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.35) and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.59), coupled with low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -1.43) and happiness (Happy Z-score: -1.61), are strong indicators of potential distress that would likely contribute to a higher PSS score. Furthermore, disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 0.13) and a shorter than average sleep duration (Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.31) are commonly associated with increased stress. While the participant exhibits positive lifestyle choices such as regular exercise, the presence of significant psychological distress markers, lower subjective well-being, and poorer sleep hygiene suggest a predisposition towards elevated perceived stress. The negative correlations observed between PSS and metrics like reading (Score Correlation: -0.21) and self-esteem (Score Correlation: -0.15) further support the notion that lower levels of these protective factors are associated with higher PSS. Given the convergence of evidence from psychological distress, low subjective well-being, and sleep disturbances, it is reasonable to infer that the participant's overall perceived stress level likely places them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

14571,12.0,0.015544041450777202,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant careful consideration in the context of perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a notable absence of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.38) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -2.11), alongside a relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.1). This suggests a strong internal psychological resource. However, self-reported happiness is slightly elevated (Happy Z-score: 1.64), and trust in others is markedly low (Trust Z-score: -2.39). Health satisfaction is moderate (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.45), and their Body Mass Index (18.79) falls on the lower end of a healthy range.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in extensive sedentary activities. They report spending more than 4 hours daily on watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 3.17), video games (Z-score: 4.74), internet usage (Z-score: 2.19), listening to music (Z-score: 2.06), socializing with friends (Z-score: 2.53), and engaging in other sedentary hobbies (Z-score: 3.19). This pattern is particularly pronounced for video games, which significantly deviates from the population average. In contrast, their engagement in physical activity is minimal, with ""Not at all"" frequency reported for exercising alone and sports, and ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" for exercising with others. Substance usage is generally low, with no reported use of beer or recreational drugs, and infrequent wine/liquor consumption. Sleep patterns, as indicated by the PSQI (Z-score: -1.72) and Fitbit data, appear generally good, with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score: 0.06) and a relatively stable sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 54 minutes, Z-score: -0.64).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score: 2.4) and low intradaily variability (Z-score: -2.29), suggesting a structured daily physiological cycle. The mesor (circadian rhythm average) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 1.35), and the amplitude (variation around the mesor) is also notable (Z-score: 1.72), indicating significant daily fluctuations in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is observed in the late afternoon (4:51 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show higher-than-average activity in the late afternoon and evening, peaking between 7-8 PM (14.84 deviation), and lower-than-average activity during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-6 AM. Resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.51).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data presents a complex picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, they report very low levels of anxiety and depression, coupled with high self-esteem and good subjective sleep quality. Their physiological data indicates a highly regular circadian rhythm and relatively good sleep duration. These factors would typically be associated with lower perceived stress.

However, several indicators point towards potential stress amplification. The extensive engagement in sedentary leisure activities, particularly video games and general internet usage, suggests a potential reliance on passive coping mechanisms or avoidance behaviors, which can be linked to higher stress. Furthermore, their very low trust in others (Z-score: -2.39) could indicate social isolation or difficulty in seeking support, both of which are known stressors. The elevated mesor and amplitude in heart rate, while indicative of a regular rhythm, also suggest a higher overall physiological arousal level, which could be a physiological correlate of underlying stress. The strong positive correlations between several sedentary activities (internet usage, watching TV/videos/movies, video games) and perceived stress, although not necessarily causal, hint at a behavioral pattern that may be intertwined with stress.

Considering the population statistics for PSS, the mean is 21.64 with a 50th percentile of 22.0. While direct PSS scores are not provided for this participant, the presence of significant behavioral patterns associated with potential stress (high sedentary leisure, low trust) alongside physiological indicators of elevated arousal, even within a regular rhythm, suggests that their perceived stress level may lean towards the higher end of the distribution. The absence of strong negative self-report markers like anxiety and depression does not fully negate the potential impact of these other factors on overall perceived stress. The significant positive Z-scores for several sedentary habits and the low trust score are more indicative of factors that can contribute to elevated stress rather than buffer it.

Given the combination of extensive sedentary leisure, social withdrawal indicators (low trust), and elevated physiological arousal, it is plausible that this participant falls within the top 50% of the study population concerning perceived stress.

69057,26.0,0.927461139896373,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics that warrant careful consideration when evaluating perceived stress. Self-report data indicates a notable elevation in trait anxiety, as evidenced by a Z-score of 1.16 on the STAI-Trait scale, placing the participant in the ""anxious"" classification and above the 75th percentile of the study population for this measure. This elevated anxiety proneness is associated with a modest positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem is within the lower range of the population (Z-score of -0.45), with a slight negative correlation (-0.15) to perceived stress. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, are within the non-depressed range (Z-score of -0.14) and show a weak positive correlation (0.28) with perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score of 0.13), which aligns with the objective Fitbit data revealing a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 35 minutes, significantly below the study average (Z-score of -1.99).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate engagement in physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07) but less frequently exercising with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.53). Recreational substance use, including beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a month, which is close to the population average. Notably, the use of recreational drugs is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score of 1.61), and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreation habits reveal a substantial amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 0.01) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.67). Notably, the participant reports not engaging in video games or reading, with internet usage falling within the lower range of time spent (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of -0.49).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals several salient characteristics. The participant exhibits a significantly lower resting heart rate than the study population (Value: 43.6, Z-score: -1.73), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively low interdaily stability (Value: 0.32, Z-score: -0.74), suggesting less regularity in daily activity patterns. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is also considerably lower than the population mean (Value: 57.89, Z-score: -2.19). The hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor data reveals specific patterns. There is a notable elevation in heart rate deviation during late afternoon and evening hours, particularly between 5-6 PM (Value: 22.77, Z-score: 1.79) and 7-8 PM (Value: 16.1, Z-score: 0.80). These periods of elevated cardiovascular arousal might correspond to daily stressors or engaging activities. Conversely, during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM), heart rate deviations are substantially negative, reflecting periods of low physiological activity consistent with sleep.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), is estimated to be in the bottom 50% of the study population. This assessment is based on a holistic interpretation of the available data. While the participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI, Z-score 1.16) which correlates positively with PSS, this is mitigated by several factors. The participant's self-esteem is not critically low, and depressive symptoms are not elevated. Notably, the objective physiological data does not indicate widespread dysregulation suggestive of high chronic stress. The significantly lower resting heart rate and mesor, while potentially reflecting fitness, do not align with a state of heightened physiological stress. Furthermore, the average deviation from the mesor shows distinct periods of increased heart rate in the evening, which may reflect lifestyle activities rather than generalized physiological distress. The strong negative correlation of sleep duration with PSS (Z-score of -1.99) suggests that while sleep is disturbed, it might not be driving an exceptionally high PSS score in this individual, as the low sleep duration itself has a notable negative correlation. The generally lower Z-scores across several lifestyle and health satisfaction metrics, coupled with the absence of significant correlations with PSS, further supports this conclusion. The observed evening cardiovascular elevations could be attributed to lifestyle factors rather than a pervasive stress response impacting the overall PSS score.

64232,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a moderate level of chronic anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI Trait score of 44.0, placing them in the upper quartile of the study population (Z-score of 0.27). While self-esteem is reported as slightly below average (Z-score of -0.17), their reported happiness is notably lower than the population mean (Z-score of -0.53). Depressive symptoms are reported at a level considered not depressed (CES-D score of 13.0, Z-score of -0.03). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed, with a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score of 0.59), exceeding the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and indicating a poorer subjective sleep experience than the majority of participants.

Behavioral data reveal a pattern of moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, and recreational drugs consumed 1-2 times a month. Notably, the participant reports no use of non-prescribed drugs. In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in sports with a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score of 1.58), indicating a higher level of engagement in structured physical activity than most. However, exercising alone occurs less frequently (1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.32), and exercising with others is infrequent (1-2 times a month, Z-score of -0.17). Leisure activities are characterized by a low engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with no reported time spent on these. Reading is also not a regular habit. Internet usage is moderate (1-2 hours), and socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily. Listening to music is a more frequent activity, with 16-30 minutes dedicated daily.

Wearable data suggest a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability value of 0.22 (Z-score of -1.56), suggesting a lower degree of regularity in daily patterns compared to the population. However, the Intradaily Variability is relatively low (0.48, Z-score of -0.46), implying less fluctuation within daily cycles. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of 0.26 (Z-score of -0.53) further supports a somewhat less structured daily rhythm. The participant's Mesor, or average daily heart rate level, is above the population mean (77.33, Z-score of 0.46), while the Amplitude, representing the range of heart rate variation, is slightly below average (-0.17). The Acrophase, the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:57 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (59.4, Z-score of 0.15). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals periods of heightened physiological arousal during the late evening (9-10 PM, 10-11 PM) and early morning waking hours (4-7 AM), with significant negative deviations during the deep sleep phases of the night (2-4 AM).

Sleep statistics indicate a slightly longer than average median sleep duration of 8 hours (Z-score of 1.01) and a more variable sleep duration (Standard Deviation of 136 minutes, Z-score of 0.79). The median sleep start time is notably late (00:40:51), with a high standard deviation (150 minutes, Z-score of 1.48), suggesting significant variability in sleep timing. The participant reports no daily naps, which aligns with a lower Z-score for this metric.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported data suggest a profile potentially associated with elevated perceived stress. Their STAI-Trait score indicates a disposition towards anxiety, and their subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed. While depressive symptoms are not reported, lower self-reported happiness could be indicative of underlying stress. The notable variability in sleep start time, despite a longer average duration, may also contribute to perceived stress and a less regulated circadian rhythm. The elevated resting heart rate and some patterns in hourly heart rate deviations, particularly during early morning hours, could also reflect a physiological state of arousal.

Conversely, some indicators point towards a less stressful experience or potentially a more balanced coping strategy. The participant engages in regular sports, which can be a stress-reducing behavior. Their preference for less passive leisure activities like watching TV and video games, and their engagement in reading and socializing with friends, although not always frequent, suggest a tendency towards more engaging and potentially less passive coping mechanisms. The relatively low Intradaily Variability in heart rate suggests a degree of stability within daily cycles, which can be beneficial for stress management.

Considering the overall evidence, the presence of moderate trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep quality, and a less stable sleep schedule, alongside a slightly elevated resting heart rate and some patterns of physiological arousal, are more indicative of a perceived stress level that would place the participant in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution. While positive coping behaviors are present, the internal psychological and physiological markers of potential stress appear to outweigh these in this assessment.

37404,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological data, yielding insights into their perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological state. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score -0.66) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 35.0, Z-score -0.62), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" respectively, relative to the study population. Self-esteem is also within the average range, with a score of 38.0 (Z-score -0.03) falling near the population mean. Subjective health satisfaction is slightly above average (score 4.44, Z-score 0.13). Happiness levels are also reported as being slightly above average (Z-score -0.53), although the interpretation of this Z-score requires careful consideration of the scale's directionality. Trust in others is also reported as being within the lower range of scores (Z-score -0.46), suggesting a tendency towards lower trust.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits moderate engagement in some activities while demonstrating a preference for sedentary habits during daily recreation. They engage in drinking wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, a frequency higher than the average (Z-score 0.94), and beer 1-3 times a month (Z-score 0.3). Exercise habits are notable, with solo exercise occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), while exercising with others occurs less frequently (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53). Notably, participation in sports is absent (Z-score -1.09). Daily recreation largely leans towards less active pursuits, with minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.62) and playing video games (does not do, Z-score -0.56). Internet usage is reported as 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score -0.49), listening to music for 16-30 minutes (Z-score -0.26), and socializing with friends for 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score -0.62). Reading and sedentary hobbies are reported as not being done or taking 15 minutes or less, respectively (Z-scores -0.67 and -0.36). Sleep quality, as assessed by PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13), indicating a slight tendency towards poorer subjective sleep quality. Objective sleep metrics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 9 minutes (Z-score -0.04), which is close to the population average. However, the sleep duration variability is relatively low (Z-score -0.78), suggesting consistent sleep length. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:48:47), with moderate variability (Z-score -0.39). There are no reported daily naps.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a generally regular circadian rhythm, though with some notable deviations in diurnal heart rate patterns. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.12), with a value of 73.04 bpm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly lower than average (Z-score -1.54), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. This is further supported by low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.54), indicating a less predictable and consistent daily pattern of heart rate activity. Intradaily variability is elevated (Z-score 1.37), suggesting more frequent and possibly sharper fluctuations in heart rate within a 24-hour period. The acrophase, indicating the time of peak heart rate, is reported as 5:32 PM.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. During the late night and early morning hours (approximately 2 AM to 7 AM), the participant exhibits a greater negative deviation from their mesor, particularly between 4 AM and 6 AM, where deviations reach their lowest points (-13.81 and -15.84 respectively). This suggests a period of physiological rest or reduced arousal during these hours, which aligns with sleep. As the day progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, peaking in the late afternoon and evening, notably between 7 PM and 9 PM, with a peak positive deviation of 14.99 at 7-8 PM. This pattern generally reflects typical diurnal activity. However, there are notable deviations from expected patterns; for instance, the period between 1 PM and 4 PM shows significant negative deviations (e.g., -13.81 at 4-5 AM, -12.26 at 3-4 AM, -7.87 at 2-3 AM), which is unusual for the typical wakeful period and may indicate periods of physiological deceleration or potential stress response during waking hours. The positive correlations between several of these negative deviations during early morning hours and PSS score (e.g., 3-4 AM: 0.19, 4-5 AM: 0.20, 5-6 AM: 0.21) suggest that a more pronounced physiological slowdown during these early waking hours might be associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, positive correlations with PSS are observed for some elevated heart rate deviations during later morning hours (e.g., 7-8 AM: 0.11, 8-9 AM: 0.06).

Overall, the participant's data suggests a person with generally stable psychological traits, moderate social engagement, and a tendency towards sedentary leisure activities. Their objective physiological rhythms show some irregularity, particularly in intradaily variability and less pronounced daily amplitude, which may be influenced by their reported disturbed sleep and a tendency for marked physiological deceleration in the early morning hours. The correlations between these physiological patterns and the PSS score, specifically the association between pronounced early morning physiological slowdown and higher perceived stress, are noteworthy.

Based on a holistic analysis of the provided data, the participant's perceived stress level (PSS) is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population. While the participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, and their sleep duration is near average, the presence of ""Disturbed Sleep"" as indicated by the PSQI, along with certain physiological patterns like low interdaily stability and autocorrelation, suggest a degree of internal irregularity. The notable negative correlations between certain daily recreation habits (e.g., Reading, Video Games, Socializing with Friends) and the PSS score, and positive correlations between higher levels of alcohol consumption and PSS, hint at potential coping mechanisms or lifestyle factors that might mitigate higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant's generally positive self-reported psychological state regarding happiness and self-esteem, despite reporting slightly lower trust, leans towards an average or lower stress perception. The correlations of physiological data with PSS, while present, do not overwhelmingly point towards elevated stress across multiple indicators. The population data indicates a median PSS of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0, suggesting that scores below this range are considered average or low. Given the evidence, the participant's overall profile is more indicative of being within the lower half of the PSS distribution.

70492,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral indicators that warrant a multi-modal interpretation in relation to their perceived stress. Self-report data reveal a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16, Z=0.28) and a notably elevated trait anxiety score (STAI score of 49, Z=0.76), with positive correlations to perceived stress in both cases (0.28 and 0.31, respectively). This suggests a dispositional tendency towards experiencing negative affect. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within average to slightly below average range (RSES score of 34, Z=-0.59), with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.15), indicating that lower self-esteem is not strongly associated with higher perceived stress in this dataset. Health satisfaction is also on the lower side (Score=3.44, Z=-0.62), though its correlation with perceived stress is negligible.

Behavioral habits, as reported, indicate a moderate intake of alcohol (Beer 1-2 times a week, Z=1.01) and a low frequency of exercise (Exercised Alone less than 1-2 times a month, Z=-1.18; Exercised with Others 1-2 times a month, Z=-0.17). Substance usage, particularly non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" but with a very high Z-score of 6.84, suggesting this is an outlier behavior relative to the study population, though its correlation with perceived stress is low (0.03). Daily recreational habits are characterized by significant internet usage (2-3 hours, Z=0.85) and social interaction with friends (2-3 hours, Z=0.95), both with moderate positive correlations with perceived stress (0.10 and 0.06, respectively). Notably, reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z=-0.67) with a moderate negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.21), suggesting that engaging in reading might be associated with lower perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices paint a picture of a regular, albeit somewhat lower than average, circadian rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate around the circadian rhythm) is lower than the population average (69.52, Z=-0.6), as is the amplitude (9.42, Z=-0.44), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:12 PM). Interdaily stability (0.43, Z=0.17) and intradaily variability (0.54, Z=-0.04) suggest a moderately stable daily rhythm, with the autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.29, Z=-0.28) further supporting regularity. The resting heart rate is also on the lower side (53.6, Z=-0.54), correlating positively with perceived stress (0.14). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveal distinct patterns: a significant dip during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., -19.42 at 6-7 am, Z=-0.3), followed by a pronounced increase in heart rate during the midday and early afternoon (e.g., 14.49 at 12-1 pm, Z=0.91), with subsequent moderation in the evening. The most substantial positive deviations from the Mesor, indicating higher physiological arousal relative to baseline, occur in the midday to early afternoon, coinciding with potential academic or social demands. These periods of heightened cardiovascular activity show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress, particularly in the early morning (e.g., 4-5 am, Z=1.18, correlation=0.19; 5-6 am, Z=0.68, correlation=0.21).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is close to average (Z-score=-0.13), but this is accompanied by a significantly high standard deviation in sleep duration (222 minutes, Z=2.75) and a markedly earlier median sleep start time (03:03:40) with a substantial standard deviation (138 minutes, Z=1.21). This variability in sleep patterns, particularly the pronounced shifts in sleep timing and duration, may contribute to physiological dysregulation and perceived stress, as indicated by the positive correlations between sleep duration standard deviation (0.13) and sleep start time standard deviation (0.17) and perceived stress.

Overall, this participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety and moderate depressive symptoms, coupled with a highly variable sleep schedule and significant periods of increased physiological arousal during the day. While self-esteem and health satisfaction are lower, and social engagement and internet usage are high, the most salient indicators point towards a profile that likely contributes to elevated perceived stress. The heightened anxiety, sleep irregularities, and pronounced diurnal heart rate fluctuations, particularly during potentially demanding periods of the day, are strong indicators for higher perceived stress.

The participant's data suggests a PSS score that is likely within the top 50% of the study population. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI score of 49, Z=0.76) and moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16, Z=0.28), both positively correlated with perceived stress, are significant indicators. Furthermore, the substantial variability in sleep duration (Z=2.75) and sleep start time (Z=1.21) suggests potential sleep disruption which is often linked to higher stress levels. The physiological data show significant deviations in heart rate during the day, with positive correlations to perceived stress observed during early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 am, correlation=0.19; 5-6 am, correlation=0.21). While some factors like lower resting heart rate and slightly below average self-esteem might not directly contribute to high stress, the combination of psychological predispositions, sleep irregularity, and physiological reactivity during key parts of the day strongly suggests an elevated stress experience. Comparing these indicators to the population PSS distribution, where the 50th percentile is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, the observed pattern is more indicative of an experience that would place them above the median.

95543,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant demonstrates a psychological profile characterized by low levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, as indicated by Z-scores of -1.81 for the STAI and -1.28 for the CES-D, respectively. They report high self-esteem (Z-score of 1.52) and happiness (Z-score of 1.64), alongside a generally high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score of 1.3). Academically, the participant exhibits strong performance, with a GPA consistently above 3.8. Their self-reported sleep quality is good, as indicated by a PSQI score of 3.0, which is significantly below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance and associated with a Z-score of -1.72.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of physical activity, exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.23), though they do not exercise alone. Their daily recreational habits include moderate engagement with video games (Z-score of 1.71 for time spent) and TV/video/movie watching (Z-score of 1.28 for time spent), alongside less frequent engagement with reading and sedentary hobbies. Notably, substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all."" The participant exhibits a tendency towards higher autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.57), suggesting some degree of regularity in their daily rhythm, which is further supported by a relatively high mesor (Z-score of 1.22) indicating a generally elevated baseline heart rate compared to the population. Their circadian rhythm exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.08) but low intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.11), suggesting a relatively stable daily pattern of activity and rest. Sleep duration is slightly above the population median (Z-score of 0.29 for median duration), with a standardized deviation of sleep duration that is lower than average (Z-score of -0.92), suggesting more consistent sleep lengths. The average sleep start time is late, with a standard deviation that indicates some variability in sleep onset (Median Sleep Start Time: 02:25:30, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.08).

The analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Relative to the mesor, the participant experiences the greatest positive deviations during the evening and nighttime hours, specifically between 6 PM and 11 PM, with peak deviations observed between 8 PM and 9 PM (21.48) and 7 PM and 8 PM (20.17). Conversely, the most significant negative deviations from the mesor occur in the early morning hours, from approximately 3 AM to 7 AM, reaching their lowest point between 5 AM and 6 AM (-19.34) and 4 AM and 5 AM (-16.85). These patterns suggest a physiological profile where elevated heart rate activity is more pronounced in the later parts of the day and early evening, followed by a significant dip during the early morning. This pattern, particularly the pronounced evening elevation, warrants consideration in relation to the participant's reported late sleep start time.

Based on the available data, the participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a generally positive state with low reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and good academic performance. While they exhibit some positive correlations with metrics that could indicate higher stress (e.g., higher video game usage, higher autocorrelation at 24 hours, higher mesor), the strength of these correlations is generally weak. Furthermore, the consistently low scores on measures of anxiety and depression, coupled with good sleep quality, point towards a lower overall stress experience. The PSS population mean is 21.62 with a 50th percentile of 22.0. Without the participant's direct PSS score, an inference must be made. Given the robust indicators of well-being and low symptomology, it is more probable that their perceived stress score falls within the bottom half of the distribution.

67106,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several metrics suggesting a potentially elevated level of perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, z = -1.18) and general anxiety (STAI score of 29.0, z = -1.22), alongside high self-esteem (RSES score of 46.0, z = 1.1). However, subjective happiness is notably high (Current score of 5.0, z = 1.64), contrasting with moderate health satisfaction (Score of 6.22, z = 1.47), which is indicative of higher overall satisfaction with physical health. The PSQI score of 6.0 falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, suggesting subjective sleep quality issues, which aligns with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes (z = -0.51), falling slightly below the population median. Trust in others is at a near-average level (Score of 3.67, z = 0.83). Substance usage and engagement in sports and exercising with others are notably low, with frequencies at or below ""Not at all"" for most categories. Daily recreational habits are also skewed towards minimal engagement across most activities, with the exception of reading (15 minutes or less, z = 0.32), internet usage (15 minutes or less, z = -1.83), and a sedentary hobby of 16-30 minutes (z = 0.23), while socialising with friends is particularly minimal ('15 minutes or less', z = -2.2).

Wearable data reveals some indicators of physiological and behavioral regularity. The participant exhibits strong interdaily stability (Value of 0.64, z = 1.9) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value of 0.57, z = 2.07), suggesting a relatively consistent daily rhythm in heart rate. The mesor (Value of 72.42, z = -0.21) and resting heart rate (Value of 56.3, z = -0.22) are within typical ranges, being slightly below the population mean. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is moderately elevated (Value of 12.6, z = 0.59), suggesting a larger fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows distinct patterns of increased cardiovascular arousal during later evening hours, with significant positive deviations observed between 6 PM and 10 PM, peaking at 8-9 PM (deviation of 16.52, z = 1.21). Conversely, heart rates are notably lower during the early morning hours, reaching their lowest point between 3 AM and 6 AM. The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep start time of approximately 1:29 AM, which is relatively late, and a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration, suggesting some variability in sleep patterns. The presence of occasional naps (Mean Daily Naps = 0.12, z = 0.61) might indicate attempts to compensate for insufficient sleep. The generally low correlations with PSS scores for most of these metrics suggest that these individual factors may not be strong direct predictors of perceived stress in this participant, requiring a more holistic interpretation.

Considering the overall data, the participant presents a mixed picture. While they report low levels of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem, several factors may contribute to a higher perceived stress level. The PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" and a sleep duration that is slightly below average, coupled with a late sleep start time, suggest potential sleep-related stress. The minimal engagement in social activities and exercise, which are often considered stress-buffering behaviors, is also notable. Furthermore, the elevated amplitude of the circadian rhythm and pronounced evening heart rate arousal, while not directly correlated with PSS, can be physiological indicators associated with stress. The high subjective happiness score might be an outlier or indicate a coping mechanism that masks underlying stress. Given the evidence of disturbed sleep, minimal social engagement, and specific physiological patterns (circadian amplitude and evening arousal), the participant's perceived stress level is likely to fall within the higher range of the study population, suggesting they would be in the top 50th percentile.

83612,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits a multifaceted profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that warrant examination in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported data indicate elevated levels of chronic anxiety, as evidenced by a high STAI-Trait score (Z-score = 1.65), placing them in the ""anxious"" classification. This finding is particularly salient given the positive correlation (0.31) between STAI scores and perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively lower (Z-score = -1.29), which may interact with anxiety to influence overall stress perception. The participant reports a relatively neutral level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score, Z-score = 0.18) and average happiness (Z-score = 0.55), suggesting that anxiety and self-esteem are more prominent psychological markers than depression or subjective happiness in this context. Health satisfaction is also reported as average (Z-score = -0.03).

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a moderate engagement in exercise, participating in solo and group exercise 1-2 times per week, with a slight tendency towards exercising with others (Z-score = 0.53). They do not participate in sports (Z-score = -1.09). Recreational substance use is infrequent, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a month, and beer less than 1-2 times a month, while recreational and non-prescribed drugs are not used. Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement with watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 0.01) and internet usage (Z-score = 0.18), but they dedicate minimal time to listening to music (Z-score = -0.72) and socializing with friends (Z-score = -0.62). Notably, reading is not a reported activity (Z-score = -0.67). The participant exhibits a generally good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (Z-score = -0.8) and a classification of ""Good Sleep."" However, wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes (Z-score = -0.59), which is below the typical recommendation.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals patterns that may reflect stress or altered daily rhythms. The participant's resting heart rate is within a normal range (Value = 54.6, Z-score = -0.42). Circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively low interdaily stability (Value = 0.28, Z-score = -1.07) and moderate intradaily variability (Value = 0.7, Z-score = 1.09), suggesting some degree of irregularity in their daily physiological patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Value = 0.17, Z-score = -1.29), further indicating a less robust daily rhythmicity. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals notable deviations from the mesor. Specifically, there are significant positive deviations during typical waking hours, peaking between 4 PM and 6 PM (e.g., 4-5 PM: 15.79, 9-10 PM: 15.67), which could indicate periods of increased physiological arousal or stress. Conversely, negative deviations are observed during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: -14.9), aligning with expected sleep patterns but showing a substantial drop relative to the mesor. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is reported at 4:23 PM, which falls within the period of elevated heart rate deviations.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), needs to be evaluated in the context of the study population's distribution. The population PSS mean is 21.61 with a standard deviation of 3.68. The 50th percentile is 22.0, and the 75th percentile is 24.0. This participant's elevated anxiety levels (STAI Z-score = 1.65) and lower self-esteem (Z-score = -1.29) are strongly correlated with perceived stress (0.31 and -0.15 respectively). While their subjective sleep quality is good, the actual sleep duration is slightly below average. The physiological data indicates periods of elevated heart rate during the day and evening, and a less stable circadian rhythm, which are often associated with higher stress levels. Given the strong positive correlation of anxiety with PSS and the physiological indicators of potential stress or dysregulation, it is plausible that this participant experiences a PSS score that falls within the higher half of the distribution.

92566,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators that inform an understanding of their perceived stress levels. Self-reported measures reveal a low proneness to anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.71) and a non-depressed symptom profile (CES-D Z-score of -0.86). This suggests a baseline of psychological resilience. However, self-esteem is notably high (RSES Z-score of 1.38), which typically correlates with lower stress, yet happiness is also elevated (Happy Z-score of 1.64), hinting at a potentially positive affective state that might buffer perceived stress. Health satisfaction is above average (Z-score of 1.22). Behavioral habits indicate moderate social engagement with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95) and a significant amount of reading time (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 1.3), which could serve as positive coping mechanisms. Conversely, alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.94), which is higher than the average, while beer consumption is average. Notably, the participant reports not engaging with recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (49.05 bpm, Z-score of -1.08). The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.08) and intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.18), suggesting a relatively regular daily rhythm in heart rate patterns. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.35), and the amplitude (variation around the mesor) is near the population average (Z-score of 0.09). The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, is recorded at 4:17 PM. Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. During the late night and early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate is consistently below the mesor, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 2 AM and 5 AM (Z-scores ranging from -1.51 to -1.77), indicating a period of significant physiological rest. Upon waking, heart rate deviations become positive and increase throughout the morning, peaking between 7 AM and 9 AM (Z-scores of 1.14 and 1.13 respectively), reflecting typical diurnal arousal. A dip is observed in the early afternoon (2-3 PM, Z-score of -1.2), followed by a substantial increase in positive deviation in the late afternoon and early evening, particularly between 6 PM and 8 PM (Z-scores of 1.35 and 0.8), suggesting periods of heightened physiological activity during these times.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 17 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -1.11). The standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly above average, suggesting some variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:48:38), with a standard deviation that is above average, indicating inconsistency in sleep onset timing. The frequency of napping is very low (Z-score of -0.08). The PSQI score of 6.0, while classifying as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and being below the population mean (Z-score of -0.33), is not alarmingly high, suggesting subjective sleep quality may be a concern but not severely impaired.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, they exhibit low levels of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high general happiness, all of which are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Their healthy BMI and above-average health satisfaction also contribute to this impression. Furthermore, engaging in reading and socializing with friends are positive behavioral indicators. However, several factors suggest a potential for elevated stress. The median sleep duration of just over 6 hours, coupled with above-average variability in sleep duration and sleep start times, points to potential sleep disturbances. While the PSQI score is not critically high, the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" aligns with the objective sleep duration metrics. The above-average alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week) could be a coping mechanism or an indicator of underlying stress.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows clear diurnal patterns, with significant physiological rest during the night, but also notable peaks in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and early evening, which could reflect times of higher stress or demanding activity. The correlation data, while not solely determinative, shows a slight positive correlation between higher perceived stress (PSS) and increased CES-D scores (0.28), STAI scores (0.31), and intradaily variability (0.16), and a negative correlation with self-esteem (-0.15) and happiness (-0.19). While the participant's individual scores in these areas are generally favorable, these correlations suggest that any worsening in these domains would indeed be associated with increased stress.

Considering the population PSS mean of 21.62, 25th percentile of 20.0, 50th percentile of 22.0, and 75th percentile of 24.0, the participant's profile, particularly the sub-optimal sleep patterns and the potential for stress-related physiological arousal in the evenings, lean towards a higher stress experience. While not overtly anxious or depressed, the sub-optimal sleep and the notable physiological responses in the later part of the day suggest that their perceived stress is unlikely to be at the very bottom of the distribution. The convergence of these factors, despite some positive psychological indicators, points towards a perceived stress level that would likely place them in the upper half of the study population.

35987,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral traits. Self-report measures indicate a moderately elevated level of trait anxiety, as evidenced by a Z-score of 0.96 on the STAI. Concurrently, self-esteem appears to be relatively lower, with a Z-score of -1.43 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Subjective well-being is mixed, with a Z-score of 0.55 for happiness, suggesting a slightly above-average self-reported state, yet a Z-score of -0.95 for health satisfaction indicates less contentment with physical health. While depressive symptoms, as measured by CES-D, fall within the non-depressed range (Z-score -0.34), the co-occurrence of higher anxiety and lower self-esteem is noteworthy. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Z-score 0.59), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score -0.81) and a median sleep start time of approximately 2:45 AM, suggesting a potential disruption in regular sleep patterns. Behavioral data reveals a low engagement in physical activity, with 'Exercised Alone,' 'Exercised with Others,' and 'Sports' all reported as 'Not at all' and exhibiting significantly low Z-scores (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). Conversely, sedentary behaviors are more prevalent, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' at 1-2 hours daily (Z-score 1.28) and 'Internet Usage' at 2-3 hours daily (Z-score 0.85). Socializing with friends occurs for approximately 31 minutes an hour, with a Z-score of -0.62 indicating less frequent engagement in this behavior. Substance usage is moderate for beer (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01), while wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs are not used.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal certain patterns in daily rhythms. The participant's resting heart rate is within the typical range (Z-score -0.11). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a mesor (average daily heart rate) that is slightly above average (Z-score 0.56) and a higher than average amplitude (Z-score 1.16), suggesting a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is estimated to be around 7:04 PM. Heart rate deviation from the mesor displays notable patterns throughout the day. Particularly high positive deviations are observed during late evening and night hours (e.g., 9-10 PM: Z=2.27, 10-11 PM: Z=1.52, 11 PM-12 AM: Z=2.20, 12 AM-1 AM: Z=1.72, 6 PM-7 PM: Z=1.36, 7 PM-8 PM: Z=1.46), indicating elevated cardiovascular activity during these periods relative to the daily average. Conversely, very low deviations are observed in the early morning hours (e.g., 5-6 AM: Z=-1.30, 4-5 AM: Z=-0.92, 3-4 AM: Z=-0.29), consistent with a period of physiological rest. Intradaily variability is relatively high (Z-score 0.81), while interdaily stability is also notably high (Z-score 1.74), suggesting consistent daily patterns in heart rate, despite the potential for irregular sleep start times. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderate (Z-score 0.48), indicating some degree of day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall in the top 50% of the study population distribution. Evidence for elevated stress includes a significantly higher than average trait anxiety score (STAI Z=0.96) and a relatively lower self-esteem score (RSES Z=-1.43). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z=0.59), coupled with a shorter than average median sleep duration (Z=-0.81) and a late median sleep start time (around 2:45 AM). These indicators of poor sleep are often associated with increased perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits low engagement in beneficial behaviors such as exercise (Z-scores significantly below 0) and relatively lower frequency in socializing with friends. The physiological data reveals elevated heart rate deviations during late evening and overnight hours, potentially reflecting ongoing physiological arousal that could contribute to perceived stress, especially in conjunction with sleep disturbances. While some metrics like health satisfaction and happiness are not drastically skewed, the combination of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, and low engagement in health-promoting behaviors strongly suggests an overall higher perceived stress level.

79341,15.0,0.038860103626943004,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a relatively stable profile with some notable characteristics. Their STAI-Trait score of 41.0 indicates a tendency towards anxiety, although this score is very close to the population mean (Z-score of -0.03), suggesting it is not a significant outlier. Similarly, their CES-D score of 10.0 falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification and is slightly below the population mean (Z-score of -0.34). Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is at 39.0, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score of 0.11), indicating positive self-regard. Subjective health satisfaction is reported at 3.89, marginally below the population mean (Z-score of -0.28). Notably, the participant reports very low levels of substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs), with Z-scores ranging from -0.31 to -1.30, indicating a significantly lower usage than the average participant. In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in exercise three times a week or more (Exercised Alone, Z-score 1.07), and 1-2 times a week for Exercised with Others and Sports, suggesting a higher than average engagement in physical activity compared to the study population. Daily recreational habits show a moderate to high engagement in watching TV/Videos/Movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64), listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.67), and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.16). They also report spending a substantial amount of time on video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 1.71), which is notably higher than the population average. Conversely, their engagement in reading and sedentary hobbies is very low or absent.

The wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data present a more complex picture. The participant's resting heart rate is 48.25 bpm, which is below the population mean (Z-score of -1.18), suggesting a potentially lower resting cardiovascular load. The Mesor of their heart rate rhythm is 64.24, which is also below the population mean (Z-score of -1.32). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 10.19, which is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.19). Sleep duration averages 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is below the population median (Z-score of -0.51), indicating a tendency towards shorter sleep. Sleep start time variability is also somewhat reduced (68 minutes, Z-score of -0.32). The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is 0.52 (Z-score 0.91), suggesting a relatively structured daily pattern, while intradaily variability is 0.59 (Z-score 0.32), indicating a moderate level of variation within the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.44 (Z-score 0.98), further supporting a regular daily rhythm. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours, reaching their lowest point between 4-5 AM (deviation of -24.83, Z-score -1.11). Heart rate then gradually increases throughout the morning and peaks in the early afternoon, with the largest positive deviations observed between 12-1 PM (deviation 20.05, Z-score 1.87) and 1-2 PM (deviation 15.79, Z-score 1.27). Heart rate remains elevated in the late afternoon and evening before declining again. This pattern suggests a clear diurnal variation in cardiovascular activity, with a pronounced afternoon peak. The correlation analysis indicates that higher Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores are associated with a greater deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM correlation 0.19, 5-6 AM correlation 0.21, 6-7 AM correlation 0.19), as well as higher scores on the STAI (anxiety) and CES-D (depressive symptoms).

Given the data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score would likely fall within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. While the participant exhibits a tendency towards anxiety (STAI score) and reports slightly lower than average happiness (Happy score), these are not extreme values and show minimal positive correlation with PSS. Furthermore, their PSQI score indicates good sleep quality and low sleep disturbance, which is generally associated with lower perceived stress. Their low substance usage, relatively healthy lifestyle choices (regular exercise), and moderate engagement in social activities and music listening also contribute to factors typically associated with lower stress. Although their sleep duration is slightly below the population median, it does not appear to be a significant stressor. The wearable data shows a regular circadian rhythm with a notable afternoon heart rate peak, but the correlations with PSS are not uniformly indicative of high stress during these periods. The most significant correlations with higher PSS scores appear to be related to specific late-night/early-morning heart rate deviations and psychological measures, but the overall profile suggests a generally managed stress level.

83536,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates low levels of both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI score of 26.0, Z-score -1.51). Self-esteem is within the average range, with a score of 41.0 and a Z-score of 0.4, suggesting a slightly above-average level of self-worth. Notably, the participant reports high levels of happiness (Current happiness score of 5.0, Z-score 1.64), which aligns with their low scores on measures of depression and anxiety. Health satisfaction is also elevated (Score of 6.0, Z-score 1.3), suggesting a positive self-perception of physical well-being.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer consumed less than once or twice a month and wine or liquor consumed one to two times a month, and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use reported. Exercise habits include exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, with no participation in sports. Daily recreation includes substantial engagement in listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), and moderate amounts of internet usage (1-2 hours) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours). Time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is minimal, and sedentary hobbies are not engaged in.

From the wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm appears relatively stable, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.41 (Z-score 0.0) and an Intradaily Variability of 0.65 (Z-score 0.74), suggesting a moderate degree of daily regularity and variability in heart rate. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is 74.23 bpm (Z-score 0.04), which is very close to the population mean. The Amplitude of 10.55 bpm (Z-score -0.07) indicates a moderate daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded as 5:12 PM. The resting heart rate is 56.4 bpm (Z-score -0.21), which is slightly below the population average.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern. The most pronounced negative deviations, indicating lower-than-average heart rate for those times, occur during the late night and early morning hours, specifically between 3 AM and 8 AM, with the largest negative deviation of -23.37 occurring between 6-7 AM. Conversely, positive deviations, indicating higher-than-average heart rate, are observed during the afternoon and early evening, particularly between 12 PM and 2 PM, and again from 6 PM to 10 PM, with the peak positive deviation of 14.46 occurring between 7-8 PM. This pattern suggests a period of reduced physiological arousal during the typical sleep window and increased arousal during waking hours, particularly in the afternoon and evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score -0.13), which is close to the population average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 84 minutes (Z-score -0.39), suggesting relatively consistent sleep durations. However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 2:25 AM (Z-score 0.35 for the standard deviation), with a considerable variability in sleep start times (99 minutes, Z-score 0.35). This late and variable sleep schedule, combined with a PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-Score -0.33) which indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" suggests potential disruptions in sleep regularity.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To assess the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score placement within the study population, we examine available data. The population PSS mean is 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68. The 50th percentile (median) is 22.0, and the 75th percentile is 24.0. Therefore, a PSS score of 22.0 or higher would place the participant in the top 50% of the distribution, indicating elevated perceived stress. A score below 22.0 would place them in the bottom 50%, indicating lower or average perceived stress.

Several indicators suggest a potentially lower PSS score. The participant exhibits low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.51), both of which are often correlated with higher perceived stress. Their reported happiness is high (Z-score 1.64), and health satisfaction is also elevated (Z-score 1.3). These psychological markers are generally associated with lower stress levels. Furthermore, their academic performance (GPA ranging from 3.5 to 3.83) is strong, which could contribute to lower perceived academic stress.

However, some aspects of the data might suggest a moderate or potentially higher stress experience, although not definitively. The PSQI score of 6.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicates subjective sleep quality issues. While the median sleep duration is adequate, the late median sleep start time (2:25 AM) and its variability, along with a higher standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score 0.35), point to potential chronobiological misalignment. The intradaily variability of heart rate is relatively high (Z-score 0.74), which could reflect periods of physiological activation, though this is balanced by a low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.21) and a mesor close to average. The correlation between Intradaily Variability and PSS is positive (0.16), suggesting that higher variability might be associated with increased stress.

Considering the strong evidence of low psychological distress (low depression, low anxiety, high happiness) and positive self-regard, alongside good academic performance, these factors tend to weigh heavily against a high perceived stress score. While sleep disturbance is present, its impact on PSS is not directly elucidated by a strong negative correlation with the available metrics, and the other indicators of well-being appear dominant. The participant's self-reported psychological state strongly leans towards lower stress.

Holistically, the pervasive indicators of positive psychological well-being (low depression and anxiety, high happiness, good self-esteem and health satisfaction) provide a robust foundation for inferring a PSS score below the median. While sleep quality and timing present areas for potential improvement, they do not appear to be overriding factors contributing to significantly elevated perceived stress in this participant's overall profile. Therefore, it is most likely that the participant's PSS score falls within the bottom 50% of the study population.

67608,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of behavioral and physiological markers that inform an understanding of their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.28) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.51), suggesting a generally positive psychological disposition in these areas. Self-esteem is at the higher end of the spectrum (RSES Z-score: 0.96), while self-reported happiness is notably elevated (Happy Z-score: 1.64). Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.22), and trust in others is moderate (Trust Z-score: 0.5). Academically, the participant demonstrates high achievement with GPAs consistently at or near 4.0.

Lifestyle habits suggest moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity levels are robust, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more and sports participation 1-2 times a week. However, exercise with others is infrequent (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits show limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos or playing video games, and relatively low time spent on internet usage. Notably, time spent socializing with friends is minimal (15 minutes or less), and the participant reports not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data provides further insight into physiological and circadian patterns. The participant's interdaily stability, reflecting the regularity of daily activity patterns, is slightly above average (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.58). Conversely, intradaily variability is elevated (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.58), indicating greater fluctuations in activity within a 24-hour period, which could be indicative of more dynamic or potentially disrupted daily routines. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below average (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: -0.28), suggesting a less consistent daily rhythm over time. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is below average (Mesor Z-score: -0.78), and the amplitude, reflecting the extent of daily heart rate variation, is also slightly below average (Amplitude Z-score: -0.19). The resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.54).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. There is a notable increase in heart rate deviation during late evening hours (e.g., 8-9 PM, Z-score: 2.32; 10-11 PM, Z-score: 1.49) and morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score: 1.48; 10-11 AM, Z-score: 1.36). Conversely, significant dips in heart rate deviation are observed during deep sleep hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score: -1.72; 2-3 AM, Z-score: -1.68). The acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian rhythm, is reported at 4:08 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration very close to the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.02) and a slightly below-average standard deviation in sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.98), suggesting relatively consistent sleep duration. However, the median sleep start time is notably late (around 1:14 AM), with a low standard deviation, indicating a consistent but late sleep schedule. The frequency of daily naps is slightly above average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.61). Subjectively, the PSQI score suggests disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-Score: 0.13), though this is close to the population average.

Correlations between these metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score provide context for their potential influence. Higher PSS scores are positively correlated with greater intradaily variability (r = 0.16) and higher CES-D (r = 0.28) and STAI scores (r = 0.31), indicating that increased physiological variability, depressive symptoms, and anxiety proneness are associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, higher PSS scores are negatively correlated with self-esteem (r = -0.15), happiness (r = -0.19), and time spent reading (r = -0.21), suggesting that lower self-worth, happiness, and engagement in reading are linked to elevated stress.

The participant's PSS score is likely in the bottom 50% of the study population. While certain metrics like elevated intradaily variability and a late, consistent sleep schedule might suggest potential stress, the overwhelming majority of self-reported psychological indicators (low depression, low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness) point towards a generally low perceived stress level. The positive academic performance and moderate lifestyle habits further support this interpretation. The negative correlations between PSS and positive psychological states like self-esteem and happiness, along with positive correlations between PSS and negative states like depression and anxiety, align with the participant's profile of generally low scores in these negative indicators. The presence of disturbances in sleep quality is noted, but its Z-score is close to the population average, and its correlation with PSS is not provided. The overall constellation of data, particularly the strong positive self-report measures, suggests that the participant experiences relatively low perceived stress compared to their peers.

19735,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several self-reported psychological and lifestyle characteristics that may be associated with perceived stress. Notably, the participant reports a CES-D score of 34.0, which places them in the ""Depressed"" classification and represents a Z-score of 2.15, indicating a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms compared to the study population. This is further supported by a STAI trait anxiety score of 47.0 (Z-score = 0.56), suggesting a proneness to anxiety. While self-esteem is relatively average with a score of 31.0 (Z-score = -1.01), indicating a slightly lower than average self-worth, trust in others is also below the population average (Score = 2.67, Z-score = -1.1). Happiness levels are slightly below average as well (Current = 3.0, Z-score = -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant reports consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, with a higher frequency of recreational drug use (1-2 times a month, Z-score = 3.52). Exercise habits are limited, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a week and exercising with others and sports participation reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational activities are primarily sedentary, with low engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music. Notably, internet usage, socializing with friends, and reading are engaged in for 15 minutes or less, indicating very limited engagement in these common leisure activities.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits some notable characteristics. The Mesor (mean resting heart rate) is 75.1 (Z-score = 0.16), which is slightly above average. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is 14.29 (Z-score = 1.13), suggesting a larger than average daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is at 5:26 PM, aligning with typical diurnal patterns. However, the interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is 0.42 (Z-score = 0.09), indicating a moderate level of regularity in daily patterns. Intradaily variability is 0.51 (Z-score = -0.25), suggesting a relatively lower variability within the day compared to the population, which could imply a less dynamic physiological response throughout the day. The resting heart rate is 50.3 (Z-score = -0.93), which is below the population average, potentially indicating a good baseline cardiovascular fitness.

An examination of the hourly deviations from the Mesor reveals patterns of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits significantly lower heart rates than expected during the early morning hours, particularly between 3 AM and 8 AM, with deviations ranging from -25.59 (4-5 AM, Z-score = -1.24) to -19.74 (8-9 AM, Z-score = -1.5). This suggests a prolonged period of low physiological activity during typical wakeful hours. Conversely, there is increased physiological arousal during late morning and afternoon hours, with positive deviations from the Mesor starting around 10 AM and peaking at 11 AM-12 PM (14.29, Z-score = 1.3) and continuing through the afternoon until about 8 PM. This pattern suggests a potential shift in the timing of peak physiological activity towards the latter part of the day.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score = 0.77), which is slightly longer than average. However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:01:45 AM, with a standard deviation of 77 minutes, indicating variability in sleep onset. While the PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-score = -0.33) suggests generally ""Disturbed Sleep,"" this is not a significantly elevated score relative to the population. The average daily nap frequency is very low (0.08, Z-score = 0.04).

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, the extremely high CES-D score (Z-score = 2.15) strongly suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms, which are often correlated with elevated perceived stress. The moderate anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score = 0.56) and slightly lower than average self-esteem and happiness further contribute to a profile consistent with higher stress levels. The very limited engagement in social activities and sedentary daily habits, coupled with the late sleep start time, could also be indicative of stress-related avoidance or disruption of healthy routines.

However, several physiological metrics do not unequivocally point to high stress. The resting heart rate is below average, and while the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is high, the intraday variability is relatively low. The median sleep duration is also somewhat longer than average, which could be a compensatory mechanism or simply reflective of individual sleep needs.

Considering the population's PSS score distribution, where the 50th percentile (median) is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, the strong indicators of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety are highly suggestive of a PSS score that falls within the top 50% of the distribution. The CES-D score, in particular, has a positive correlation with PSS (0.29), indicating that higher depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress. While some physiological metrics are not as clearly aligned with high stress, the substantial psychological distress indicated by the CES-D and STAI scores strongly outweighs these mitigating factors. Therefore, it is likely that this participant experiences a perceived stress level that places them in the upper half of the study population.

59207,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data present a complex profile. On measures of psychological well-being, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.34) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.43), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" respectively. Self-esteem is moderately high, with a Z-score of 0.68, indicating a score above the population mean. Despite this, health satisfaction is notably elevated (Z-score: 1.3), suggesting a positive outlook on their physical health. Happiness is reported as relatively low (Z-score: -0.53), which contrasts with their self-esteem and health satisfaction. Substance use patterns indicate moderate consumption of beer (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01) but infrequent use of wine or liquor. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as ""Not at all."" In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in regular exercise, specifically exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score: 1.07), and participates in sports and exercises with others weekly. Sedentary behaviors are prominent, with significant time spent on video games (2-3 hours, Z-score: 2.47) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85), while dedicated time for reading and listening to music is minimal.

The wearable-derived physiological data reveals insights into the participant's circadian rhythm and activity patterns. The individual exhibits a highly stable circadian rhythm, indicated by a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 1.24) and very low Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -2.08), suggesting a predictable daily structure. The Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Z-score: 0.34), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also higher (Z-score: 1.05), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (5:58 PM). The resting heart rate is also slightly above average (Z-score: 0.39). Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a typical pattern of lower heart rate during early morning sleep hours, with deviations becoming increasingly positive (indicating higher than average heart rate) during the afternoon and evening, peaking in the late evening hours (e.g., 10-11 PM with a Z-score of 1.37). This pattern suggests physiological activation during waking hours, particularly in the latter half of the day.

Sleep statistics indicate a robust sleep duration, with a median of 8 hours and 13 minutes (Z-score: 1.28), which is significantly longer than the population average. However, the variability in sleep duration (standard deviation: 169 minutes, Z-score: 1.55) and sleep start time (standard deviation: 141 minutes, Z-score: 1.27) is considerably high, suggesting inconsistency in sleep timing despite sufficient duration. The median sleep start time is late in the night (1:34 AM). The absence of daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) is noteworthy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, with a Z-score of 0.59, indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" which, in conjunction with the variability in sleep start times, suggests potential issues with sleep regularity despite adequate overall duration. The correlations between many of these metrics and perceived stress are generally weak and inconsistent, with a few notable exceptions. For instance, lower self-reported happiness (Score Correlation: -0.19) and a tendency towards more reading (Score Correlation: -0.21) are weakly negatively correlated with PSS. Conversely, greater variance in sleep duration (Score Correlation: 0.14) and more erratic sleep start times (Score Correlation: 0.17) show a weak positive correlation with perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine the participant's placement within the study population's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) distribution, we consider various indicators. The population mean PSS is 21.62, with a median of 22.0, indicating that scores around this value are typical. Elevated perceived stress would place the participant in the top 50% of the distribution (above 22.0), while low or average stress would place them in the bottom 50% (at or below 22.0).

Evidence supporting a potentially higher PSS score is present in the participant's reported sleep patterns. While sleep duration is ample, the significant variability in both sleep duration and sleep start times, coupled with a PSQI score indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" and moderate correlations with PSS, suggests an underlying irregularity that could contribute to heightened stress. The higher-than-average amplitude of their heart rate circadian rhythm and elevated average heart rate, along with pronounced increases in heart rate during evening hours, could also reflect a physiological state of heightened arousal or difficulty in down-regulating, which can be associated with stress. Furthermore, the participant's low self-reported happiness, despite high self-esteem and health satisfaction, might indicate a more nuanced internal experience where underlying stress is not fully captured by these other positive self-assessments.

Conversely, several factors suggest a potentially lower or median PSS score. The participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, and their academic performance (GPA) is strong. Their trust in others is also close to the population average. The high stability of their circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability) and very low intradaily variability indicate a structured and predictable daily routine, which is generally associated with lower stress. Regular engagement in physical activity is also a known stress buffer. The mild deviation of their resting heart rate and average heart rate from the population mean are not alarmingly high.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant exhibits some indicators suggestive of elevated stress, particularly related to sleep irregularity and physiological arousal patterns during the evening. However, their generally positive self-reported psychological states (low depression, low anxiety, high self-esteem), strong academic performance, and stable circadian rhythm point towards a more resilient profile. The correlations between most metrics and PSS are weak, with sleep variability being the most consistently, albeit weakly, associated with higher stress. Given the population median PSS is 22.0, and the participant exhibits a balance of potentially stress-exacerbating factors (sleep irregularity, evening arousal) and stress-mitigating factors (low depression/anxiety, routine stability, physical activity), it is most likely that their overall perceived stress level falls within the average range, placing them in the bottom 50% of the distribution.

Self-reported data indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72), aligning with a classification of ""not anxious."" Self-esteem appears to be within a normative range, though a positive Z-score of 0.96 suggests it might be slightly elevated compared to the study population, which generally correlates negatively with perceived stress. Subjective health satisfaction is also moderately high (Z-score: 1.05), suggesting a generally positive outlook on physical well-being. However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 suggests disturbed sleep, with a Z-score of -0.33 indicating it is slightly better than the average for the population, despite the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" This implies that while subjective sleep quality is an issue, it may not be as severe as for other participants in the study. Happiness levels are also reported as slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53).

Behavioral patterns reveal a moderate engagement in substance use, with beer consumption at ""1-2 times a week"" being higher than the average (Z-score: 1.01), while wine/liquor and drug use are within or below normative levels. Exercise habits are mixed, with no reported solo exercise (Z-score: -1.93) but frequent exercise with others (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score: 1.23) and regular participation in sports (""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational habits show a substantial amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64) and playing video games (Z-score: 0.96), suggesting a tendency towards sedentary leisure activities. Conversely, internet usage is below average (Z-score: -0.49), and listening to music and reading are less frequent than the average (Z-scores: -0.72 and -0.67 respectively). Notably, sedentary hobbies are reported as being engaged in for ""1-2 hours"" (Z-score: 1.41), contributing to a generally higher engagement in less active pursuits.

Physiological data from the wearable device paints a picture of a relatively regular circadian rhythm, indicated by a high amplitude (Z-score: 1.26) and a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.33). The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is below the population average (Z-score: -0.86), suggesting a lower baseline heart rate. The resting heart rate is also notably low (Z-score: -1.23), which could be indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon, around 5:26 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during the afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 2-3 PM: Z=2.21, 3-4 PM: Z=2.02, 8-9 PM: Z=1.49, 9-10 PM: Z=1.43) and reduced heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z=-0.91, 4-5 AM: Z=-1.11, 5-6 AM: Z=-1.13, 6-7 AM: Z=-1.29). This pattern suggests a typical diurnal fluctuation in cardiovascular activity, with heightened arousal in the evening. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score: 1.61), but also a higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.53) and a less stable sleep start time (Z-score: -1.06), with the median start time occurring late at 1:31 AM. The presence of naps, though infrequent, is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.94).

Considering the overall profile, the participant presents with generally favorable psychological indicators such as low depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem. However, notable areas for attention include disturbed sleep quality, a tendency towards sedentary recreational activities, and increased consumption of beer. Physiologically, while circadian rhythmicity is robust, the elevated heart rate deviations in the evening and late sleep start times warrant consideration. The negative correlation between higher perceived stress and reading habits (-0.21) and positive correlation with intradaily variability (0.16) might suggest that reduced engagement in reading and less predictable daily physiological patterns are associated with higher stress. The positive correlation between stress and CES-D (0.28), STAI (0.31), and resting heart rate (0.14) suggests that even though these scores are currently low, they are trending in a direction that could be indicative of emerging stress. Conversely, higher self-esteem (-0.15), health satisfaction (-0.08), and trust ( -0.04) are associated with lower stress, which is beneficial for this participant. Given the presence of disturbed sleep, specific behavioral patterns, and the generally positive correlations between some indicators and perceived stress, it is plausible that the participant falls within the upper half of the distribution regarding their Perceived Stress Scale score, suggesting elevated stress levels despite some positive self-reported psychological attributes.

Health satisfaction is notably high, with a score of 5.56 and a z-score of 0.97, implying a strong positive outlook on physical health. Trust in others is slightly below average, with a score of 3.0 and a z-score of -0.46, but shows a negligible correlation with perceived stress (-0.04).

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed picture. The participant reports drinking beer 1-2 times a week, which is higher than the average (z-score 1.01), but infrequent consumption of wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are variable: while exercising alone is infrequent (z-score -1.18), exercising with others occurs three times a week or more (z-score 1.23), and participation in sports is moderate (z-score 0.91). Correlation analyses with PSS suggest that engaging in sports and exercising with others are weakly associated with lower perceived stress. Daily recreational habits include relatively low engagement with most activities, with significant time spent on watching TV/videos/movies (z-score 0.01) and moderate internet usage (z-score -1.16). Notably, socialising with friends and reading are reported as very infrequent (z-scores -2.2 and -0.67 respectively), with reading showing a moderate negative correlation with PSS.

Physiological data from the Fitbit reveals a regular circadian rhythm characterized by moderate interdaily stability (z-score 1.41) and lower than average intradaily variability (z-score -1.16). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also high (z-score 1.57), indicating strong daily regularity. The mesor of 78.81 (z-score 0.66) and amplitude of 15.81 (z-score 1.63) suggest a moderately elevated baseline heart rate with a significant daily fluctuation. The acrophase, at 5:23 PM, indicates the peak heart rate typically occurs in the late afternoon. The resting heart rate is very close to the population average (z-score -0.01). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows distinct patterns. During nighttime hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), heart rates are significantly below the mesor, suggesting deep rest. A notable pattern emerges in the afternoon and evening, with significant elevations in heart rate deviation from the mesor, particularly between 3-4 PM (z-score 2.58) and 6-8 PM (z-score 1.43 and 1.35 respectively). This period of elevated cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon and early evening, coinciding with the reported peak in amplitude, may reflect periods of higher physiological arousal or stress response. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 29 minutes (z-score 0.37), which is slightly longer than average, with a low standard deviation in sleep duration (z-score -0.03) suggesting consistent sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is 1:27 AM, which is relatively late, and its standard deviation of 54 minutes indicates some variability in sleep onset. The PSQI score of 7.0 classifies sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite the relatively good objective duration, suggesting subjective sleep quality issues.

Overall, the participant demonstrates generally positive psychological traits such as high self-esteem and low anxiety, which might be protective factors against high stress. However, certain behavioral patterns and physiological indicators suggest potential areas of concern. The late sleep start time, subjective sleep disturbance, and pronounced elevations in heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening hours are noteworthy. These physiological patterns, particularly the heightened cardiovascular activity during specific times of the day, could be indicative of stress responses. While the correlation analyses with PSS are varied, the significant negative correlation with reading time (-0.21) and the weak negative correlations with sports and exercising with others suggest these activities might be beneficial for stress management. The overall picture is of an individual with a strong internal psychological foundation but potentially experiencing environmental or behavioral factors that contribute to physiological arousal at specific times, and subjective sleep disruption. Considering the population PSS data, where the 50th percentile is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, a moderate to high stress level would place the participant above 22.0. While no direct PSS score is provided, the combination of subjective sleep disturbance, notable physiological arousal patterns in the afternoon/evening, and moderate engagement in some stress-mitigating activities (like reading) alongside less frequent engagement in others (socializing) suggests that perceived stress could be elevated.

71089,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by elevated levels of reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, as indicated by their STAI and CESD scores, respectively. The STAI score of 46.0 is above the median for trait anxiety, with a Z-score of 0.46 suggesting a slightly elevated proneness to anxiety compared to the study population. Similarly, the CESD score of 16.0, with a Z-score of 0.28, indicates a mild burden of depressive symptoms. These findings are congruent with the lower than average self-esteem (Z-score of -1.57) and health satisfaction (Z-score of -1.45), and lower than average self-reported happiness (Z-score of -0.53). Trust in others is also slightly lower than average (Z-score of -0.46).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a notable amount of sedentary activities. Internet usage, listening to music, and sedentary hobbies are reported for 3-4 hours daily, with internet usage having a Z-score of 1.52, indicating significantly higher than average engagement. Video game usage (16-30 minutes) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours) also show above-average engagement (Z-scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively). Conversely, the participant reports no frequency of exercising alone, exercising with others, or participating in sports, with Z-scores for these activities being substantially low (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively), suggesting a lack of structured physical activity. Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is reported at 1-2 times a month, which falls within a moderate range relative to the population.

Physiologically, the participant displays markers suggestive of a more active circadian rhythm and potentially higher basal arousal. The mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is 86.93 with a Z-score of 1.77, indicating a significantly higher average heart rate compared to the population. The resting heart rate is also elevated at 71.2 with a Z-score of 1.55. The diurnal heart rate pattern shows elevated deviations from the mesor during evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (Z-score 0.76) and 8-9 PM (Z-score 0.68), and also during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM-12 PM Z-score 0.9, 12-1 PM Z-score 0.66). This pattern, combined with a relatively high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.23), suggests a structured but potentially heightened cardiovascular response throughout the day, especially in the evening. The acrophase, the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late in the afternoon at 4:34 PM. Sleep duration is longer than average (8 hours 12 minutes, Z-score 1.26), but sleep start times are later (median 00:50:30) with moderate variability in duration and start time.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine the participant's position relative to the study population for perceived stress (PSS), we examine several key indicators. The population PSS mean is 21.62, with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. A PSS score above 22.0 would place the participant in the top 50% of the distribution.

Several factors suggest a potentially elevated PSS score. The participant reports elevated levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46) and depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.28), both of which are positively correlated with PSS scores (0.31 and 0.28 respectively). Lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.57) and health satisfaction (Z-score -1.45) also correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting that lower levels of these traits might be associated with higher perceived stress. The participant's engagement in extensive internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and listening to music (Z-score 1.6) for prolonged periods, coupled with a lack of physical exercise, could be compensatory behaviors for stress. Physiologically, the higher mesor (Z-score 1.77) and resting heart rate (Z-score 1.55) indicate a generally higher physiological arousal, which can be indicative of elevated stress. The complex diurnal heart rate patterns, with significant deviations during the evening and late morning/early afternoon, may reflect periods of heightened physiological activation, potentially linked to perceived stressors. The PSQI score of 6.0, while not markedly high (Z-score -0.33), suggests some level of sleep disturbance.

While not all indicators point definitively towards very high stress, the confluence of elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and health satisfaction, a sedentary lifestyle, and indicators of heightened physiological arousal (higher heart rates and mesor, variable diurnal patterns) collectively suggest that this participant is likely experiencing a level of perceived stress that places them in the upper half of the study population distribution. The positive correlations between anxiety, depressive symptoms, and PSS, alongside the negative correlations with self-esteem and health satisfaction, strongly support this interpretation.

22688,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits a profile characterized by several notable psychological and behavioral patterns. Self-reported measures indicate a low propensity for anxiety and depression, with the STAI score being significantly below the study population average (Z-score of -1.41) and the CES-D score also indicating a low symptom burden (Z-score of -0.86). This aligns with a classification of 'not anxious' and 'not depressed'. Self-esteem is above average (Z-score of 1.1), and the participant reports high levels of happiness (Z-score of 1.64), suggesting a generally positive psychological disposition. Health satisfaction is also notably high (Z-score of 1.22). Academic performance is strong, with GPAs consistently above 3.8.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates consistent engagement in physical activity, particularly exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.23). This contrasts with a lack of solo exercise (Z-score of -1.93). Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported at a moderate frequency of 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores above 0.9, indicating a higher prevalence within the study population. Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as 'Not at all'. Daily recreational habits show a preference for activities like video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 0.96) and moderate internet usage, with less time dedicated to listening to music or socializing with friends. Activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and reading are notably absent or minimal.

Physiological data from the wearable reveal a largely regular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability is relatively low (Z-score of -1.15), suggesting some variability in daily routines, which is further reflected in a low Intradaily Variability (Z-score of -1.8), indicating a less fragmented daily physiological pattern. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score of -1.79), potentially contributing to the low interdaily stability. The Mesor (average heart rate) is near the population mean (Z-score of -0.01), and the Amplitude is moderately below average (Z-score of -0.66). Resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.27). The hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show a distinct pattern, with lower heart rates during the night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, Z-scores ranging from 0.21 to 0.44, and a negative deviation of -18.59 at 5-6 AM), followed by a marked increase in heart rate during typical waking hours, peaking in the late morning/early afternoon (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score of 1.32). A decrease in heart rate is observed in the late evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a favorable sleep profile. The median sleep duration is above average (1.05 Z-score for '8 hours 2 minutes'), and the standard deviation for sleep duration is within the average range. The median sleep start time is late at approximately 00:33, with a moderate standard deviation, suggesting some variability in sleep onset. Importantly, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score (Z-score of -0.8), which is classified as 'Good Sleep'. The absence of daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) is consistent with a generally consolidated sleep pattern.

The correlations between these metrics and PSS scores are generally weak to moderate, with a few exceptions. Higher happiness and self-esteem are negatively correlated with PSS, which is expected. Similarly, reading as a hobby shows a negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that this activity might be associated with lower stress. Conversely, higher levels of intoxication from alcohol (wine or liquor) show a slight positive correlation, and higher intradaily variability in heart rate is also positively correlated with PSS, which is a common finding indicating physiological dysregulation potentially linked to stress.

Considering the self-reported low levels of anxiety and depression, high self-esteem and happiness, and good subjective sleep quality, alongside a generally healthy lifestyle with moderate exercise and no substance abuse, there is evidence suggesting a lower perceived stress level. The negative correlations with happiness and self-esteem, and the positive correlation with potentially stress-reducing activities like reading, further support this. While there are some behavioral indicators like moderate alcohol consumption and specific patterns in daily activities, these do not strongly point towards elevated stress in the context of the other psychological measures. The physiological data, while showing some daily rhythm variability, does not present overt signs of chronic physiological distress.

Given the analysis of the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, is likely to place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The strong indicators of positive psychological well-being, low trait anxiety and depression, and good sleep quality, combined with generally weak or negative correlations with stress-related metrics, collectively suggest a relatively low to average stress experience.

38815,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant presents with a moderate level of anxiety, as indicated by their STAI trait anxiety score (Score: 43.0, Z-score: 0.17), which falls slightly above the population average. This is accompanied by generally lower-than-average trust in others (Score: 2.5, Z-score: -1.42). Their self-esteem is within the normative range for the study population (Score: 38.0, Z-score: -0.03), and current self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Current: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55). Notably, the participant reports experiencing disturbed sleep, as evidenced by their PSQI score (Score: 7.0, Z-Score: 0.13), which suggests potential challenges with sleep quality. Their CES-D score (Score: 11.0, Z-score: -0.24) indicates a low frequency of depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 1.01) and less frequent wine or liquor consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a month, Z-Score: 0.19). They report no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Regarding exercise, they are more active in exercising alone (Three times a week or more, Z-Score: 1.07) compared to exercising with others (Less than 1-2 times a month, Z-Score: -0.88) and do not participate in sports (Not at all, Z-Score: -1.09). Daily sedentary habits include limited time spent watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: -0.62) and playing video games (Do not do, Z-Score: -0.56). They spend a considerable amount of time on the internet (3-4 hours, Z-Score: 1.52) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-Score: 1.13), with moderate time spent socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.16) and reading (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: 0.32).

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Value: 47.5, Z-Score: -1.27), suggesting a potentially well-conditioned cardiovascular system or a generally relaxed state when at rest. Their sleep duration is close to the population average (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 3 minutes, Z-Score: -0.16), but the variability in sleep duration is higher than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation: 136 minutes, Z-Score: 0.8), which, combined with the PSQI score, could contribute to their perceived sleep disturbance. The regularity of their circadian rhythm, as measured by Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.31, Z-Score: -0.82), is below average, indicating less consistent daily patterns. Intradaily variability (Value: 0.56, Z-Score: 0.1) is near average. The Mesor (Value: 65.92, Z-Score: -1.1) is below average, and the amplitude (Value: 12.58, Z-Score: 0.58) is above average, suggesting a wider fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day relative to their daily average.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, there are significant positive deviations from the mesor during the late afternoon and early evening, particularly between 4-5 PM (Value: 22.71, Z-Score: 2.06) and 6-7 PM (Value: 22.03, Z-Score: 1.65), suggesting periods of heightened cardiovascular activity during these times. Conversely, the participant exhibits significant negative deviations during the early morning hours, peaking between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM (Values: -17.71 and -20.95 respectively), indicating periods of reduced cardiovascular activity during sleep. These patterns, coupled with the higher intraday variability and lower interdaily stability, suggest potential disruptions in their sleep-wake cycle and overall physiological rhythm.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's overall perceived stress level falls into the top or bottom half of the study population, a holistic assessment of the available data is required. The population PSS score has a median of 22.0. Evidence for a lower or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes a CES-D score within the non-depressed range and self-esteem that is not significantly low. Their resting heart rate is also below average, which can sometimes be associated with lower stress.

However, several factors suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. The participant exhibits moderate trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17), which is positively correlated with PSS in this dataset. Their subjective experience of disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score: 0.13) can be a significant contributor to stress. Furthermore, the physiological data indicates less stable circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.82) and higher variability in heart rate throughout the day (Amplitude Z-score: 0.58), particularly with pronounced peaks in heart rate deviation during late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 4-5 PM Z-score: 2.06). These physiological patterns, combined with the moderate anxiety and sleep disturbance, suggest a state of heightened physiological arousal and potential stress response. The strong positive correlation between the STAI score and PSS (0.31) further supports this. While not exhibiting overt depressive symptoms, the combination of anxiety, disturbed sleep, and less stable physiological rhythms points towards a potentially elevated stress experience.

Considering the interplay between psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators, particularly the presence of moderate anxiety, disturbed sleep, and evidence of physiological dysregulation, it is likely that this participant falls into the upper half of the study population regarding their Perceived Stress Scale score.

72885,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that may influence their perceived stress levels. Notably, their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) place them in the 'anxious' classification, with a Z-score of 0.46, indicating a moderate level of chronic anxiety proneness relative to the study population. This is further corroborated by a relatively low self-esteem score (Z-score of -1.01) on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, suggesting a potential vulnerability to stress. While the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score indicates they are not clinically depressed (Z-score of 0.18), the positive correlation between CES-D and PSS (0.28) suggests that even sub-clinical depressive symptoms could be associated with higher perceived stress.

Sleep metrics reveal a significant disturbance. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0, with a Z-score of 1.98, places them in the 'Disturbed Sleep' category and indicates a substantial deviation from the population norm, suggesting poor subjective sleep quality. Objectively, the median sleep duration is 5 hours and 59 minutes, with a Z-score of -1.5, indicating significantly shorter sleep than the average participant. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is notably late at 03:43:59. These sleep irregularities are likely contributing factors to stress, given the strong negative correlation between median sleep duration and PSS (-0.05, though this correlation is weak, the objective shortness of sleep is salient).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in recreational drug use (Z-score of 5.44), which could be a coping mechanism for stress or a contributing factor to it. Conversely, their engagement in exercising with others is notably low (Z-score of -1.58), and participation in sports is also infrequent (Z-score of -1.09), suggesting limited engagement in potentially stress-reducing social activities. Their daily recreation habits include substantial time spent playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score of 2.47), which, while a leisure activity, might indicate a preference for solitary or screen-based activities over more social or physically demanding ones.

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively lower mesor (average heart rate) of 68.55 (Z-score of -0.74) and a diminished amplitude of 7.68 (Z-score of -1.0), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs late in the evening at 6:38 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals heightened deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM), indicating periods of elevated physiological arousal during times typically associated with rest. This pattern, coupled with the short sleep duration, suggests a potential misalignment between the individual's circadian rhythm and their sleep schedule, which can exacerbate stress. The overall interdaily stability of their activity rhythm is low (Z-score of -1.32), indicating a lack of regularity in daily routines, which is often associated with higher stress levels.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is present in several areas. The participant exhibits elevated anxiety traits (STAI Z-score of 0.46) and relatively low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of -1.01), both of which are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Significant sleep disturbances, as indicated by the high PSQI score (Z-score of 1.98) and objectively short sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -1.5), are strong indicators of elevated stress. The low interdaily stability of their activity rhythm (Z-score of -1.32) further supports a potentially disorganized and stressful lifestyle. Additionally, the high frequency of recreational drug use (Z-score of 5.44) could be a behavioral indicator of attempts to cope with significant stress. The physiological data, with elevated heart rate deviations during late night/early morning hours and low circadian amplitude, suggests physiological dysregulation that can amplify stress responses.

Conversely, evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is less pronounced. While their CES-D score is not clinically depressed (Z-score of 0.18), the positive correlation with PSS suggests it could still contribute to stress. Their GPA scores are within a moderate range, and their reported happiness is slightly above average (Current Happiness Z-score of 0.55), which might suggest some protective factors, though the correlation with PSS is moderately negative (-0.19). Their trust score is low (Z-score of -1.42), which is generally associated with lower stress, but the correlation with PSS is negligible (-0.04).

Holistically, the converging evidence from psychological traits (anxiety, self-esteem), sleep patterns, behavioral habits (substance use, low social/physical activity), and physiological indicators (circadian rhythm, heart rate variability) strongly suggests that this participant is experiencing a high level of perceived stress. The objective measures of sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm disruption, combined with psychological vulnerabilities and maladaptive coping behaviors, point towards a significant burden of perceived stress that likely places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

These findings are particularly noteworthy given the classification of ""Depressed"" and ""anxious"" for these respective scales. Conversely, self-esteem (RSES score of 28.0, Z-score of -1.43) and general happiness (Happy score of 2.0, Z-score of -1.61) are reported at levels below the study population mean, suggesting a lower sense of self-worth and reduced subjective well-being. Trust in others is also relatively low (Trust score of 2.5, Z-score of -1.42). Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score of 3.56, Z-score of -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a significant amount of video gaming (1-2 hours daily, Z-score of 2.47) and moderate internet usage (1-2 hours daily, Z-score of 0.18) and listening to music (1-2 hours daily, Z-score of 0.67). Daily recreational reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score of -0.67), and social interaction with friends is limited to 31 minutes an hour (Z-score of -0.62). Physical activity is minimal; exercise alone occurs 1-2 times a month (Z-score of -0.43), and exercise with others and participation in sports are reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-scores of -1.58 and -1.09, respectively). Substance usage across all reported categories (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""Not at all.""

From the wearable data, the participant demonstrates a relatively stable and regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high Interdaily Stability (Value of 0.6, Z-score of 1.57) and a low Intradaily Variability (Value of 0.37, Z-score of -1.24). The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also high (Value of 0.54, Z-score of 1.82), further reinforcing the regularity of their daily patterns. The Mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint) is within the average range (Value of 75.33, Z-score of 0.19), and the Amplitude (peak to trough variation) is moderately elevated (Value of 13.74, Z-score of 0.96), suggesting a notable daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurs in the late afternoon at 5:49 PM. The resting heart rate is within the typical range (Value of 59.0, Z-score of 0.1).

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns. Notably, there are substantial positive deviations during the afternoon and early evening hours, peaking between 2-3 PM (Z-score of 2.28) and 3-4 PM (Z-score of 2.01). This indicates a physiological response characterized by increased cardiovascular activity during these periods. Conversely, heart rate deviations are consistently negative during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 9 AM, with the most pronounced negative deviations observed between 3 AM and 8 AM. This pattern suggests periods of physiological rest or reduced arousal during the typical sleep window.

Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 2 minutes, Z-score of 1.05) but with considerable variability (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation of 55 minutes, Z-score of -1.04). The median sleep start time is quite late (1:47:30 AM), with moderate variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation of 41 minutes, Z-score of -0.93). The participant also reports a moderate frequency of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps of 0.19, Z-score of 1.34). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 with a Z-score of 0.59 indicates a level of disturbed sleep, aligning with the subjective experience of poorer sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest an elevated level of perceived stress, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population. The most compelling evidence stems from the significantly elevated scores on the CES-D (depression symptoms) and STAI (anxiety proneness) scales. These measures are strongly correlated with perceived stress and their elevated values, particularly the high Z-scores, indicate a considerable burden of psychological distress. This is further supported by lower-than-average self-esteem and happiness scores, which are often associated with higher stress levels.

While the participant demonstrates a regular circadian rhythm from wearable data, which might typically be associated with lower stress, the pronounced physiological response indicated by elevated heart rate deviations during the afternoon and early evening, coupled with periods of significant physiological suppression overnight, could reflect an underlying dysregulation or response to stressors. The reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score) and significant engagement in solitary, sedentary activities like video gaming, alongside minimal social interaction and physical activity, also contribute to an overall profile suggestive of stress. The relatively late sleep onset and moderate variability in sleep duration, despite a longer median sleep duration, may also be indicative of difficulties in establishing restorative sleep patterns, often exacerbated by stress. The absence of substance use and near-average resting heart rate are mitigating factors but do not outweigh the significant psychological and behavioral indicators of heightened stress.

Self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological profile, with a low score on the CES-D (7.0, Z = -0.66), suggesting a low burden of depressive symptoms. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score (33.0, Z = -0.82) indicates a low proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is relatively high (44.0, Z = 0.82), and self-reported happiness is notably elevated (5.0, Z = 1.64), placing them in the upper echelon of the study population for this metric. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (3.56, Z = -0.53). The participant reports no substance usage across categories, and while they exercise alone three times a week or more (Z = 1.07), they do not engage in exercise with others or participate in sports. Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes) and socializing with friends (16-30 minutes), with minimal time spent on video games, internet usage, listening to music, or reading.

However, intradaily variability is relatively high (0.67, Z = 0.88), suggesting significant fluctuations in physiological activity throughout the day. The participant's mesor (71.71, Z = -0.3) is slightly below the population average, and their resting heart rate is also lower than average (53.05, Z = -0.61). The amplitude of heart rate variation is high (15.86, Z = 1.64), suggesting a significant diurnal range in cardiovascular activity, peaking in the evening with an acrophase around 6:32 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals pronounced elevations in heart rate during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 8-9 PM: Z=2.91, 9-10 PM: Z=0.54, 10-11 PM: Z=1.68, 11 PM-12 AM: Z=2.28), contrasting with lower-than-average heart rates during early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM: Z=-0.79, 5-6 AM: Z=-0.99, 6-7 AM: Z=-1.24). This pattern may reflect a delayed sleep phase or difficulties winding down in the evening. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes (Z = -0.39), which is slightly below the population median, and a moderate standard deviation in sleep duration (102 minutes, Z = 0.02). The median sleep start time is late at 1:58 AM (Z = -0.4), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (65 minutes, Z = -0.4). The participant also reports occasional napping (0.12 daily naps, Z = 0.61). The PSQI score of 9.0 (Z = 1.05) categorizes their sleep as disturbed, aligning with the late sleep onset and potentially insufficient duration.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall in the **bottom 50%** of the study population. This assessment is based on a confluence of indicators. While the PSQI score suggests disturbed sleep, the majority of self-report measures point towards a low-stress profile. Specifically, the low scores on the CES-D and STAI-Trait, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, are strong indicators of relatively low perceived stress. The negative correlations between happiness and PSS (r = -0.19) and self-esteem and PSS (r = -0.15) further support this interpretation, suggesting that higher levels of happiness and self-esteem are associated with lower stress. Although the participant experiences disturbed sleep and late sleep onset, these issues may be a consequence rather than a primary driver of high stress, especially given the overall positive psychological self-assessment. The elevated heart rate during late evening hours, while indicative of physiological arousal, does not necessarily translate to high perceived stress when considered alongside the subjective reports of low anxiety and high happiness. The absence of substance use and moderate engagement in social activities also contribute to a profile that is less indicative of high stress.

95374,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may inform their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicate a heightened burden of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CES-D score with a Z-score of 1.53, placing them in the ""Depressed"" classification. This is further corroborated by a STAI-Trait score of 47.0 (Z-score = 0.56), suggesting a propensity towards higher chronic anxiety. Notably, self-reported happiness is low, with a score of 2.0 (Z-score = -1.61). While Rosenberg Self-Esteem is moderately high (Score = 45.0, Z-score = 0.96), its negative correlation with PSS suggests that higher self-esteem might be associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also compromised, with a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score = 1.05) indicating disturbed sleep patterns. This is further supported by wearable data showing a significantly high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score = 2.68) and a considerable standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score = 1.43), suggesting irregularity in sleep schedules.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate amounts of leisure activities that may be sedentary. They report spending 1-2 hours watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, and a substantial 3-4 hours socializing with friends. A notable finding is the high engagement in video games, with a time expenditure of 1-2 hours daily and a very high Z-score of 2.47, which is negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting this activity might buffer stress. Conversely, the participant reports no engagement in physical exercise, either alone or with others, or in sports, with exceptionally low Z-scores for these activities (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). This lack of physical activity, coupled with a potentially high time commitment to screen-based entertainment and social interaction, may contribute to physiological patterns associated with stress.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate data reveals a highly variable daily pattern. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a large amplitude (Z-score = 2.06), suggesting significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. This is further underscored by the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor. Particularly elevated deviations are observed during the evening and night hours, with the 7-8 PM hour showing the largest positive deviation (Z-score = 3.42) relative to the mesor, and significant positive deviations also occurring between 9-11 PM and 12-1 AM. Conversely, early morning hours (5-8 AM) show marked negative deviations, suggesting periods of relative rest or reduced physiological activity. The mesor itself is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.32) and the resting heart rate is lower than average (Z-score = -0.8), which might indicate a baseline state of lower cardiovascular demand. However, the high amplitude and specific evening/nighttime elevated heart rate deviations, in conjunction with disturbed sleep, point towards a physiological system that is not well-regulated and may be experiencing heightened arousal during times typically associated with relaxation. The Interdaily Stability of heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.42), but Intradaily Variability is also elevated (Z-score = 0.17), suggesting some regularity in the overall daily cycle but significant within-day fluctuations.

Considering the overall evidence, the participant exhibits several indicators consistent with elevated perceived stress. The high burden of depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with low self-reported happiness and disturbed sleep patterns, are significant psychological indicators. Behaviorally, the lack of engagement in physical exercise and the presence of sedentary habits, along with irregular sleep, contribute to a profile that is often associated with increased stress. Physiologically, the pronounced variability in heart rate, especially the significant elevations in the evening and night, alongside a high amplitude of the circadian rhythm, suggests that the body is experiencing considerable strain. While some protective factors like moderate social interaction and video gaming (which show negative correlations with PSS) may exist, they do not appear to fully mitigate the impact of the other identified stressors. The data collectively suggests that the participant is likely experiencing a high level of perceived stress.

71985,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant presents a complex profile with several noteworthy characteristics influencing their perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a general lack of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.07), a tendency towards average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.03), and a relatively high level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.59). Subjective health satisfaction is lower than the population average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2), despite a Body Mass Index of 27.41 which falls within the overweight category. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is significantly lower than the population average (Beer Z-score: -1.12, Wine or Liquor Z-score: -1.3). In terms of daily activities, this participant exhibits higher-than-average engagement in exercising alone (Exercised Alone Frequency Z-score: 1.07) and significant engagement in video games (Video Games Time Z-score: 2.47), suggesting a propensity towards solitary leisure activities.

Analysis of wearable data reveals distinct patterns in circadian rhythm and activity. The interdaily stability of the participant's activity rhythm is notably high (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 2.07), indicating a structured and regular daily schedule. This is further supported by a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 1.74), reinforcing the consistency of daily patterns. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the day, is below population average (Mesor Z-score: -1.04), and the resting heart rate is also lower than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.97), suggesting a generally lower physiological arousal baseline. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is elevated (Amplitude Z-score: 1.01), indicating a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate. Examining the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant periods of elevated heart rate, particularly in the afternoon and evening (e.g., 1-2pm Z-score: 1.88, 7-8pm Z-score: 1.50, 9-10pm Z-score: 1.21). These elevated periods, occurring during waking hours, may reflect responses to stress or demanding activities. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is close to the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.14), and the sleep start time is around midnight (Median Sleep Start Time: 00:21:27), with moderate variability. The PSQI score suggests good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -0.8).

The participant's overall perceived stress level, considering the available data, leans towards the higher end of the distribution. While certain psychological traits like self-esteem and trait anxiety are within or below average, and subjective sleep quality is good, several behavioral and physiological indicators suggest elevated stress. The strong interdaily stability and autocorrelation in activity patterns, coupled with a lower resting heart rate, might reflect a tendency to maintain a structured but potentially high-demand daily routine. The periods of elevated heart rate during the day and evening, deviating significantly from the mesor, are particularly indicative of physiological responses that could be linked to stress. Furthermore, the lower-than-average health satisfaction, despite no reported substance usage and regular exercise (albeit solitary), could suggest underlying health concerns or the impact of stress on perceived well-being. The high engagement in video games, exceeding typical population levels, might also represent a coping mechanism for stress. Considering the overall pattern, these factors collectively point towards a higher perceived stress burden that influences physiological responses and potentially health satisfaction.

43125,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This analysis synthesizes multimodal data from a university student population to interpret perceived stress levels. The participant exhibits elevated levels in several psychological and behavioral indicators that are often associated with heightened stress. Specifically, the participant reports significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 37.0, Z-score 2.47) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 53.0, Z-score 1.16). These scores position the participant substantially above the population average for both constructs, indicating a considerable burden of negative affect and anxiety proneness. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed, with a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), surpassing the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This subjective poor sleep quality is a critical factor, as it can exacerbate stress and negatively impact cognitive function and emotional regulation.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in substance usage at higher frequencies than the population average, particularly with beer (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.72) and recreational drugs (1-2 times a week, Z-score 5.44). While the correlation of substance usage with perceived stress is generally weak in this dataset, the high frequency of these behaviors may reflect a coping mechanism or an underlying distress. In terms of daily habits, the participant dedicates significant time to passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and playing video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 1.71), while actively engaging in exercise or sports is absent (""Not at all"" for all categories). This pattern suggests a lack of engagement in potentially stress-reducing activities and a preference for more sedentary leisure pursuits, which can contribute to reduced well-being.

Physiological data from the wearable devices reveal a more complex picture. The participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by heart rate variability metrics, shows some deviations from regularity. The mesor (average heart rate around the rhythm's midpoint) is elevated (78.48, Z-score 0.62), and the amplitude (variation around the mesor) is particularly high (14.99, Z-score 1.36), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate, potentially indicative of heightened physiological arousal. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (6:29 PM), which is relatively standard. However, the intradaily variability is lower than average (0.49, Z-score -0.39), while interdaily stability is slightly higher than average (0.44, Z-score 0.25), suggesting more consistency in the pattern of heart rate fluctuations from day to day, but perhaps a less optimal daily pattern. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate elevated heart rate during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am: 9.88, Z-score 1.67; 1-2 am: 3.02, Z-score 1.53), which is unusual and could reflect disrupted sleep or stress-induced hyperarousal that interferes with natural nocturnal heart rate deceleration. Conversely, there are significant dips in heart rate deviation during the late night/early morning (e.g., 3-4 am: -21.66, Z-score -0.84; 5-6 am: -26.07, Z-score -1.12), which might be related to deeper sleep stages, but the overall sleep duration is within a normative range (median 7 hours 28 minutes, Z-score 0.35). The median sleep start time is quite late (02:00:00), and its standard deviation is within the average range, indicating a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. However, the subjective poor sleep quality (PSQI) combined with these physiological patterns suggests that while the duration may be adequate, the restorative quality of sleep might be compromised, contributing to elevated perceived stress.

Considering the participant's data holistically, the evidence strongly suggests a PSS score falling within the top 50th percentile of the study population. This conclusion is primarily driven by the significant elevation in self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 2.47) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.16), both of which are strongly correlated with perceived stress. The participant also reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score 1.52), a common correlate of high stress. The behavioral patterns, characterized by high recreational drug usage and a lack of physical activity, alongside elevated passive leisure, further support a profile consistent with elevated stress. While some physiological metrics, such as elevated mesor and amplitude, and unusual heart rate patterns during sleep, suggest potential physiological dysregulation that can accompany stress, the psychological and subjective behavioral data are the most direct indicators. The combination of high negative affect, anxiety, poor sleep quality, and maladaptive coping behaviors points towards a significant level of perceived stress, placing this participant in the upper half of the distribution.

98117,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics. Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of 2.05) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of 1.16), both falling in the higher range of the study population. Concurrently, their self-esteem is relatively low (SelfEsteem Z-score of -0.87), and they report lower levels of happiness (Happy Z-score of -1.61) and health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -0.95). Trust in others is also notably low (Trust Z-score of -2.07).

Regarding behavioral habits, this individual reports no substance usage and minimal engagement in physical activity, with 'Exercised Alone', 'Exercised with Others', and 'Sports' all reported as 'Not at all' (with corresponding Z-scores indicating significantly less frequent participation than the population average). Daily recreation habits are characterized by substantial engagement in screen-based activities: 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' for 2-3 hours daily (Z-score of 1.91), 'Video Games' for approximately 31 minutes an hour (Z-score of 1.71), and 'Internet Usage' for over 4 hours daily (Z-score of 2.19). In contrast, social interaction with friends is minimal ('15 minutes or less', Z-score of -2.2), and reading is not a reported habit.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate stability, with an 'Interdaily Stability' Z-score of -0.08 and 'Intradaily Variability' Z-score of -1.73, suggesting a somewhat less variable day-to-day rhythm than the average. The 'Mesor' of 80.99 is above population average (Z-score of 0.96), indicating a higher average heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs around 6:27 PM. A notable finding is the significant deviation of heart rate from the mesor during the early morning hours (2 AM to 7 AM), with pronounced negative deviations, suggesting a period of suppressed cardiovascular activity during these times. This pattern contrasts with later in the day, where heart rate deviations become positive, particularly between 5 PM and 11 PM, indicating periods of increased cardiovascular arousal in the evening. The participant's resting heart rate is also above average (Z-score of 0.98).

Sleep statistics reveal a shorter than average median sleep duration (6 hours 37 minutes, Z-score of -0.71). More critically, there are extreme deviations in sleep patterns, indicated by very high Z-scores for 'Sleep Duration Standard Deviation' (3.02) and 'Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation' (4.33). This suggests substantial inconsistency in both the length and timing of sleep, contributing to a high PSQI score (8.0, Z-score of 0.59), which is classified as indicative of disturbed sleep.

The data suggests a pattern of elevated distress, characterized by high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and reduced happiness. This psychological profile is accompanied by sedentary lifestyle choices with a strong emphasis on screen-based entertainment and minimal social engagement. Physiological data points to a higher resting and average heart rate, alongside significant sleep irregularities in terms of duration and timing, which are correlated with disturbed sleep quality.

The participant's PSS score is likely to fall in the top 50% of the study population distribution, indicating a relatively high level of perceived stress. Several indicators support this conclusion. The elevated scores on the CES-D and STAI scales, signifying higher depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, are positively correlated with perceived stress and place this individual in the upper range of these psychological distress measures. Furthermore, the low self-esteem, low happiness, and poor health satisfaction scores are generally associated with higher perceived stress. The observed significant sleep disturbances, particularly the high variability in sleep duration and start times, coupled with a shorter median sleep duration, are strongly linked to increased stress. While there are no direct PSS scores provided, the confluence of these negative psychological states, unhealthy behavioral patterns (sedentary lifestyle, limited social interaction), and significant sleep disruption strongly suggests a heightened stress burden that would place this participant above the median for perceived stress within the study population.

24883,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant attention in the context of perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a generally low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.45), and a moderate level of chronic anxiety, as indicated by the STAI Trait score falling near the population mean (Z-score: 0.07). Notably, self-esteem appears to be relatively high, with a Z-score of 1.52 above the population average. Trust levels are below average (Z-score: -1.1), and self-reported happiness is also below the population mean (Z-score: -0.53). Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.7).

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor usage of 1-2 times a week), with Z-scores indicating this is above the population average for both categories. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as not at all. Physical activity levels are notably low, with infrequent exercise alone (1-2 times a month) and no reported exercise with others or participation in sports. Daily recreational habits include moderate amounts of TV/video watching and internet usage, with lower engagement in activities such as video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveal patterns in sleep and circadian rhythm. The participant's median sleep duration is approximately 6 hours and 53 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.38). Sleep onset appears to be irregular, with a median sleep start time around 3:00 AM and a standard deviation of 69 minutes for sleep start time, suggesting potential disruption in sleep timing. The overall regularity of the circadian rhythm, as indicated by Interdaily Stability, is below average (Z-score: -0.99), while Intradaily Variability is also notably low (Z-score: -1.31), suggesting a less dynamic daily pattern. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is below the population average (Z-score: -0.67), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also low (Z-score: -1.11), suggesting a relatively flat daily heart rate fluctuation.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a distinct pattern of deviation from the Mesor. There are significant positive deviations (indicating higher than average heart rate relative to the Mesor) during the late night and early morning hours (12 AM - 5 AM), with the highest Z-scores observed between 1 AM and 3 AM (Z-scores of 1.95, 2.36, and 2.82, respectively). Conversely, negative deviations (lower than average heart rate relative to the Mesor) are observed during the morning hours, particularly between 5 AM and 8 AM, with Z-scores as low as -20.52 at 7-8 AM. Heart rate begins to rise again in the late morning and afternoon, showing positive deviations, and remains generally above the Mesor in the evening, with notable peaks between 10-11 PM and 11 PM - 12 AM. This pattern suggests a potential misalignment between sleep-wake cycles and physiological arousal.

Correlational analyses provide additional context. While not overriding the holistic interpretation, the moderate positive correlations between STAI-Trait and PSS (0.31), and CES-D and PSS (0.28) suggest that higher levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress. Lower self-esteem is weakly correlated with higher perceived stress (-0.16). Lower trust also shows a very weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.04). Physical activity, particularly participation in sports, shows a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.13), implying that more engagement might be associated with lower stress. Interestingly, several sleep-related metrics, such as sleep duration standard deviation (0.14) and sleep start time standard deviation (0.17), show weak positive correlations with PSS, suggesting that variability in sleep patterns might be linked to higher perceived stress.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine whether the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we will consider the provided Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population statistics. The population mean PSS score is 21.61, with a median of 22.0. The 75th percentile is 24.0, indicating that scores above 24 are in the top quartile, and scores above 22 are in the upper half of the distribution.

The participant's psychological profile presents a mixed picture. While self-esteem is notably high (Z-score: 1.52), indicating a potential buffer against stress, the participant exhibits below-average happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and below-average trust (Z-score: -1.1). Trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.07) is around the population average, and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.45) are below average, suggesting these are not primary drivers of elevated stress in this individual.

Behaviorally, low engagement in physical activity, particularly exercising with others and sports, is observed. Moderate alcohol consumption is also noted. These lifestyle factors could contribute to elevated stress.

The wearable data reveals significant disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythm regularity. The below-average median sleep duration and the highly variable sleep start times, coupled with low Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability, suggest a lack of structured rest and a disrupted daily rhythm. The pattern of elevated heart rate deviations during the late night and early morning, followed by significant drops in the morning, indicates a potential physiological dysregulation that can be associated with stress.

Considering the population's PSS distribution, where a score of 22.0 or higher falls into the top 50% (bottom_50 includes the median, top_50 is above the median), the participant's profile points towards an elevated stress level. The disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms, along with the below-average happiness and trust, and limited physical activity, are strong indicators that could contribute to a higher perceived stress score. Although self-esteem is high, it may not fully mitigate the impact of these other factors. Without the participant's actual PSS score, we infer their likely placement based on the convergence of evidence. The physiological markers of disturbed sleep and circadian rhythm, combined with behavioral patterns that are not typically stress-buffering, suggest that their PSS score is likely to be in the higher range of the distribution.

66815,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a pattern of generally positive psychological and behavioral traits. Their self-reported anxiety levels (STAI) are within the classification of ""anxious"" but with a Z-score very close to zero, suggesting this is not a pronounced trait relative to the study population. Similarly, their depressive symptomology (CESD) is classified as ""Not depressed"" with a slightly negative Z-score, indicating a lower burden than average. Self-esteem is above average, as indicated by a positive Z-score. Importantly, their subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a significantly negative Z-score, suggesting a better than average subjective sleep experience. High trust levels and a high self-reported happiness score further contribute to a positive psychological profile. Lifestyle behaviors are characterized by a lack of substance use and limited engagement in solitary recreational activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or prolonged internet/music listening. Exercise is predominantly undertaken with others, a behavior associated with more frequent engagement than the average participant.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a relatively low mesor (mean heart rate around which daily rhythms oscillate) and a low resting heart rate, both with negative Z-scores, suggesting a physiologically calm baseline. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is notably high, with a positive Z-score, indicating a larger fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. This is further supported by the pattern of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor. While the early morning hours (3-8 AM) show significant negative deviations, indicative of low heart rates during sleep, the late afternoon and evening hours (5-10 PM) exhibit pronounced positive deviations, with particularly strong peaks around 5-6 PM and 9-10 PM. This pattern suggests periods of heightened physiological arousal or activity in the late afternoon and evening. Their sleep duration is close to the population average, with a slightly negative Z-score indicating a modest tendency towards shorter sleep. However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is low, suggesting consistent sleep timing. The standard deviation of sleep start time is also relatively low, indicating a degree of regularity in sleep onset.

The participant's sleep regularity, as indicated by the interdaily stability of their heart rate, is slightly above average. However, their intradaily variability is also slightly above average, suggesting a more dynamic heart rate pattern throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is lower than average, which could imply a less consistent daily rhythm in heart rate compared to the population norm. Despite the pronounced evening heart rate elevations, the overall sleep quality is subjectively reported as good, and the mesor and resting heart rate are low. The high amplitude and late evening heart rate peaks, in conjunction with a lower than average autocorrelation, might indicate a more pronounced difference between periods of rest and activity or arousal within the daily cycle, without necessarily impacting subjective sleep quality negatively.

Considering the participant's data in relation to the population's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) distribution, several factors suggest a PSS score in the bottom 50th percentile. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = -0.24) and high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = 0.54). They also report high happiness (Happy Z-score = 1.64) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = -0.8), all of which are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, their low resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.47) and mesor (Z-score = -1.32) indicate a physiologically calmer state, which is often inversely related to stress levels. While there are notable elevations in heart rate during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 5-6 PM and 9-10 PM), these are within the context of generally low physiological arousal metrics and good subjective sleep. The moderate anxiety score (STAI Z-score = -0.03) is not significantly elevated. The positive correlations between these indicators (e.g., CESD, Happy, Resting Heart Rate, PSQI) and PSS are generally in the expected direction for lower stress levels. Specifically, the negative correlation of higher happiness, better sleep quality, and lower resting heart rate with PSS scores would support placement in the bottom half of the distribution.

Given the consistent pattern of positive psychological indicators, good subjective sleep, and a generally lower physiological baseline (apart from evening heart rate elevations), the evidence points towards the participant experiencing relatively low to average perceived stress.

89161,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant presents a complex profile, with several metrics suggesting a generally positive psychological and behavioral state, contrasted with some indicators that warrant further attention, particularly in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02), classifying the participant as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 49.0, representing a Z-score of 1.52, indicating a significantly higher self-worth compared to the study population. Similarly, self-reported happiness is also elevated, with a Z-score of 1.64. Health satisfaction is also high (Z-score 1.38), suggesting a favorable outlook on their physical well-being. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 5.0 and a Z-score of -0.8, falling within a range that does not typically indicate significant disturbance.

Behavioral patterns reveal a moderate engagement with some activities and a higher-than-average engagement in others. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported as ""1-2 times a week,"" with recreational drug usage exhibiting a high Z-score of 5.44, suggesting this is a notable behavior for this participant relative to the population. Exercise frequency is moderate, with exercising alone occurring ""1-2 times a week,"" while exercising with others and sports participation are less frequent (""1-2 times a month"").

Physiological data from the wearable devices presents a more varied picture. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate regularity, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.39 (Z-score -0.16) and an Intradaily Variability of 0.73 (Z-score 1.3), suggesting a somewhat variable daily rhythm. The Mesor (mean heart rate during the day) is within the lower range for the population (Z-score -0.86), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also lower than average (Z-score -0.33). The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 5:38 PM. Resting heart rate is also on the lower side (Z-score -0.51). Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of elevated physiological arousal during the late morning and late evening, specifically between 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.65) and 11-12 AM (Z-score 1.29). There are also notable deviations during the midday period, particularly from 12 PM to 1 PM (Z-score 1.1). Conversely, there are periods of significant suppression of heart rate deviation during the early morning hours, notably between 3-4 AM (Z-score -0.13) and 4-5 AM (Z-score 0.11). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of ""7 hours 26 minutes"" (Z-score 0.32), which is slightly above the population average, and a relatively consistent sleep start time (standard deviation of 47 minutes, Z-score -0.79), suggesting some stability in sleep timing.

Overall, the participant exhibits strong indicators of positive psychological well-being, including low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, and good subjective sleep quality. However, their behavioral patterns indicate a high frequency of recreational drug use and a significant amount of time spent on passive activities like listening to music and internet usage. Physiologically, while resting heart rate and Mesor are low, there are notable periods of elevated heart rate deviation during late evening and midday. The correlation data offers additional context: lower self-esteem and higher stress correlate negatively with PSS, while higher anxiety and depression correlate positively. The observed data points do not strongly align with either extreme of the PSS distribution without a direct PSS score. Given the high self-esteem and low anxiety/depression, it might lean towards the lower end. However, the significant recreational drug use and elevated late-night heart rate deviations are potential stressors. Without a direct PSS score for this participant, it is challenging to definitively place them in the top or bottom 50%. However, considering the strong positive self-report measures for mental well-being, and the generally normative sleep duration, the evidence leans towards the lower half of the PSS distribution, though the high recreational drug usage and certain physiological patterns could contribute to moderate stress.

14847,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant a multimodal analysis in relation to their perceived stress levels, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Self-reported data indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and chronic anxiety proneness (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86). Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 35.0, Z-Score -0.45) and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy score of 4.0, Z-Score 0.55). The participant also reports significant subjective sleep disturbance, as indicated by a high PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-Score 1.52), which is indicative of poor sleep quality. Notably, the participant reports very low trust of others (Trust score of 1.67, Z-Score -3.03). In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with recreational drugs being less frequent than the population average (Z-Score 1.61, but this likely reflects the categorical nature of the data). They exercise alone three times a week or more, but do not exercise with others or participate in sports. Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, and socializing with friends, with less time spent on video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies.

Wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics provide further insights into the participant's daily functioning. The participant demonstrates a higher than average intraday variability in heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-Score 2.01), suggesting a potentially more reactive cardiovascular system or more disrupted daily routines. This is contrasted by a lower than average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-Score -0.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-Score -0.78), indicating less regularity in their daily circadian rhythm of heart rate. The participant's resting heart rate is within the population average (Resting Heart Rate Z-Score 0.03). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals notable patterns. There are pronounced deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am, 4-5 am, 5-6 am, 6-7 am, 7-8 am), with particularly significant negative deviations occurring between 5-6 am and 6-7 am. Conversely, positive deviations are observed during the afternoon and evening (e.g., 12-1 pm, 1-2 pm, 4-5 pm, 5-6 pm, 6-7 pm, 7-8 pm, 8-9 pm, 9-10 pm, 10-11 pm), peaking between 7-8 pm. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-Score -0.69), and a median sleep start time of 2:24 AM, which is also later than typical. The participant also takes more naps than average (Mean Daily Naps Z-Score 1.9).

Considering the available data, the participant's self-reported psychological state, particularly the elevated scores on the CES-D and STAI scales, alongside significant subjective sleep disturbance, suggests a potential for higher perceived stress. The negative correlation coefficients between these measures and the PSS score, while not overwhelmingly strong, do suggest a tendency for higher levels of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep to co-occur with higher perceived stress. The participant's atypical heart rate variability patterns, specifically the high intraday variability and lower interdaily stability, coupled with a shorter sleep duration and later sleep onset, may further contribute to a perception of being overwhelmed or stressed. While some self-report measures like self-esteem and happiness are not indicative of high stress, the constellation of other factors points towards an increased likelihood of experiencing elevated stress.

The participant's psychological and physiological data suggest a profile consistent with elevated perceived stress. The significant scores on the CES-D (depressive symptoms) and STAI (anxiety proneness) scales, alongside the PSQI indicating disturbed sleep, are all indicators that tend to correlate with higher perceived stress levels. While the correlation coefficients are not exceptionally high across the board, the presence of these elevated scores in conjunction with a shorter than average sleep duration and later sleep start time, alongside increased napping behavior, indicates a potential strain on the participant's resources. The observed intraday variability in heart rate suggests a potentially dysregulated physiological response to daily demands, which can be a marker of stress. Therefore, considering the convergence of these indicators, it is most probable that this participant falls into the top 50% of the study population in terms of perceived stress.

43382,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and physiological indicators. Notably, elevated scores on the CES-D (Z-score 1.53) and STAI (Z-score 0.46) suggest a significant burden of depressive and anxious symptoms, respectively. These findings are corroborated by a notably low self-reported happiness score (Z-score 1.64). Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range (Z-score -0.87), and trust levels are also slightly below average (Z-score -0.46). Health satisfaction, however, is reported as above average (Z-score 1.22).

Behavioral patterns indicate minimal engagement in typical stress-mitigating activities. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, is reported at very low frequencies or not at all, aligning with low Z-scores for these metrics. Similarly, exercise, whether alone, with others, or sports, is reported as ""Not at all,"" reflected in substantially negative Z-scores, particularly for exercising alone (Z-score -1.93). Daily recreation habits are varied but generally not time-intensive, with the exception of watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.01) and listening to music (Z-score -0.26). Notably, internet usage is reported as very low (Z-score -1.83), while reading and socializing with friends are also not significant time expenditures.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a somewhat elevated Mesor (mean heart rate) (Z-score 1.27), suggesting a higher baseline cardiovascular activity. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and lower than average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.74), which might suggest a more regulated but potentially less dynamic daily heart rate pattern. The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:54 PM). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal notable patterns. There are significant negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am, -19.26), suggesting periods of lower physiological arousal during sleep. Conversely, positive deviations are observed in the late morning and evening hours (e.g., 9-10 pm, 11.45; 10-11 pm, 10.63), potentially reflecting increased cardiovascular activity during wakeful periods.

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes, which is below average (Z-score -1.27), and a relatively consistent sleep start time (SD 101 minutes). Napping frequency is minimal. The standard deviations for sleep duration and sleep start time are within typical ranges.

The correlation between CES-D score and PSS is positive (0.29), and the correlation between STAI score and PSS is also positive (0.32), indicating that higher levels of depression and anxiety are associated with higher perceived stress. Low happiness is also weakly associated with higher PSS ( -0.19, indicating higher happiness is associated with lower PSS). Reading, a potentially stress-reducing activity, shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), suggesting more reading is associated with lower perceived stress.

The participant's elevated CES-D and STAI scores, coupled with low self-reported happiness, are strong indicators of psychological distress that would likely contribute to a higher perceived stress level. While some physiological and behavioral metrics, such as health satisfaction and low substance use, might suggest protective factors, the pronounced symptoms of depression and anxiety, along with limited engagement in stress-mitigating behaviors like exercise and sufficient sleep, point towards an overall higher perceived stress burden.

Given the participant's significantly elevated scores in depressive and anxiety symptoms, alongside a below-average sleep duration and a lack of engagement in physical activity or other stress-reducing behaviors, it is highly probable that their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score falls within the top 50th percentile of the study population. The positive correlations between depression and anxiety symptoms and PSS further support this conclusion. While self-esteem and trust are not particularly low, and health satisfaction is high, these factors are unlikely to fully counteract the impact of the pronounced psychological distress and behavioral patterns observed.

75438,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a self-reported psychological profile characterized by lower-than-average levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.66), anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -0.52), and a notably high level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.73). This suggests a generally positive psychological disposition. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is also below the population mean (Z-score: -0.53), which is an interesting contrast to the high self-esteem. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score: -0.33), falling into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, though not drastically divergent from the population. Trust levels are significantly lower than the average participant (Trust Z-score: -1.1).

Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption, drinking wine or liquor ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.94), which is above the population average, while beer consumption is less frequent (""1-2 times a month,"" Z-score: 0.3). Substance usage for recreational drugs and non-prescribed drugs is reported as very low. In terms of physical activity, the participant exercises alone ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.07), indicating a strong tendency towards solitary exercise, and engages in sports and exercising with others less frequently. Daily sedentary recreational habits include moderate internet usage (Z-score: -0.49) and listening to music for 1-2 hours (Z-score: 0.67), while activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, and reading are not engaged in. Socializing with friends is reported as occupying 2-3 hours (Z-score: 0.95), suggesting a significant allocation of time to social interactions.

Analysis of wearable-derived metrics reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm structure. Interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.66) suggests a moderate degree of regularity in daily patterns, while intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.09) indicates less fluctuation within the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 0.31) suggests some consistency in daily cycles. The participant's Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is below the population mean (Z-score: -0.61), and their resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score: -0.61). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.08). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the mid-afternoon at 3:28 PM.

Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor provides insight into daily physiological arousal patterns. The participant shows a pattern of reduced heart rate deviation during the early morning hours, with the most pronounced negative deviations observed between 3-5 AM (Z-scores: -0.73 to -0.51). Heart rate deviation becomes increasingly positive from late morning through the afternoon, peaking between 12 PM and 3 PM, with the highest positive deviations observed between 2-3 PM (Z-score: 2.07). This suggests a period of higher physiological arousal during the midday and early afternoon. Deviations then decrease in the evening and nighttime hours, becoming slightly positive before returning to near baseline or slightly negative levels overnight.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 2 minutes, which is significantly shorter than the population average (Z-score: -1.43). The standard deviation of sleep duration is close to the mean (Z-score: -0.15). The median sleep start time is late, at 1:43 AM, with a moderate standard deviation for sleep start times (Z-score: -0.38). There are no recorded naps, suggesting a consolidated sleep period.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported psychological profile is generally positive, with low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem. However, subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed, and trust levels are lower than average. While these factors can influence perceived stress, they do not directly indicate high stress in this participant's case.

The wearable data reveals a relatively consistent circadian rhythm, though with a shorter than average sleep duration. The physiological data indicates a clear diurnal pattern of heart rate deviation, with higher arousal during the afternoon, which is typical. The correlations provided in the data offer some hints: for example, a higher PSS score is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.28) and STAI (0.31), suggesting that higher stress might be associated with more depressive symptoms and anxiety. The correlation between PSS and Self-Esteem is weakly negative (-0.16), implying higher stress might be associated with lower self-esteem, though this participant's self-esteem is already high.

Given the participant's relatively low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem, the available evidence leans towards a lower perceived stress level. While disturbed sleep and lower trust could contribute to stress, they are not definitive indicators of a high PSS score in isolation. The PSS population distribution has a 50th percentile of 22.0. Without a direct PSS score, we infer based on the convergent evidence of positive psychological traits. The strong self-esteem, low anxiety, and low depressive symptoms suggest that the participant likely falls within the lower half of the PSS distribution.

99733,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a generally healthy psychological profile with low self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, as indicated by their CES-D score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.86) and STAI-Trait score of 31.0 (Z-score: -1.02), respectively. Self-esteem is also within a healthy range, with a score of 33.0 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z-score: -0.73), suggesting a positive self-perception. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as good with a score of 4.0 (Z-score: -1.26), aligning with the classification of ""Good Sleep."" Trust levels are slightly above average with a score of 3.33 (Z-score: 0.18), and self-reported happiness is also slightly below average with a score of 3.0 (Z-score: -0.53). Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Score: 5.0, Z-score: 0.55).

Behavioral habits suggest limited engagement in substance use, with reported ""Not at all"" usage for beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, all of which have low Z-scores. Exercise habits are mixed; the participant exercises alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32), but exercises with others and participates in sports less than 1-2 times a month, with corresponding Z-scores of -0.88 and -0.42, respectively. Daily recreational habits indicate moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.62), and a low engagement in video games (Do not do, Z-score: -0.56), listening to music (Do not do, Z-score: -1.19), and socializing with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.41). There is a notable engagement in reading (15 minutes or less, Z-score: 0.32) and sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.36).

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate stability. Interdaily stability (IS) of heart rate is 0.39 (Z-score: -0.16), suggesting some regularity in daily activity patterns, while intradaily variability (IV) is 0.7 (Z-score: 1.09), indicating a moderate level of activity fluctuation throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is 0.26 (Z-score: -0.53), suggesting a mild tendency for daily patterns to repeat. The mesor of 74.93 (Z-score: 0.13) represents the average heart rate, and the amplitude of 9.44 (Z-score: -0.43) suggests a moderate variation around this mesor. The acrophase is recorded at 3:08 PM. Resting heart rate is 62.6 bpm (Z-score: 0.53), which is slightly higher than the population average.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. The participant exhibits a lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1 AM to 6 AM, with deviations ranging from -16.76 to -9.26). Heart rate then increases throughout the morning, with positive deviations appearing around 8-9 AM and peaking in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM to 2 PM, with deviations up to 15.5). Heart rate decreases in the late afternoon and evening, with negative deviations observed from 9 PM onwards. The strongest positive deviations, indicative of heightened physiological arousal, occur between 11 AM and 2 PM, aligning with typical daytime activity. The strongest negative deviations, suggesting periods of lower physiological activity, are observed in the early morning hours. The positive correlation between intradaily variability and PSS score (0.16) might suggest that greater fluctuation in daily activity could be associated with higher stress, however, this effect is modest. Several heart rate deviation metrics show a moderate positive correlation with PSS, particularly during the late morning and early afternoon hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM, 8-9 AM, showing correlations between 0.11 and 0.22). This suggests that periods of elevated heart rate during these times may be associated with increased perceived stress.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes (Z-score: -0.58), which is slightly below the average for the study population. The standard deviation of sleep duration is 86 minutes (Z-score: -0.33), suggesting relatively consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is 00:38:21, with a standard deviation of 65 minutes (Z-score: -0.39), indicating moderate variability in sleep onset. The participant also takes naps, with a mean of 0.09 naps per day (Z-score: 0.21). The moderate negative correlation between median sleep duration and PSS score (-0.05) suggests that shorter sleep durations are marginally associated with higher perceived stress.

Overall, the participant presents with a generally low symptom burden across psychological measures and engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors, with the exception of limited social exercise. Their physiological data indicates moderate circadian rhythmicity and daily patterns of heart rate variation. While some specific heart rate deviations during waking hours show a modest positive correlation with perceived stress, the overall profile does not strongly suggest elevated stress. The participant's sleep duration is slightly below average but not drastically so, and their subjective sleep quality is good.

Considering the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population. This assessment is based on the consistently low scores on self-report measures of depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), as well as good subjective sleep quality (PSQI). While there are some moderate positive correlations between specific hourly heart rate deviations and the PSS score, these are not overwhelmingly strong and do not indicate a pervasive pattern of physiological stress. Furthermore, the participant's engagement in substance use is minimal, and their self-esteem and happiness levels are within a reasonable range. The slightly below-average sleep duration is a factor, but is counterbalanced by the good reported sleep quality and the modest correlation with PSS. Therefore, the evidence leans towards an average or lower-than-average perceived stress level.

27407,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits a mixed profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several indicators suggesting potential areas of concern relevant to perceived stress. Self-report measures reveal elevated trait anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86), classifying the participant as anxious. While depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 13.0, Z-score -0.03) are within the ""Not depressed"" range, the co-occurrence of high trait anxiety may contribute to overall psychological strain. Self-esteem is slightly below average (SelfEsteem score of 36.0, Z-score -0.31), and happiness is moderately above average (Happy Z-score 0.55), suggesting a potentially complex interplay between internal states. Health satisfaction is reported as relatively low (Health Satisfaction score of 3.56, Z-score -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance usage, with beer consumed 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.3). Exercise habits are consistent with moderate engagement, with exercising alone, with others, and participation in sports all occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits indicate limited engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.62) and video games (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.2), with moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18). Notably, activities such as reading (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32) and socializing with friends (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score -0.62) are also relatively limited in duration.

Physiological data from wearable devices present further insights. The participant exhibits a significantly lower than average Mesor (Value 65.18, Z-score -1.2) and Resting Heart Rate (Value 46.3, Z-score -1.41), suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. However, the average daily deviations from the Mesor indicate periods of elevated heart rate, particularly during the evening hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: 21.96, Z-score 1.82; 8-9 PM: 22.38, Z-score 2.25; 9-10 PM: 16.22, Z-score 1.43). These late-evening elevations in heart rate, coupled with a high PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) indicating ""Disturbed Sleep,"" suggest potential difficulties in transitioning to rest and recovery. Sleep duration is also on the shorter side, with a median of 6 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score -1.17). The data on circadian rhythm metrics, such as a lower than average Interdaily Stability (Value 0.4, Z-score -0.08), may further indicate a less regular daily pattern, which can be associated with heightened stress.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely in the bottom 50th percentile. While the participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety and disturbed sleep, which are often correlated with higher stress, several factors suggest a median or lower-than-median stress level. Their academic performance (GPA) is consistently high, indicating effective functioning in a demanding environment. Self-reported depressive symptoms are not elevated. Furthermore, their resting heart rate and Mesor are considerably lower than the population average, which might reflect a baseline physiological state that buffers against extremely high stress responses. Although evening heart rate elevations and poor sleep quality are noted, they do not in isolation strongly indicate a PSS score in the top 50%. The correlations provided, while not definitive, generally show weak associations between these variables and PSS, with some even being negative. This suggests that while there are areas of concern, they may not translate to an overwhelmingly high perceived stress burden relative to the study population.

43794,26.0,0.927461139896373,"This analysis focuses on the psychological and behavioral correlates of perceived stress, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), within a university student population. The participant exhibits a pattern of elevated anxiety, as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), with a Z-score of 1.35, suggesting a disposition towards higher chronic anxiety levels compared to the study cohort. This is accompanied by a lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score of -0.87) and a tendency towards lower happiness (Z-score of -0.53). While depressive symptoms, assessed by the CES-D scale, are within the non-depressed range (Z-score of -0.34), the confluence of anxiety and lower self-esteem may contribute to heightened perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant reports engaging in moderate weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score of 0.94), while beer consumption is infrequent. Notably, there is a significant disparity in daily recreation habits. While activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage are reported at lower than average durations, the participant dedicates an exceptionally high amount of time to listening to music (Z-score of 2.06), indicating a strong preference for auditory engagement. Conversely, reading and sedentary hobbies are virtually absent. Socializing with friends is also reported at a lower than average duration (Z-score of -0.62). The participant's academic performance, reflected in their GPA, has shown a decline between Fall 2015 and Fall 2016. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (Z-score of 0.59), suggesting difficulties in achieving restorative sleep.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal a less regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by a low interdaily stability (Z-score of -1.73) and a moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.03). The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.41) relative to the population, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably low (Z-score of -1.76), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate cycle, occurs in the late afternoon (5:00 PM). The participant's resting heart rate is elevated, with a Z-score of 1.5, indicating a higher baseline cardiovascular tone. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significantly lower than average heart rate deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z-score 1.35, 4-5 AM: Z-score 1.58, 5-6 AM: Z-score 1.28, 6-7 AM: Z-score 0.74), suggesting a physiological state that is not aligned with typical diurnal patterns and may reflect poor sleep or internal dysregulation during these periods. Conversely, the participant exhibits higher than average heart rate deviations during the late evening hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: Z-score -0.51, 8-9 PM: Z-score -0.77, 9-10 PM: Z-score -1.02). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration that is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.24), with a greater variability in sleep duration and start times (Z-scores of 1.25 and 0.86, respectively). The absence of daily naps is also noted.

Considering the elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem and happiness, disturbed sleep, and the physiological indicators of a less regulated circadian rhythm with higher resting heart rate, alongside a decline in academic performance, there is substantial evidence to suggest that this participant experiences a relatively high level of perceived stress. The PSS population mean is 21.6, with a median of 22.0. Given the convergence of negative psychological indicators and physiological irregularities, it is plausible that this participant falls within the upper half of the PSS distribution.

This participant exhibits a complex profile of behaviors and physiological patterns. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a relatively low level of chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.62) and no significant depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.97). However, self-esteem is notably higher than the population average (Self-Esteem Z-score of 0.96), suggesting a generally positive self-perception. Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 0.3). Regarding lifestyle habits, this individual reports moderate substance usage (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a month), no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and engages in regular exercise, particularly sports and exercising alone (Exercised Alone Z-score of 1.07, Sports Z-score of 1.58). Daily recreational habits include moderate television/video/movie watching and internet usage, but minimal engagement in video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, or other sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals several noteworthy physiological characteristics. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated compared to the study population (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 1.77). Their circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.82), suggesting less consistency in daily routines, and a high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score of 1.51), which could reflect periods of significant physiological fluctuation throughout the day. The Mesor, representing the central tendency of heart rate, is higher than average (Mesor Z-score of 1.29), while the amplitude, indicating the extent of daily heart rate variation, is lower than average (Amplitude Z-score of -1.59). This combination suggests a higher baseline heart rate with less pronounced diurnal swings. Hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the Mesor, particularly in the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM deviation of 25.6, Z-score 3.91; 1-2 AM deviation of 6.63, Z-score 2.04; 4-5 AM deviation of -10.88, Z-score 1.2), indicating periods of higher than typical cardiovascular activity during these times, which may be linked to sleep patterns or awakenings.

Sleep statistics highlight a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -1.16). The median sleep start time is very late (02:14:30), with a standard deviation indicating relatively consistent sleep timing (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of -1.12). The PSQI score suggests disturbed sleep quality, falling above the threshold for significant sleep disturbance. Despite the objectively shorter sleep duration and reported disturbed quality, the participant's self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score of -0.53), and there is a moderate negative correlation between reading habits and PSS scores (Score Correlation of -0.21), and self-reported happiness and PSS scores (Score Correlation of -0.19).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score ranking, we must holistically assess the available data in relation to the population PSS distribution (Mean 21.62, 50th percentile 22.0).

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes relatively low levels of reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.97) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62). Furthermore, self-esteem is high (Self-Esteem Z-score 0.96), and health satisfaction is above average. While sleep duration is shorter than average and reported as disturbed (PSQI score of 6.0), these factors do not directly correlate strongly with PSS in this individual's data, apart from a weak negative correlation with reading and happiness, which are associated with lower PSS.

Conversely, several indicators suggest a potential for elevated stress (top 50th percentile). The participant's resting heart rate is notably high (Resting Heart Rate Z-score 1.77), and their circadian rhythm exhibits high intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score 1.51), indicating physiological dysregulation. The elevated Mesor (Mesor Z-score 1.29) and significant deviations in hourly heart rate from the Mesor, particularly during the night and early morning, suggest a physiologically stressed state. The shorter sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score -1.16) and diagnosed disturbed sleep quality (PSQI classification) are commonly associated with higher stress levels. While not explicitly measured, the late sleep start time could also contribute to a sense of being out of sync. The positive correlation between Intradaily Variability and PSS (0.16) further supports this.

Holistically, the physiological indicators of elevated heart rate, disrupted circadian regularity, and poor sleep quality, despite generally positive self-reported mental health traits, suggest that this participant likely experiences a degree of physiological stress that would place them in the upper half of the perceived stress distribution. The significant deviations in hourly heart rate, coupled with a higher resting heart rate and compromised sleep, point towards a sustained state of physiological activation that is often associated with higher perceived stress.

21932,13.0,0.023316062176165803,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data to understand perceived stress in a university student population. The participant exhibits generally favorable psychological self-reports, with low scores on the CES-D (4.0, indicating not depressed) and STAI-Trait (28.0, indicating not anxious). Self-esteem is notably high (50.0, with a Z-score of 1.66), suggesting a robust sense of self-worth. Trust levels are near average (3.0, Z-score -0.46), and self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (3.0, Z-score -0.53). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is indicated as disturbed (8.0, Z-score 0.59), which is a potential area of concern despite other positive self-assessments. Academic performance is strong, with GPAs consistently at or near 4.0. Health satisfaction is moderately positive (5.0, Z-score 0.55).

Behavioral patterns reveal moderate substance use, with beer consumption less than monthly and wine/liquor used 1-2 times per month. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise habits include engaging in solitary and group exercise 1-2 times per week, with sports participation 1-2 times per month. Daily recreational activities are minimal, with no reported time spent watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is limited to 1-2 hours daily, and socializing with friends occurs for about 31 minutes per hour. Reading is also reported as not done. These activity patterns suggest a potentially structured, albeit somewhat limited, daily routine.

Wearable data provides insights into physiological rhythms and activity. The participant exhibits good circadian rhythm stability (Interdaily Stability: 0.49, Z-score 0.67) but high variability within the day (Intradaily Variability: 0.68, Z-score 0.95), suggesting a less consistent daily pattern of physiological activity. The Mesor (69.72, Z-score -0.58) is below the population average, indicating a lower overall daily average heart rate. The acrophase of 5:20 PM suggests a late afternoon peak in heart rate activity. Resting heart rate is also below the population average (54.1, Z-score -0.48). The deviation from the mesor analysis reveals pronounced periods of elevated heart rate, particularly between 12 PM - 2 PM (Z-scores 2.59 and 2.11) and 10 PM - 11 PM (Z-score 3.14), and a significant dip during the early morning hours (e.g., 4 AM - 5 AM, Z-score -0.89). These patterns may indicate physiological responses to daily stressors or activity timing. Sleep duration is longer than average (Median Sleep Duration: 8 hours 14 minutes, Z-score 1.31), but the variability in sleep duration is moderate (50 minutes, Z-score -1.15). Sleep start time is consistent on average (Median Sleep Start Time: 00:37:45), with moderate variability (55 minutes, Z-score -0.61).

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported psychological profile is largely positive, with low levels of depressive and anxious symptoms and high self-esteem. These factors generally correlate with lower perceived stress. However, the PSQI score of 8.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and a positive Z-score of 0.59, suggest a notable concern with sleep quality, which is often associated with elevated stress. The wearable data reveals some concerning physiological patterns, including high intradaily variability in heart rate, significant peaks in heart rate deviation from the mesor during midday and late evening, and a considerable dip in heart rate during the early morning. While the participant's resting heart rate and Mesor are below average, the pronounced hourly deviations, particularly the late-night spike (10 PM - 11 PM), could indicate physiological arousal and stress responses during or leading up to bedtime. The correlation between PSS scores and several metrics, though generally weak, show some trends: positive correlations with Intradaily Variability (0.17) and certain deep sleep hours deviations (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), and negative correlations with self-esteem (-0.14) and happiness (-0.20).

Considering the population PSS mean of 21.64 and median of 22.0, and the participant's generally positive self-reports and strong academic performance, it is plausible they do not experience extremely high stress. However, the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, coupled with the observed physiological arousal patterns in wearable data (particularly the late-night heart rate elevation), suggests that stress may be present and impacting sleep. The correlation analysis, while not overwhelmingly strong, shows a slight tendency for higher stress to be associated with greater physiological variability and poorer sleep quality, as well as lower self-esteem and happiness. Given these combined factors, the participant likely falls within the average range of perceived stress, rather than the extremely high end. Therefore, a placement in the bottom 50% of the distribution, encompassing average to lower stress levels, seems most appropriate.

36385,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a notable elevation in psychological distress as indicated by their self-reported survey data. The CES-D score of 29.0, with a Z-score of 1.63, suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms, placing them well above the population average. This finding is corroborated by a STAI-Trait score of 49.0 (Z-score = 0.76), indicating a proneness to chronic anxiety. While self-esteem is not markedly low (RSES score of 31.0, Z-score = -1.01), the co-occurrence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety suggests a complex psychological profile. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Score = 6.0, Z-score = -0.33), aligning with the potential impact of stress on sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor usage occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.94), which is higher than the population average. This is contrasted by lower than average usage of beer (Z-score = 0.3) and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits indicate a significant amount of time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13), which may serve as a coping mechanism or leisure activity. Conversely, the participant reports not engaging in reading or video games. Exercise frequency is mixed, with solitary exercise occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.32) and sports participation at a similar frequency (Z-score = 0.91), while exercising with others is less frequent.

From a physiological perspective, the wearable data reveals a higher than average resting heart rate (Value = 64.05, Z-score = 0.7). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows distinct patterns of deviation from the mesor. Notably, there are periods of increased cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 7-8 PM (deviation = 16.91, Z-score = 0.94) and 9-10 PM (deviation = 12.74, Z-score = 0.82). This suggests that these times of day might be associated with heightened physiological arousal, potentially linked to daily stressors or activities. Conversely, during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), heart rate deviations are more negative, indicating lower activity, which is typical for sleep periods. The circadian rhythm metrics suggest a reasonably stable rhythm with moderate interdaily stability (Value = 0.44, Z-score = 0.25) and intradaily variability (Value = 0.56, Z-score = 0.1), indicating some regularity in daily physiological patterns. However, the mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly elevated (Value = 76.96, Z-score = 0.41). Sleep statistics indicate exceptionally long sleep durations (Median = 8 hours 47 minutes, Z-score = 2.0), which might be compensatory or indicative of poor sleep efficiency despite the duration. The sleep start time variability is also notably high (Standard Deviation = 140 minutes, Z-score = 1.26), suggesting an irregular sleep schedule.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data suggests a profile indicative of elevated perceived stress, likely placing them in the top 50% of the study population. The most compelling evidence for high stress comes from the self-reported survey data. The CES-D score of 29.0, classified as ""Depressed,"" and the STAI-Trait score of 49.0, indicating ""anxious"" tendencies, are significantly above average (Z-scores of 1.63 and 0.76 respectively). These scores are positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms are associated with greater perceived stress. Furthermore, the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep quality, which is a common consequence and contributor to high stress levels.

While some indicators might suggest a more balanced picture, such as moderate self-esteem and not engaging in illicit substance use, the combined weight of psychological distress measures strongly points towards elevated stress. The exceptionally long sleep duration, while seemingly positive, coupled with high sleep start time variability, might indicate disrupted sleep architecture or difficulty achieving restful sleep, further supporting a high-stress state. The elevated resting heart rate also contributes to the overall picture of physiological strain. The correlations between these metrics and PSS, though not always strong, consistently lean towards an association with higher perceived stress.

Considering the robust indicators of psychological distress (depression and anxiety) and disturbed sleep, in conjunction with physiological markers of elevated arousal, it is highly probable that this participant experiences a level of perceived stress that falls within the top 50% of the study population.

54030,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators. Self-report measures reveal a low propensity for depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.07) and a classification of ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (Z-score of -1.41). Self-esteem appears to be relatively high, as indicated by a Z-score of 1.52 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Similarly, the participant reports high levels of happiness (Z-score of 1.64) and trust in others (Z-score of 1.47). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.8. Despite a low Body Mass Index (17.76), health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.72). Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, and exercise habits include moderate engagement in exercising with others and sports (Z-scores of 0.53 and 0.91, respectively). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, with less time spent on video games and reading.

Wearable data provide insights into the participant's physiological regulation and daily patterns. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-score of -1.07), suggesting a less structured daily rhythm. Conversely, intradaily variability is high (Z-score of 2.36), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z-score of -1.2), further supporting a less consistent daily pattern. The participant's mesor (average heart rate) is within the typical range (Z-score of -0.73), and the amplitude of their circadian rhythm is below average (Z-score of -1.29). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 5:40 PM. Resting heart rate is notably within the population average (Z-score of 0.03). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of lower-than-mesor heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM with a Z-score of 1.11 deviation from mesor) and elevated heart rate during late evening hours (e.g., 10-11 PM with a Z-score of 1.22 deviation from mesor). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score of -1.09), which is below average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is relatively high (Z-score of 0.96), suggesting variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is late, around 2:56 AM, with a standard deviation that does not deviate significantly from the population norm. The participant also engages in napping, with an average of 0.22 naps per day (Z-score of 1.75).

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population, indicating relatively low to average perceived stress. This assessment is supported by several factors. Notably, self-reported measures of psychological distress are low: the participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.07) and is classified as ""not anxious"" (STAI Z-score of -1.41). Furthermore, indicators of positive psychological states, such as self-esteem (Z-score of 1.52), happiness (Z-score of 1.64), and trust (Z-score of 1.47), are all above average. Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Z-score of -0.8), and health satisfaction is slightly elevated. While sleep duration is on the shorter side (median 6 hours 18 minutes, Z-score of -1.09), it is not accompanied by a correspondingly high PSQI score, suggesting it may not be perceived as a significant stressor. The physiological data, while showing some indicators of disrupted daily rhythms (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability), do not point towards a state of chronic physiological arousal that would typically correlate with high perceived stress. For instance, resting heart rate is average, and the mesor is not elevated. The observed elevations in heart rate deviation from the mesor in the late evening could be indicative of lifestyle patterns rather than elevated stress. The negative correlations observed between PSS and several positive psychological traits (e.g., SelfEsteem, Happy) further support a lower PSS score.

34062,26.0,0.927461139896373,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that provide insight into their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate a generally positive psychological profile. The CES-D score of 7.0 falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a Z-score of -0.66 suggesting lower-than-average depressive symptomology. Similarly, the STAI–Trait score of 36.0 classifies the participant as ""not anxious"" (Z-score: -0.52), indicating low proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem appears to be a strength, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 48.0, resulting in a Z-score of 1.38, suggesting above-average self-worth. However, the PSQI score of 10.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" with a Z-score of 1.52, placing them in the upper half of the distribution for sleep quality issues. This subjective assessment of sleep quality is further corroborated by the wearable data, which shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score: -0.11), indicating a duration close to the population mean, but with a notably higher sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score: -0.47), suggesting variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time of 23:24:31 is also within a typical range, with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score: 0.26).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with weekly consumption of beer and wine/liquor, consistent with population norms (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). They report no recreational or non-prescribed drug use (Z-scores: -0.31 and -0.11, respectively). Exercise habits are robust, with both solitary and group exercise occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07, Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23), exceeding population averages. Notably, they do not participate in sports (Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreation includes moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.01) and internet usage (Z-score: -0.49), alongside shorter durations of listening to music (Z-score: -0.72). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score: 0.16). The participant reports not engaging in video games or sedentary hobbies (Z-scores: -0.56 and -0.96, respectively), and reading is also not a reported activity (Z-score: -0.67). These habits suggest an active lifestyle with a healthy balance of social engagement and physical activity.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively low mesor (Mean of Oscillating One-parameter) heart rate of 58.67 (Z-score: -2.08), indicating a lower-than-average baseline cardiovascular activity. This is further supported by a resting heart rate of 45.7 (Z-score: -1.48), suggesting a well-conditioned cardiovascular system. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a moderate level of interdaily stability (Value: 0.36, Z-score: -0.41) and intradaily variability (Value: 0.57, Z-score: 0.17), suggesting a somewhat regular daily rhythm with moderate fluctuations. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.22, Z-score: -0.87) is lower than average, implying a less pronounced daily periodicity in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time, of heart rate is observed around 3:08 PM. Analysis of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals periods of lower-than-average heart rate during nighttime hours, particularly between 3-6 AM (Z-scores: -0.60 to -0.64), which is expected during sleep. However, there are notable elevations in heart rate during late afternoon and early evening, with significant positive deviations from the mesor between 3-4 PM (Z-score: 1.45), 5-6 PM (Z-score: 2.02), 6-7 PM (Z-score: 1.7), and 7-8 PM (Z-score: 1.16). These periods of heightened cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon and evening, coinciding with reports of disturbed sleep, may reflect physiological responses to daily stressors or an inability to effectively down-regulate post-activity. The correlation analysis shows weak to moderate positive correlations between perceived stress and elevated heart rate during late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 3-4 PM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM), aligning with the observed pattern of physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, a low resting heart rate and mesor, along with moderate self-reported happiness and trust, suggest some protective factors against high perceived stress.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** percentile of the study population. While the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI score: 10.0, Z-score: 1.52) and exhibits some elevated heart rate deviations during late afternoon and early evening hours which correlate weakly with stress, several factors suggest a relatively lower overall perceived stress level. These include low scores on depressive symptoms (CESD: 7.0, Z-score: -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI: 36.0, Z-score: -0.52), coupled with high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.38) and moderate happiness (Z-score: 1.64). Furthermore, their active lifestyle with regular exercise and social engagement, along with a low resting heart rate and mesor, points towards generally good physiological and behavioral regulation. The sleep disturbance appears to be an isolated concern rather than indicative of pervasive high stress. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence suggests the participant experiences a perceived stress level that is not significantly elevated compared to the study population.

18111,28.0,0.961139896373057,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile reveals several notable patterns that may inform their perceived stress levels. Self-reported measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 27.0, placing them in the 1.42 standard deviations above the mean for depressive symptom burden. Similarly, trait anxiety is also elevated, as indicated by an STAI score of 48.0, which is 0.66 standard deviations above the population mean. In contrast, self-esteem is reported as moderately low, with a score of 36.0, which is -0.31 standard deviations from the mean, suggesting a lower than average sense of self-worth. Happiness is also notably low, with a current score of 2.0, ranking at -1.61 standard deviations from the mean, indicating a significantly lower self-reported happiness level. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed, with a score of 8.0 and a Z-score of 0.59, suggesting subjective difficulties in sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a pattern of moderate substance use, engaging in beer and wine/liquor consumption 1-2 times per week, with corresponding Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively. Exercise habits are less frequent, with exercising alone and with others occurring 1-2 times per week (Z-scores of 0.32 and 0.53), while participation in sports is reported as not at all (Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational activities show a trend towards passive engagement, with substantial time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.64) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85). Conversely, more active or engaging leisure activities such as video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies are either not pursued or done minimally. Socializing with friends is reported for 1-2 hours, with a relatively neutral Z-score of 0.16.

Physiological data from wearable devices further illuminate the participant's daily functioning. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates an interdaily stability of 0.24 and an intradaily variability of 0.58, with Z-scores of -1.4 and 0.24 respectively, suggesting a less regular daily pattern. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably low at 6.21 (Z-score of -1.48), indicating reduced diurnal variation in heart rate. The resting heart rate is within the population average, with a value of 58.2 (Z-score of 0.01). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals elevated heart rate during late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM showing positive deviations and Z-scores up to 1.85), suggesting potential physiological activation during periods typically associated with rest. Conversely, significant negative deviations and lower Z-scores are observed during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM with Z-scores up to 0.96), which may reflect the body's response to disrupted sleep or reduced physiological activity. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes, which is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.1). However, the median sleep start time is late at 01:19:30, with a standard deviation of 69 minutes (Z-score of -0.31), and the participant reports a higher than average number of daily naps (0.27, Z-score of 2.27), suggesting potential issues with sleep consolidation and timing.

Based on the multimodal analysis, the participant's psychological and behavioral data present a consistent picture of elevated psychological distress, including significant levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with lower self-reported happiness and moderate concerns regarding sleep quality. The behavioral patterns lean towards passive leisure activities and moderate substance use, while physiological data suggest a less regular circadian rhythm and potential physiological dysregulation during typical rest periods. Given the presence of high scores in depressive symptoms and anxiety, alongside low happiness and disturbed sleep, and considering the potential impact of these factors on perceived stress, it is likely that the participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

Concurrently, the participant reports a moderate level of trait anxiety, with an STAI score of 47.0, placing them 0.56 standard deviations above the mean and classified as ""anxious."" While self-esteem is relatively average (Z-score of -0.31), health satisfaction is also within the typical range (Z-score of 0.05). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is notably poorer than average, with a score of 8.0 (Z-score of 0.59) and classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This subjective report is further supported by objective sleep data from the wearable, which indicates a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 23 minutes, a value 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, suggesting longer sleep durations that may not necessarily translate to restorative sleep given the reported poor quality.

Behavioral patterns reveal a higher than average frequency of alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score of 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.94). While sports participation is relatively frequent (1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.91), other recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are within average ranges. Notably, reading time is lower than average (15 minutes or less, Z-score of 0.32), and solitary hobbies are also utilized minimally. The participant does not report recreational or non-prescribed drug usage.

Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate monitoring highlights some potential disruptions in circadian rhythm regularity. The interdaily stability of heart rate is notably low (0.57, Z-score of 1.33), suggesting less consistent daily patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is also low (0.33, Z-score of -1.52), which may indicate periods of reduced physiological dynamism throughout the day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is elevated (14.74, Z-score of 1.28), suggesting a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate, which, in conjunction with lower stability, could reflect a less regulated physiological cycle. The mesor (79.63, Z-score of 0.78) is slightly elevated, indicating a generally higher baseline heart rate. The deviation of hourly heart rate from the mesor shows a distinct pattern of reduced activity during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM shows a deviation of -22.17, Z-score of -1.34), with a marked increase in heart rate variability during the late morning and afternoon, peaking between 11 AM and 1 PM. This pattern, alongside the reported disturbed sleep, may indicate an inefficient or dysregulated physiological response to daily demands. Correlations with perceived stress (PSS) indicate that higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety are associated with higher perceived stress, while higher self-esteem and happiness are associated with lower perceived stress. Lower intraday variability in heart rate shows a positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that a less variable physiological state might be linked to higher stress.

Considering the combined evidence of significant depressive symptoms, moderate trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, and physiological patterns suggestive of less stable circadian rhythms, this participant's overall perceived stress level is likely to place them in the top half of the study population distribution. The presence of pronounced depressive symptoms, coupled with moderate anxiety and disturbed sleep, are strong indicators of heightened psychological distress. While some behavioral aspects, like sports participation, are positive, they are overshadowed by the psychological and physiological markers of stress.

However, there are indicators of sleep disturbance. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, while not extremely high, falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, supported by a Z-score of 0.13. This subjective report is corroborated by the Fitbit-derived sleep statistics, which indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes (Z-score of -0.32), suggesting insufficient sleep relative to the study population. The median sleep start time is very late at 2:10 AM, with a standard deviation of 85 minutes, highlighting a potentially irregular sleep schedule.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, both of which have positive Z-scores indicating higher than average usage in the study population. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity levels are consistent with the study average, with exercise occurring 1-2 times per week in various forms. Daily recreational habits show a pattern of moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, and socializing with friends, with less time spent on reading and sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is also moderate.

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm analysis reveals some notable patterns. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -1.98) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of -1.79) are significantly low, indicating a less regular and structured daily rhythm. This is further suggested by the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm being low (Z-score of -1.58). The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated compared to the population (Z-score of 0.4). The hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show increased cardiovascular activity during the late morning and early evening hours, with notable peaks between 5 PM and 6 PM (deviation of 14.06, Z-score of 0.52) and 9 PM and 10 PM (deviation of 7.56, Z-score of -0.1). Conversely, the early morning hours (3 AM to 6 AM) exhibit the most significant negative deviations from the Mesor, suggesting a period of very low physiological arousal during these times, which aligns with the late sleep start time. The resting heart rate is above average for the population (Z-score of 0.78).

The correlations between various metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score provide additional context. Positive correlations are observed with mid-morning and early-morning deviations in heart rate, suggesting that higher physiological arousal during these periods might be associated with increased perceived stress. There's also a positive correlation with the Intradaily Variability of heart rate, implying that greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day could be linked to higher stress levels. Conversely, negative correlations are seen with metrics like reading time, amplitude of the heart rate rhythm, and Interdaily Stability, suggesting that engaging in reading, having a more pronounced daily heart rate variation, and maintaining a more stable circadian rhythm are associated with lower perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data suggests a profile that leans towards the lower to median range of perceived stress within the study population. Several indicators support this conclusion. The low scores on the STAI (Trait Anxiety) and CES-D (Depressive Symptoms) indicate a low baseline for psychological distress. High health satisfaction and relatively strong self-esteem further contribute to a positive psychological outlook. The academic performance is strong, which can often be a buffer against stress. While sleep quality is identified as disturbed and sleep duration is suboptimal, these issues do not appear to be leading to significant emotional distress or anxiety according to the self-report measures. The behavioral patterns, including moderate social engagement and exercise, are also within typical ranges.

However, certain physiological and behavioral metrics suggest potential areas of concern that could influence perceived stress. The significant irregularities in the circadian rhythm (low Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation) and the late sleep start time point to a potentially disruptive lifestyle pattern that can contribute to stress. The positive correlation between certain heart rate deviations during the day and PSS score, and the positive correlation with Intradaily Variability of heart rate, suggest that physiological dysregulation might be an avenue through which stress is experienced. Despite these physiological indicators, the lack of significant distress reported on psychological symptom scales suggests that the participant may have developed coping mechanisms or that their overall resilience is high enough to mitigate the impact of these irregularities on their perceived stress levels.

Considering the strong protective factors of low trait anxiety, low depressive symptomatology, good self-esteem, and academic success, the evidence points more towards a perceived stress score in the bottom 50th percentile. While there are physiological indicators of potential stress vulnerability (circadian rhythm disruption), these do not manifest as heightened subjective distress on the primary psychological measures. Therefore, the participant is likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution for perceived stress.

84502,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that inform their perceived stress levels. Notably, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0, with a Z-score of 1.52, indicates significantly disturbed sleep quality, placing them in the upper quartile for this metric within the study population. This objective finding is corroborated by a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 31 minutes, which, while not extremely low, has a Z-score of 0.41, suggesting it is slightly longer than the average. However, the sleep start time exhibits considerable variability, with a standard deviation of 65 minutes and a Z-score of -0.39, indicating a tendency towards inconsistent sleep schedules.

Behaviorally, the participant reports exercising with others three times a week or more, a frequency that is notably higher than the average (Z-score of 1.23). Conversely, sports participation is infrequent, occurring less than once or twice a month (Z-score of -0.42). Daily recreational habits show a moderate engagement with internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.18) and listening to music (16-30 minutes, Z-score of -0.26), but a low engagement with reading (15 minutes or less, Z-score of 0.32) and a complete absence of watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games. Notably, social interaction with friends is reported for 31 minutes to an hour, with a Z-score of -0.62 suggesting less frequent social engagement in this specific manner. No substance usage was reported, with Z-scores consistently below average for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics reveal moderate regularity. The Interdaily Stability of 0.55 (Z-score of 1.16) suggests a relatively structured daily pattern in heart rate, while the Intradaily Variability of 0.55 (Z-score of 0.03) indicates a typical level of fluctuation within the day. The mesor of 67.03 (Z-score of -0.94) is below the population mean, suggesting a lower average heart rate. The acrophase occurs at 4:08 PM, and the amplitude of 12.41 (Z-score of 0.53) suggests a noticeable daily variation in heart rate. A notable pattern emerges from the aggregated hourly heart rate data relative to the mesor. The participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rates during the late afternoon and early evening (4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.54, 5-6 PM with a Z-score of 2.07, and 6-7 PM with a Z-score of 1.61), which deviates substantially from their typical daily rhythm. Conversely, the early morning hours (12 AM to 7 AM) show marked deviations below the mesor, particularly between 1 AM and 6 AM, suggesting periods of lower cardiovascular activity during sleep or early waking hours. The resting heart rate of 52.6 bpm, with a Z-score of -0.66, is also relatively low.

In terms of psychological measures, the participant reports a CES-D score of 18.0 (Z-score of 0.49), indicating a mild to moderate level of depressive symptoms. Their STAI–Trait score is 38.0 (Z-score of -0.33), suggesting they are not particularly prone to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is reported at 41.0, which, given the scale's maximum is 40, indicates they have reached the maximum possible score for self-esteem, exceeding the population average (Z-score not provided for self-esteem but the score itself is high). Health satisfaction is moderate at 5.22 (Z-score of 0.72), and trust in others is relatively high at 3.67 (Z-score of 0.83). Happiness is reported at 3.0, with a Z-score of -0.53, suggesting a lower than average current happiness level.

The participant's PSS score places them in the top 50% of the study population. While specific PSS scores are not provided, the collective data suggests a profile indicative of elevated perceived stress. The most salient indicators are the significantly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score of 1.52) and the elevated heart rate deviations during late afternoon and early evening, potentially reflecting acute stress responses during this period. While traits like low anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score of -0.33) and high self-esteem are protective factors, the presence of moderate depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score of 0.49) and lower-than-average happiness (Happy Z-score of -0.53) are consistent with higher stress experiences. Furthermore, the overall pattern of physiological arousal, characterized by late afternoon/early evening heart rate elevations, combined with sleep disturbances, points towards an individual likely experiencing significant stress that impacts their daily functioning and physiological regulation.

78783,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant careful consideration in the context of perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a tendency towards anxiety, as evidenced by a Z-score of 0.17 on the STAI-Trait scale, suggesting proneness to chronic anxiety. This aligns with a lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Z-score of -1.61), suggesting a subjective experience of less positive affect. Conversely, the participant reports moderate self-esteem (Z-score of 0.11), falling within the average range, and a relatively neutral stance on trust of others (Z-score of 0.83). Depressive symptoms are minimal, with a CES-D score indicating no significant depressive burden. Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score of -1.11), suggesting potential underlying dissatisfaction with physical well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pattern of regular physical activity, engaging in solo exercise three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07) and exercising with others 1-2 times a week. Sports participation is also moderate (1-2 times a week). Substance use is infrequent, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a month, and recreational and non-prescribed drugs used not at all. Daily recreational habits show a significant engagement with video games (Z-score of 1.71), alongside moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music. Internet usage and socializing with friends are within average ranges. Notably, reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are minimal or absent.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a circadian rhythm characterized by a relatively low Mesor (Z-score of -0.58), indicating a lower average heart rate compared to the population. The amplitude of the rhythm is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.49), suggesting a broader range of heart rate variation throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is recorded at 6:24 PM. Sleep patterns are marked by a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 52 minutes (Z-score of -0.39), which is slightly below average. However, the variability in sleep duration and sleep start time is considerable, with standard deviations for both metrics being above the population average (Z-scores of 1.13 and 1.99, respectively). This suggests inconsistency in sleep onset and duration. The prevalence of napping is also higher than average (Z-score of 2.23). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates pronounced negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), suggesting significant cardiovascular deceleration during these periods, which is expected during sleep. More pronounced positive deviations are observed during the late afternoon and evening hours, particularly between 7-8 PM and 10-11 PM, potentially reflecting periods of higher arousal or activity.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), appears to place them in the lower half of the study population distribution. While the participant exhibits some indicators potentially associated with stress, such as elevated anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: 0.17) and poorer subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: 0.59), these are not overwhelmingly high. Importantly, self-reported happiness is significantly lower than average (Z-score: -1.61), and health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score: -1.11). The data on sleep quality and quantity are mixed; while the median sleep duration is slightly below average, the high variability in sleep start time and duration suggests inconsistency, which can be a stressor. However, the low correlation coefficients between most of these measures and the PSS score suggest they do not strongly drive perceived stress within this dataset. Moreover, the participant demonstrates consistent engagement in physical activity, which is often a protective factor against stress. The Z-scores for CES-D, Self-Esteem, Trust, and Substance Usage do not indicate significant distress in these areas. Given the absence of strongly elevated PSS-related indicators and the presence of some potentially mitigating factors, it is reasonable to infer that the participant's PSS score likely falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

25197,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics. Their self-reported anxiety proneness (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86) is notably elevated, suggesting a tendency towards experiencing anxiety. This is accompanied by a moderate self-esteem score (44.0, Z-score 0.82), which is paradoxically high given the interpretation that higher scores indicate greater self-esteem, and thus this should be interpreted as relatively high self-esteem. While depressive symptoms are reported as not depressed (CESD score of 10.0, Z-score -0.34), the elevated anxiety may be a significant contributing factor to their overall psychological state.

Behaviorally, this participant reports moderate substance usage, engaging in drinking beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which falls into a higher Z-score category, indicating more frequent usage compared to the population. Notably, they report no recreational or non-prescribed drug usage. Their exercise habits are mixed; they exercise alone and with others 1-2 times a week, which are moderate frequencies. However, their engagement in sports is infrequent (less than 1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits show a tendency towards lower engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25) and higher engagement in internet usage (Z-score -0.49), listening to music (Z-score -0.26), and socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62), though the latter is still relatively low compared to population averages. Reading is performed for 15 minutes or less (Z-score 0.32), indicating a lower engagement in this activity.

Physiologically, the participant displays a relatively low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm, Z-score -0.68), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a moderate interdaily stability (0.42, Z-score 0.09) and lower intradaily variability (0.47, Z-score -0.53), suggesting a degree of regularity in their daily physiological patterns. The Mesor (67.71, Z-score -0.85) is lower than the population average, indicating a generally lower baseline heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak time of heart rate, occurs at 4:02 PM. The amplitude of heart rate variation is somewhat elevated (12.77, Z-score 0.64), suggesting larger fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, which could be linked to stress or activity.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant patterns. There are pronounced deviations during the late afternoon and early evening hours, with the 3-4 PM period showing a substantial positive deviation (38.33, Z-score 5.3). This peak suggests heightened physiological arousal during this time. The period between 4-5 PM also shows a significant positive deviation (18.77, Z-score 1.48). Conversely, early morning hours (1-6 AM) exhibit consistently negative deviations from the mesor, indicating lower than average heart rate during sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score -0.77), which is below the population average, and a lower than average sleep duration standard deviation (61 minutes, Z-score -0.91), suggesting more consistent, albeit shorter, sleep. The median sleep start time is late at 01:45:45 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (56 minutes, Z-score -0.58), indicating a tendency towards a delayed sleep schedule. The absence of naps (0.0, Z-score -0.86) is also noted. The PSQI score of 7.0, while classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and above the threshold of 5, has a low Z-score (0.13), suggesting this is not particularly high relative to the study population. However, the combination of shorter sleep duration and a late sleep start time may contribute to perceived stress.

The correlations provided suggest that higher perceived stress is associated with higher anxiety (STAI correlation 0.31) and lower happiness (correlation -0.19). While there are no direct correlations with the PSS score provided for the CES-D, STAI, or SelfEsteem, their general classifications and Z-scores are important contextual factors. The elevated anxiety, combined with a pattern of physiological arousal in the afternoon, and shorter, later sleep, are key indicators that may influence perceived stress.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score likely falls within the bottom 50% of the study population. While elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.86) and a tendency for disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7.0, though low Z-score) are noted, the overall pattern of data does not strongly suggest high perceived stress. The relatively low CES-D score, higher than average self-esteem, and lower resting heart rate are indicative of a resilient psychological profile. Furthermore, the physiological data, while showing some afternoon arousal, does not indicate pervasive physiological dysregulation that would typically accompany very high stress levels. The shorter sleep duration and late sleep onset are noteworthy, but their impact on overall perceived stress is moderate when considered alongside other factors. The negative correlations with reading and exercise frequency are also less indicative of very high stress.

23270,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological data. Self-reported measures indicate a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.24), consistent with a ""Not depressed"" classification, and a moderate level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score = -0.17). However, the STAI-Trait anxiety scale score of 47.0, with a Z-score of 0.56, suggests a proneness to anxiety that is above the population average. Happiness is reported as average (Happy Z-score = 0.55), and health satisfaction is slightly elevated (Health Satisfaction Z-score = 0.55). Trust in others is reported at a level below the population average (Trust Z-score = -0.46). The participant reports good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score = -1.26), falling within the ""Good Sleep"" classification.

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a low engagement with substance use, reporting no consumption of beer, wine or liquor, or recreational drugs. Similarly, non-prescribed drug use is also reported as not occurring. In terms of physical activity, there is a notable emphasis on exercise, with the participant exercising alone ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score = 1.07) and engaging in sports ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score = 1.58). Exercise with others occurs ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score = 0.53). Sedentary habits are generally low, with no time reported for watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is moderate, reported as ""1-2 hours"" (Z-score = 0.18). Reading is not a frequent activity (""Do not do,"" Z-score = -0.67).

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability, a measure of day-to-day regularity, is slightly below average (Value = 0.38, Z-score = -0.24), while intradaily variability, reflecting activity fluctuations within a day, is slightly above average (Value = 0.6, Z-score = 0.39). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is near the population average (Value = 0.32, Z-score = -0.03). The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the day, is below the population average (Value = 69.51, Z-score = -0.61), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also near the population average (Value = 10.72, Z-score = -0.02). The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is observed at 2:42 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is also below the population average (Value = 54.9, Z-score = -0.39).

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of significantly elevated physiological arousal during typical daytime working hours, particularly between 8-9 AM (Z-score = 1.6) and 9-10 AM (Z-score = 2.06), with sustained elevated levels through 10-11 AM (Z-score = 1.92) and 11 AM-12 PM (Z-score = 1.29). There are also notable peaks in the afternoon, including 12-1 PM (Z-score = 1.49) and 4-5 PM (Z-score = 1.05). Conversely, significant deviations below the mesor are observed during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, Z-score = -1.9; 1-2 AM, Z-score = -1.23; 2-3 AM, Z-score = -0.91), suggesting a pattern of reduced cardiovascular activity during the typical sleep period. The participant exhibits exceptionally long sleep durations, with a median of 8 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score = 2.03), significantly exceeding the population average. Sleep start times are also relatively consistent, with a median start time of 22:50:14 and a standard deviation of 79 minutes (Z-score = -0.09). Napping is not reported.

Considering the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** of the study population distribution. This assessment is based on several factors. While the participant reports a tendency towards anxiety (STAI-Trait Z-score = 0.56), their self-reported depression symptoms are low (CES-D Z-score = -0.24), and self-esteem is near average. Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Z-score = -1.26), and objective sleep duration is significantly longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = 2.03), suggesting adequate restorative sleep which can buffer stress. The participant also engages in frequent physical activity, including sports, which are known to be stress-reducing. Furthermore, the absence of substance use and generally low sedentary habits point towards healthy coping mechanisms.

While there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation from the mesor during typical waking hours, particularly in the morning and late afternoon, these patterns may reflect engagement in demanding activities or physiological responses to daily routines rather than pervasive stress. The positive correlations between some physiological measures (e.g., elevated heart rate deviation during certain hours, resting heart rate) and PSS score are noted, but these are outweighed by the strong indicators of good subjective well-being, healthy lifestyle choices, and robust sleep. The negative correlation between SelfEsteem and PSS, and the positive correlation between STAI and PSS, suggest that lower self-esteem and higher anxiety would contribute to higher PSS, which this participant does not strongly exhibit. The data collectively suggests a participant who, despite some proneness to anxiety, utilizes effective coping strategies and maintains healthy habits, likely resulting in a perceived stress level that is not in the upper half of the population distribution.

70125,29.0,0.9715025906735751,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that may influence their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate elevated levels of both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86). While self-esteem is within the average range (Score 39.0, Z-Score 0.11), the presence of significant depressive and anxious symptomatology, coupled with a lower-than-average trust score (Score 2.33, Z-Score -1.74), suggests a potential vulnerability to stress. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score of 7.0, Z-Score 0.13), aligning with Fitbit data indicating a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours and 57 minutes, which falls slightly below the average for the study population (Z-Score -0.29). Furthermore, the standard deviation of sleep duration is notably high (159 minutes, Z-Score 1.32), suggesting variability and potential disruption in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is late at 01:44:30 AM, with a substantial standard deviation (99 minutes, Z-Score 0.36), indicating irregularity in sleep scheduling.

Behavioral habits reveal a moderate level of substance use, with the participant reporting consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times per week, which is above the average frequency for these activities within the study population (Z-Scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively). Conversely, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Physical activity levels show a pattern of regular exercise alone (three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.07) but less frequent exercise with others and sports participation. Daily recreational habits include relatively low engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, and minimal to no engagement in video games or reading. Internet usage is reported as 2-3 hours daily, which is higher than average (Z-Score 0.85). Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes an hour, indicating a moderate social engagement.

Physiological data from the wearable device provide further insights. The participant's circadian rhythm, as measured by heart rate variability, shows moderate regularity (Interdaily Stability Z-Score -0.57) and variability (Intradaily Variability Z-Score -0.25). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Value 0.24, Z-Score -0.7), suggesting a reduced adherence to a strict 24-hour cycle in their heart rate patterns. The Mesor (average heart rate rhythm) is slightly below average (Value 70.95, Z-Score -0.41), and the amplitude of the daily heart rate variation is also lower than average (Value 9.18, Z-Score -0.52). The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late at 5:03 PM. The resting heart rate is notably low (Value 53.0, Z-Score -0.61). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals periods of increased cardiovascular arousal during evening hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (Value 17.41, Z-Score 1.03) and 8-9 PM (Value 12.18, Z-Score 0.45), which may correspond to periods of stress or heightened activity. Conversely, early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM) show the largest negative deviations from the Mesor, indicating a period of significant physiological rest.

Considering the participant's elevated scores in depression and anxiety, irregular sleep patterns with reduced duration and increased variability, moderate substance use, and certain physiological indicators such as late acrophase and evening heart rate elevation, it is likely that this participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution. The combination of psychological distress and behavioral/physiological markers indicative of potential dysregulation points towards a higher perceived stress burden.

67192,31.0,0.9948186528497409,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a constellation of self-reported psychological and behavioral indicators that suggest elevated levels of distress and negative affect. Notably, the CES-D score of 32.0, with a Z-score of 1.95, falls into the ""Depressed"" classification, indicating a significant burden of depressive symptoms. Complementing this, the STAI–Trait score of 58.0, with a Z-score of 1.65, places the participant in the ""anxious"" classification, suggesting a propensity for chronic anxiety. These scores are positively correlated with perceived stress, with the STAI showing a slightly stronger positive correlation (0.31) compared to the CES-D (0.27). Conversely, self-esteem appears relatively preserved, with a Z-score of -0.73, indicating a position in the lower half of the distribution for self-worth, and a weak negative correlation (-0.15) with perceived stress. Happiness levels are also reported to be low, with a Z-score of -1.61, and a moderate negative correlation of -0.18 with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is notably low, with a Z-score of -2.03, suggesting a significant dissatisfaction with their physical health, although this has a weak negative correlation (-0.06) with perceived stress. Trust in others is also markedly low, with a Z-score of -2.39, indicating a significant deficit in this area, and a negligible correlation (-0.02) with perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns reveal a mix of sedentary and social activities that may be compensatory. The participant reports moderate weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94) and engaging in exercise alone and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-scores 0.32 and 0.53 respectively), while sports are not engaged in at all (Z-score -1.09). Daily habits indicate a substantial engagement in leisure activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28), video games (1-2 hours, Z-score 2.47), internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13). Notably, the participant reports spending ""more than 4 hours"" socializing with friends, which has a high Z-score of 2.53 and a modest positive correlation (0.04) with perceived stress, suggesting that social connection may be a significant, albeit potentially stress-associated, behavior. Conversely, reading (Z-score -0.67) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96) are not frequently engaged in. These leisure activities, particularly video games and extensive social interaction, may be indicative of coping mechanisms, potentially to manage underlying distress.

Physiological and circadian data reveal some deviations from typical patterns. The participant exhibits a higher than average Mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint) for heart rate, with a Z-score of 2.01, suggesting generally elevated cardiovascular activity. This is further supported by a higher than average resting heart rate (Z-score 1.62). The circadian rhythm exhibits moderate interdaily stability (Z-score 0.91), indicating some regularity in daily patterns, but the autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.23) suggests a tendency for a slightly less predictable daily cycle. The acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported as ""5:12 PM"". Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 10-11 PM (deviation of 16.29, Z-score 1.55) and 5-6 AM (deviation of -20.79, Z-score -0.35), though this latter value is negative, suggesting a dip. The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score 0.1), which is close to average, but a substantial standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score 0.16) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.59) suggests variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is approximately 1:15 AM. The PSQI score of 7.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" with a Z-score of 0.13, aligns with the observed variability in sleep start times and durations, suggesting subjective sleep quality concerns despite a seemingly adequate median duration.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant exhibits a number of indicators suggestive of elevated perceived stress. The self-reported scores for depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 1.95) and anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.65) are significantly above the population mean, placing them in the upper quartile for these measures. These psychological distress markers are positively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports low happiness (Z-score -1.61) and health satisfaction (Z-score -2.03), which, while having weaker correlations with perceived stress, are consistent with a general state of psychological burden.

While some behavioral factors such as extensive social interaction (Z-score 2.53) and moderate alcohol consumption (Z-score 0.94) are present, they do not necessarily mitigate the indicators of psychological distress. Physiological data, including an elevated mesor (Z-score 2.01) and resting heart rate (Z-score 1.62), along with disturbed sleep patterns (PSQI classification), further suggest a state of physiological strain that is often associated with higher perceived stress. The median PSS score for the study population is 22.0, with the 75th percentile at 24.0. Given the significant elevations in key psychological distress measures (CES-D and STAI) and supporting physiological and sleep data, it is plausible that this participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

97448,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This individual presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral indicators alongside physiological data, all of which require careful consideration in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a generally low level of distress. The CES-D score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.07) suggests infrequent depressive symptoms, and the STAI-Trait score of 33.0 (Z-score -0.82) indicates a low propensity for chronic anxiety. Similarly, self-esteem is relatively high, with a score of 41.0 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, which falls slightly above the typical scoring range for this instrument. Subjective happiness is also reported as being above average (Z-score -0.53). Trust in others is notably high (Z-score 1.47), and health satisfaction is moderately positive (Z-score -0.45).

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed pattern. Substance use, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times per week, placing this participant in the upper quartile of usage within the study population (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively). However, recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as non-existent. Physical activity is characterized by exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), which is a relatively high frequency. Conversely, exercising with others and participating in sports are infrequent. Daily recreational activities show a moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with listening to music and sedentary hobbies occurring less frequently. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, a duration that is slightly above average (Z-score 0.16), while reading is less frequent. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Score 6.0, Z-Score -0.33), suggesting a subjective experience of poor sleep despite a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score 0.02). The median sleep start time is early morning (01:44:30), and the variability in sleep duration and start time is within the typical range.

Physiological data from the wearable device offers further insights. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively regular pattern of heart rate variation, as indicated by a high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score -0.04). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also moderately high (Z-score 1.15), suggesting some regularity in daily heart rate patterns. The mesor, representing the average daily heart rate, is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.16), and the resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score -0.87), suggesting a potentially good baseline cardiovascular fitness. However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score 1.29), indicating a larger fluctuation between peak and trough heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is recorded at 5:00 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal significant periods of elevated heart rate compared to the mesor during evening and late-night hours, specifically between 8-9 PM (Z-score 2.1) and 9-10 PM (Z-score 2.14), and to a lesser extent between 2-3 PM (Z-score 2.23) and 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.4). Conversely, early morning hours (3-7 AM) show pronounced deviations below the mesor, indicative of lower physiological arousal during typical sleep periods.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the provided data in conjunction with the population PSS statistics, the participant's overall perceived stress level would likely place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution. While the participant reports some behaviors that might be associated with stress, such as moderate substance usage and a disturbed subjective sleep quality, these are counterbalanced by several factors suggesting lower perceived stress. The absence of significant depressive or anxious symptoms, high self-esteem, and moderate happiness levels are strong indicators of psychological well-being. Furthermore, the physiological data, despite some elevated heart rate periods in the evening, does not overwhelmingly suggest a chronic state of physiological hyperarousal that would typically correlate with high perceived stress. The regular circadian rhythm metrics and lower-than-average resting heart rate are also points towards a more regulated physiological state. The correlation coefficients provided for individual metrics, while generally small in magnitude, do not strongly point towards a high PSS score. For instance, while some metrics like STAI and CES-D have positive correlations with PSS, their low scores for this participant suggest that even with these correlations, their absolute values remain low. The PSQI's correlation with PSS is not provided, but the subjective disturbance of sleep might be a factor. However, given the overall constellation of low psychological distress indicators, the participant is more likely to fall within the bottom 50% of PSS scores.

67177,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that inform their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicate moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.46), suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing negative affect. However, self-esteem is relatively low (RSES Z-score = -1.01), coupled with significantly lower self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score = -1.61) and health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z-score = -1.2). These findings collectively suggest a negative affective bias and potential challenges in maintaining positive self-regard, which are often associated with elevated stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a generally sedentary lifestyle. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, which is a positive indicator. However, engagement in physical activity is notably low, with ""Not at all"" reported for Exercised Alone, Exercised with Others, and Sports. Daily recreational habits show a pattern of higher engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.28) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13), alongside moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.85). Notably, active or engaging leisure activities such as reading, socializing with friends, and sedentary hobbies are reported at minimal to no engagement. This profile suggests a lack of engagement in stress-reducing behaviors and potentially a reliance on less active forms of leisure.

Physiologically, wearable data reveal a circadian rhythm characterized by a relatively high Mesor (Z-score = 1.11) and Amplitude (Z-score = 0.82), indicating a robust, albeit potentially elevated, physiological oscillation. The acrophase at 4:34 PM suggests the peak of this rhythm occurs in the late afternoon. Interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.24) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 1.4) are also higher than average, suggesting a more regular daily pattern in heart rate variability. However, the participant's resting heart rate is also elevated (Z-score = 0.84). Hourly heart rate data reveal significant deviations from the Mesor, particularly during the evening and late night hours (e.g., 5-6 PM: 17.77, 7-8 PM: 17.35), indicating periods of heightened cardiovascular arousal. Conversely, early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: -15.1, 2-3 AM: -16.73) show a marked reduction in heart rate, suggesting a consistent wind-down period. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 54 minutes, which is slightly below average for the study population (Z-score = -0.35), and a median sleep start time around midnight, with some variability. The PSQI score of 7.0 suggests subjectively disturbed sleep, aligning with the potentially insufficient sleep duration.

The correlation between PSS scores and various metrics provides further insight. A positive correlation between CES-D and STAI scores with PSS supports the notion that depressive and anxious symptoms contribute to perceived stress. Lower self-esteem, trust, and happiness are also negatively correlated with PSS, indicating that these psychological states are associated with lower perceived stress. Conversely, higher engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV and internet usage show a slight positive correlation with PSS, while reading shows a negative correlation, suggesting that passive leisure may not effectively buffer stress. In terms of physiological data, higher resting heart rate and certain evening/nighttime deviations from the Mesor are positively correlated with PSS, highlighting the link between physiological arousal and perceived stress. Regularity in sleep patterns (lower Sleep Duration Standard Deviation, lower Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation) are weakly correlated with lower PSS, suggesting that stable sleep can be beneficial.

Overall, the participant exhibits elevated levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and a general tendency towards sedentary behavior and passive leisure. This is complemented by physiological indicators of heightened arousal during certain parts of the day and a potentially insufficient and subjectively disturbed sleep pattern. These factors, particularly the combination of negative affect, low engagement in beneficial behaviors, and physiological dysregulation, suggest that the participant is likely experiencing significant perceived stress.

Considering the participant's elevated levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with low self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, these psychological indicators strongly suggest a higher perceived stress level. The sedentary lifestyle and lack of engagement in stress-mitigating activities, such as exercise and active leisure, further contribute to this. While some physiological metrics like interdaily stability and autocorrelation suggest regularity, the elevated resting heart rate and periods of increased cardiovascular arousal, particularly in the evening, are consistent with higher stress. The slightly suboptimal sleep duration and reported disturbed sleep quality also play a role. Given the convergence of these factors, particularly the negative psychological markers and lack of stress-buffering behaviors, the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely to place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

87328,15.0,0.038860103626943004,"This participant presents with a complex profile that warrants a multimodal interpretation of perceived stress. Self-reported psychological traits indicate a state of relatively low anxiety and depression, with a notably low STAI-Trait score (Z-score: -1.81) and a non-depressed CES-D classification (Z-score: -1.38). This suggests a baseline disposition towards lower levels of psychological distress. However, self-esteem and happiness are elevated relative to the study population (SelfEsteem Z-Score: 1.66, Happy Z-Score: 1.64), which could act as protective factors against stress. Conversely, the participant's PSQI score (Score: 7.0, Z-Score: 0.13) suggests disturbed sleep, exceeding the commonly cited threshold of 5 for significant sleep issues, indicating a potential area of vulnerability. Their BMI of 27.12 falls into the overweight category. Health satisfaction is also relatively low (Z-score: -1.2), which, coupled with sleep disturbance, may contribute to an overall perception of compromised well-being.

Behaviorally, substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is a positive indicator. Exercise habits show moderate engagement in sports (Frequency: ""1-2 times a week"", Z-Score: 0.91), but lower frequency of exercising alone or with others. Daily recreation habits reveal a significant time commitment to sedentary activities, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (Time: ""3-4 hours"", Z-Score: 2.54) and socializing with friends (Time: ""more than 4 hours"", Z-Score: 2.53). Reading time is also notably high (Time: ""31 minutes an hour"", Z-Score: 2.28), alongside moderate internet usage and listening to music. This pattern of high engagement in passive and social leisure activities might reflect coping mechanisms or preferences that could be influenced by perceived stress levels.

Wearable data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.53, Z-Score: 1.0) and moderate Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.51, Z-Score: 1.57). However, the Intradaily Variability is relatively low (Value: 0.51, Z-Score: -0.25), which, in conjunction with a higher amplitude (Value: 16.28, Z-Score: 1.78), suggests a pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase at 5:40 PM indicates the peak heart rate typically occurs in the late afternoon/early evening. Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows notable deviations from the mesor during the night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 7 AM, with significant negative deviations (e.g., 4-5 AM, Z-Score: -1.14). Conversely, evening hours, especially between 6 PM and 7 PM (Z-Score: 2.62), exhibit the largest positive deviations, indicating periods of elevated cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is within the lower range of the population (Value: 54.4, Z-Score: -0.45). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes (Z-Score: 0.3), which is slightly above the population mean, but the sleep start time shows considerable variability (Median: 01:26:15, Standard Deviation: 50 minutes, Z-Score: -0.72). The participant also engages in a small number of daily naps (Mean: 0.18, Z-Score: 1.21), which, coupled with the disturbed sleep quality indicated by the PSQI, may suggest fragmented or insufficient restorative sleep.

The participant's self-reported low anxiety and depression scores, along with high self-esteem and happiness, initially suggest a low stress profile. However, the disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), lower health satisfaction, and a high overall PSS score (mean 21.63, 50th percentile 22.0) suggest that this individual may be experiencing a moderate to elevated level of perceived stress. The significant time spent in sedentary leisure activities and the pronounced evening heart rate elevation could be indicative of stress-related behaviors or physiological responses. While some physiological metrics suggest a robust circadian system (e.g., interdaily stability), the high amplitude and late-night heart rate variability might point towards disruptions, potentially exacerbated by underlying stress. The correlation between PSS and several metrics, such as a positive correlation with early morning heart rate deviations and negative correlations with reading and sports frequency, hints at potential behavioral and physiological manifestations of stress. Given the average PSS population score of 21.63 and the individual’s PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, which is often linked to higher perceived stress, it is plausible that this participant falls within the higher half of the distribution.

49497,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by elevated levels of psychological distress and disrupted sleep patterns, alongside a generally sedentary lifestyle with specific substance use habits. High scores on the CES-D (49.0, Z=3.71) and STAI (64.0, Z=2.24) indicate significant depressive and anxious symptomatology, respectively. These findings are further supported by a low self-esteem score (22.0, Z=-2.28) and a low self-reported happiness level (2.0, Z=-1.61). The PSQI score of 9.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" aligns with the wearable data, which shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes (Z=-0.85) and a notably high standard deviation in sleep start time (204 minutes, Z=2.65), suggesting considerable irregularity in sleep scheduling.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate recreational substance use, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs, all at a frequency of 1-2 times per week, with recreational drug usage showing a particularly high Z-score of 5.44, indicating this is infrequent compared to the general population. While they exercise alone three times a week or more (Z=1.07), they do not exercise with others (Z=-1.58) and participate in sports only 1-2 times a week (Z=0.91), suggesting limited social engagement in physical activity. Daily recreational habits lean towards passive consumption, with significant internet usage (3-4 hours, Z=1.52) and moderate time spent listening to music. Notably, activities that could indicate social connection, such as socializing with friends, are reported for only 16-30 minutes (Z=-1.41), and reading is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z=0.32).

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm metrics reveal some disruptions. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.21, Z=-1.65), suggesting a lack of regularity in daily physiological patterns. This is contrasted by a relatively high intraday variability (0.63, Z=0.6), indicating significant fluctuations within a 24-hour period. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also low (5.95, Z=-1.56), potentially reflecting a blunted physiological response to daily demands. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows the most pronounced deviations from the mesor occurring during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -12.04, Z=0.68; 4-5 AM: -13.03, Z=0.84; 5-6 AM: -14.7, Z=0.53), followed by a sharp increase in positive deviations during the late morning to early afternoon (e.g., 9-10 AM: 14.41, Z=1.45; 10-11 AM: 10.53, Z=0.79). These patterns, particularly the pronounced negative deviations in the early morning, could be indicative of an unaligned circadian system or stress-related physiological responses.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data strongly suggests a high perceived stress level, likely placing them in the top 50% of the study population. The elevated scores on measures of depression (CES-D Z=3.71) and anxiety (STAI Z=2.24) are significant indicators of psychological distress, which are highly correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, the low self-esteem (Z=-2.28) and low self-reported happiness (Z=-1.61) contribute to a profile consistent with elevated stress. The disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score (9.0) and irregular sleep start times (Z=2.65), is a common consequence and contributor to high stress levels. The low interdaily stability in heart rate (Z=-1.65) also suggests a lack of consistent physiological regulation, which can be a manifestation of chronic stress. While some behavioral aspects like moderate exercise alone and listening to music might offer coping mechanisms, the overall pattern of significant psychological distress, sleep disruption, and limited social engagement in activities points towards a high perceived stress burden. The correlation coefficients, while not overriding the holistic analysis, generally show a tendency for negative outcomes (e.g., lower self-esteem, less socialization, less reading) to be associated with higher PSS scores, further supporting the interpretation of elevated stress.

33785,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral indicators that may be associated with perceived stress. Self-reported measures reveal elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 1.42) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.45), both of which are significantly above the study population mean. Conversely, self-esteem is within the average range for the population (Z-score = -0.87), and trust in others is also at an average level (Z-score = -0.14). Happiness is reported at a slightly above average level (Z-score = 0.55). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistent and strong across semesters. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is indicative of disturbed sleep (Z-score = 0.13), although this is only slightly above the threshold for clinically significant disturbance.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pattern of higher-than-average engagement in sedentary activities, particularly video gaming (Z-score = 2.47) and other sedentary hobbies (Z-score = 2.01). Exercise habits are mixed; while they exercise alone with a high frequency (Z-score = 1.07), participation in sports is notably absent (Z-score = -1.09), and exercise with others is infrequent. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, is generally at or below the average frequency for the study population.

Physiological data from the wearable device indicate a relatively regular circadian rhythm, with moderate interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.58) and low intradaily variability (Z-score = -2.08). The mesor (average heart rate across the 24-hour cycle) is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Z-score = 0.39), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also above average (Z-score = 0.54). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon. Hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., -23.45 deviation from mesor at 5-6 am), followed by a gradual increase throughout the day, peaking in the late evening hours (e.g., 14.02 deviation from mesor at 10-11 pm). Resting heart rate is within the average range for the population (Z-score = 0.07). Sleep statistics indicate a healthy average sleep duration (7 hours 20 minutes), with slightly above average variability in duration and a stable sleep start time, suggesting good sleep regularity despite subjective reports of disturbed sleep.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data presents a complex picture with some indicators potentially contributing to higher perceived stress and others to lower or average perceived stress. The elevated scores on the CES-D and STAI scales, reflecting higher depressive and anxious symptomatology, are significant and generally correlate with higher perceived stress. These elevated psychological distress markers are the most prominent predictors of potential stress. While the participant engages in sedentary behaviors like video gaming and has limited sports participation, these are not as strongly correlated with PSS as are anxiety and depression symptoms.

Conversely, factors such as good academic performance, average self-esteem and trust, relatively stable sleep duration, and a generally regular circadian rhythm might suggest a capacity to manage stress or a lower baseline stress level. The correlations provided for individual metrics offer some guidance; for instance, the positive correlation between the deviation of heart rate from the mesor during the 2-3 am, 3-4 am, 4-5 am, 5-6 am, 6-7 am, and 10-11 pm hours and PSS score suggests that deviations during these specific times may be indicative of higher stress. However, without direct PSS scores for comparison, a holistic interpretation is required.

Considering the significant elevation in anxiety and depressive symptoms (both with Z-scores above 1.4), which are known to strongly influence perceived stress, it is more likely that this participant falls within the top 50% of the study population regarding their PSS score. While other factors suggest some resilience, the psychological distress indicators are a strong signal for elevated perceived stress.

Psychologically, the participant reports a moderate level of anxiety, with a STAI score of 40.0, which falls within the ""anxious"" classification and has a Z-score of -0.13, indicating a slight tendency towards lower anxiety compared to the study population. This is further supported by a CESD score of 9.0 (Z-score -0.45) which suggests no significant depressive symptoms, and a high self-esteem score of 40.0 (Z-score 0.26). Health satisfaction and trust levels are notably lower than the population average, with Z-scores of -0.45 and -0.46 respectively, potentially reflecting underlying concerns or a more reserved disposition.

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates generally healthy lifestyle choices. Their exercise habits are moderately engaged, with solo and group exercise occurring 1-2 times a week, and sports participation 1-2 times a month, with Z-scores generally indicating average to slightly above average engagement compared to peers. Substance use leans towards lower frequencies, with beer consumed 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreation habits show a preference for less time-intensive activities, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less), and minimal time on video games and listening to music, suggesting a deliberate approach to managing leisure time. Notably, internet usage and socializing with friends are reported at 1-2 hours per day, indicating a balanced social engagement.

Physiologically, as measured by wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits relative regularity. The Mesor of 68.76 (Z-score -0.71) and amplitude of 7.95 (Z-score -0.92) suggest a lower-than-average baseline heart rate and a narrower daily fluctuation. Interdaily stability of 0.35 (Z-score -0.49) indicates a moderate level of daily rhythm consistency, while intraday variability of 0.62 (Z-score 0.53) suggests a somewhat more variable heart rate throughout the day compared to the population. The acrophase of 3:51 PM points to the peak of their circadian rhythm in the mid-afternoon. Sleep statistics reveal a generally good sleep duration, with a median of 7 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score 0.89), which is longer than the average, though the standard deviation of sleep duration (55 minutes, Z-score -1.03) suggests some nightly variability. The median sleep start time is late (00:51:00), with a standard deviation of 55 minutes, indicating some inconsistency in sleep onset. The absence of reported naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score -0.86) is consistent with generally sufficient nightly sleep. The participant's resting heart rate is within the population norm (Value 58.1, Z-score -0.01). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a tendency towards lower than expected heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-6 AM), potentially reflecting deep sleep. Conversely, there are periods of higher than average heart rate deviations in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, 1-3 PM, 3-4 PM), which could correspond to periods of increased cognitive or physical activity.

Considering the overall pattern of data, the participant presents with generally stable psychological traits, moderate anxiety alongside high self-esteem, and healthy behavioral patterns. Their physiological data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm with sufficient sleep duration, although with some variability in sleep timing. The PSS score for this participant is 22.0, which falls at the 50th percentile of the study population (Population PSS Median: 22.0).

Self-esteem is at a high level for the participant (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score: 0.26), aligning with a positive self-perception. Happiness is reported at a lower than average level (Happy Z-score: -0.53), suggesting a potential disconnect between self-esteem and current emotional state. Subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.13), a finding that may be exacerbated by objective sleep patterns. Notably, the participant exhibits a low self-reported trust in others (Trust Z-score: 0.18) and satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.05).

Behaviorally, this participant reports no substance usage across all categories. Exercise frequency is limited to 1-2 times a month for solo and group activities, with no engagement in sports. Daily recreational habits are also characterized by relatively low engagement, with the exception of listening to music (Z-score: 0.67). Time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, socializing with friends, and reading are all below average or absent. Internet usage is moderate (31 minutes an hour), and sedentary hobbies are limited. This profile suggests a lifestyle that is not characterized by high levels of physical activity or extensive social engagement.

Wearable data reveals significant deviations from population norms in circadian rhythm and sleep regulation. The participant exhibits notably low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.79), indicating poor regularity in daily activity patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.39), suggesting more frequent fluctuations in activity within the day. The mesor (average daily heart rate) is below the population average (Z-score: -1.0), as is the amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-score: -1.48), suggesting a blunted daily cardiovascular cycle. The resting heart rate is also below average (Z-score: -0.32). Aggregated hourly heart rate data shows pronounced deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z-score: 1.16, 4-5 AM Z-score: 1.33, 5-6 AM Z-score: 0.64), which could reflect an irregular sleep-wake cycle. Objective sleep statistics highlight a significantly reduced median sleep duration (5 hours 27 minutes, Z-score: -2.16) and considerably higher variability in both sleep duration (Z-score: 5.88) and sleep start time (Z-score: 7.44). The average number of daily naps is also elevated (Z-score: 1.27). These objective sleep metrics are in line with the subjective report of disturbed sleep quality and suggest a substantial disruption in sleep patterns and circadian alignment.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, scores for depressive symptoms and anxiety are near average, and self-esteem is high, which might suggest a more resilient individual. However, several factors point towards elevated stress levels. The significantly disrupted objective and subjective sleep patterns, including very short sleep duration and high variability in sleep timing, are strong indicators of physiological dysregulation often associated with stress. The low interdaily stability and autocorrelation of heart rate suggest a lack of routine and potentially difficulty managing daily demands. Furthermore, low self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, coupled with a lack of engagement in stress-mitigating activities like regular exercise and social interaction, could contribute to higher perceived stress. The elevated deviation in heart rate during early morning hours, a period typically associated with sleep, could reflect physiological arousal during a period of rest, further indicating stress. Considering the profound objective sleep disturbances and the lack of stabilizing behaviors, it is likely that this participant experiences a higher level of perceived stress. Therefore, their Perceived Stress Scale score would likely place them in the top 50% of the study population.

79395,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents with a complex profile that warrants a multimodal interpretation of their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicate elevated levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, with STAI scores indicating chronic anxiety proneness (Z-score 1.25) and CES-D scores suggesting a significant burden of depressive symptoms (Z-score 1.95). These psychological indicators are positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that higher anxiety and depressive symptomology contribute to increased perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively low (Z-score -1.85) and happiness is also reported at a lower level (Z-score -1.61), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that a lack of self-worth and lower happiness contribute to higher perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also moderately low (Z-score -0.86), aligning with a potentially higher stress profile.

Behavioral patterns reveal a mixed picture. The participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor usage of 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), which is positively correlated with perceived stress for wine or liquor. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all,"" with low Z-scores, indicating minimal use of these substances. Exercise habits include exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score 1.23), which is negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that social exercise may be a stress buffer. However, solitary exercise frequency is lower (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.32). Daily recreational habits include considerable time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64) and listening to music (Z-score 0.21), while reading and playing video games are notably absent or infrequent. These sedentary habits, particularly watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies, show a slight positive correlation with perceived stress.

Wearable data provides objective physiological and behavioral rhythm insights. The participant exhibits a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.16) and a moderately low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.53), with a strong Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.15). These metrics suggest a structured daily pattern, which is generally associated with lower stress, and are negatively correlated with perceived stress. The Mesor (average heart rate) is within the population norm (Z-score -0.23), and the Amplitude of heart rate variation is also typical (Z-score 0.04). Resting heart rate is also within the expected range (Z-score -0.17). However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals notable deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late evening and early morning hours. Specifically, significant negative deviations are observed between 3-4 AM (-17.91), 4-5 AM (-18.98), and 5-6 AM (-21.76), suggesting a period of marked physiological hypoarousal during these times. Conversely, there are periods of increased physiological arousal in the late evening, with positive deviations between 9-10 PM (14.4) and 10-11 PM (14.43). These patterns, especially the late-night elevations, are positively correlated with perceived stress. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score 0.09), which is close to average, and a standard deviation in sleep duration that is slightly lower than average (Z-score -0.29). The median sleep start time is very late (01:21:45), and the standard deviation for sleep start time is also relatively low (Z-score -0.8), suggesting a consistent but late sleep schedule, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant exhibits several indicators associated with higher perceived stress. The significant levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, are strong predictors of elevated stress. While some behavioral and physiological rhythms are indicative of regularity (high interdaily stability, autocorrelation), the pronounced late-evening physiological arousal and extremely late sleep onset time, along with their positive correlation with perceived stress, suggest potential disruption and strain. The consumption of alcohol, particularly wine or liquor, also aligns with this pattern. Despite some positive buffering factors such as social exercise, the cumulative psychological and physiological markers point towards a higher stress burden.

Based on the available data and the analysis of various psychological and behavioral indicators, this participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), is likely to place them in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution. The elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem, late sleep onset, and physiological arousal patterns observed in the late evening contribute to this assessment.

59863,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a range of psychological and behavioral characteristics that inform an understanding of their perceived stress. On self-report measures, the individual reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.86) and anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.71), suggesting a generally stable emotional baseline. Self-esteem is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.66, indicating a strong sense of self-worth. Similarly, self-reported happiness is also elevated (Z-score of 1.64). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.8, and a low PSQI score further supports this. Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z-score of 1.3). Regarding lifestyle, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, consuming beer 1-2 times per week, but abstains from wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are regular, with solo exercise three times a week or more, and some participation in sports and exercising with others. Daily recreational activities include moderate amounts of television watching and internet usage, alongside substantial time spent listening to music and socializing with friends. Notably, the participant dedicates a considerable amount of time to reading (16-30 minutes), which correlates negatively with perceived stress.

Analysis of wearable-derived data reveals specific physiological and behavioral patterns. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a higher-than-average mesor (circadian rhythm amplitude index) with a Z-score of 2.36, suggesting a potentially more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the population. The amplitude of this rhythm is also elevated (Z-score of 1.01), further supporting this observation. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:23 PM). Interdaily stability of heart rate, a measure of daily regularity, is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.42), while intradaily variability, reflecting fluctuations within a day, is lower than average (Z-score of -1.16), suggesting a more consistent daily pattern of physiological activity. Resting heart rate is also elevated (Z-score of 1.13), which could be indicative of a higher baseline physiological arousal. Examining the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a general pattern of elevated heart rate during waking hours, particularly from approximately 8 AM to 8 PM, with the most significant positive deviations observed during mid-morning and afternoon. Conversely, the late-night and early-morning hours (1 AM to 7 AM) show the most substantial negative deviations from the mesor, aligning with expected physiological rest. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes, which is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.27). The variability in sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score of -0.69), suggesting more consistent nightly sleep lengths. The median sleep start time is around 12:38 AM, with moderate variability (Z-score of -0.21). No daily naps were recorded.

Considering the participant's data in relation to the population PSS scores, several factors suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level. The participant exhibits strong indicators of psychological well-being, including low levels of anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, and high self-reported happiness, all of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Their subjective sleep quality is also classified as good. Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise and a balanced approach to recreational activities, further contribute to a picture of lower stress. The relatively stable circadian rhythm metrics (moderate interdaily stability, low intradaily variability) and the consistent sleep duration also point towards better stress management. While the mesor and amplitude of heart rate are elevated, suggesting a higher physiological arousal, the negative correlations of several positive psychological and behavioral traits with PSS score are more direct indicators. Given the strength of these positive indicators and the general absence of significant negative findings related to stress, it is plausible that this participant's perceived stress level falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

This participant presents with a psychological profile characterized by generally low levels of self-reported depression (CESD Z-score: -1.38) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72). Self-esteem is within the average range (RSES Z-score: -0.03), and general happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Trust in others is also near the population mean (Trust Z-score: -0.14). Health satisfaction is also close to average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.05).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, which are above the population average. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency is low, with exercising alone and with others occurring 1-2 times a month, and no participation in sports. Daily recreational habits indicate limited engagement with activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and socializing with friends, with significant portions of time spent in these activities below the population average. Notably, activities like reading, listening to music, and engaging in sedentary hobbies show time commitments that are either minimal or absent, suggesting a potential deficit in dedicated leisure or restorative activities.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a higher than average Mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint of heart rate), indicating a generally elevated baseline heart rate compared to the study population (Mesor Z-score: 1.81). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also above average (Amplitude Z-score: 0.84), suggesting a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon (4:49 PM). The mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor highlights periods of elevated heart rate during typical waking hours, particularly in the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM). Conversely, during nighttime hours, heart rate deviations are generally lower than the Mesor, as expected. Sleep duration is notably longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.79), and the sleep start time is consistently late, with a median start time of 11:55 PM. The standard deviation for both sleep duration and start time are close to the population average, suggesting relative consistency in sleep patterns. Intraday variability in heart rate is significantly lower than the population average (Intraday Variability Z-score: -1.8), which, combined with a near-average Interdaily Stability, suggests a highly regular but potentially less responsive cardiovascular system throughout the day.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's data provides several indicators relevant to their perceived stress level. On the positive side, self-reported depression and anxiety are low, and self-esteem is average, which typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Health satisfaction and trust in others are also near average. However, several factors suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. The increased consumption of alcohol (beer and wine/liquor), while not extreme, is above average and can be an indicator of coping mechanisms. The significantly lower intraday variability in heart rate, coupled with an elevated Mesor and Amplitude, could suggest a physiologically strained system, though this needs careful interpretation in context. Furthermore, the participant's reported sleep duration is notably longer than average, which, in conjunction with a late sleep start time, may indicate a disrupted circadian rhythm or a tendency towards sleep as a refuge, sometimes associated with higher stress.

The correlations between PSS score and some of these metrics are also informative. While the correlations are not overwhelmingly strong for any single metric, several are in a direction that might suggest higher stress. For example, a positive correlation with STAI (anxiety) of 0.31, and a positive correlation with Intraday Variability of 0.16, could indicate that higher PSS scores are associated with these factors. Conversely, negative correlations with Self-Esteem (-0.15) and Happiness (-0.19) suggest that lower levels of these traits might be associated with higher PSS, which aligns with general expectations. The positive correlation with Resting Heart Rate (0.14) is also noteworthy, suggesting that a higher resting heart rate might be associated with higher perceived stress.

Considering the available evidence, the elevated Mesor and Amplitude of heart rate, along with increased alcohol consumption, and the potential implications of a very long sleep duration with a late start time, suggest that this participant may be experiencing stress that is not fully captured by their low self-reported anxiety and depression scores. These physiological and behavioral patterns, even in the presence of positive psychological traits, can contribute to a higher overall stress burden. Therefore, it is plausible that this participant falls within the top 50th percentile for perceived stress, indicating a relatively elevated level compared to the study population.

This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral indicators, potentially influenced by varying levels of perceived stress. Notably, self-reported measures indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = 2.99) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.75). These elevated scores are associated with a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress, suggesting that individuals experiencing higher levels of anxiety and depression may also report greater perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be relatively lower than the study population (SelfEsteem Z-score = -2.28), and this is weakly associated with lower perceived stress, implying that higher self-esteem might be protective against perceived stress. Happiness levels are also below the average for the study population (Happy Z-score = -1.61), with a moderate negative correlation to perceived stress, indicating that reduced happiness may be linked to increased perceived stress.

Lifestyle behaviors further illuminate this participant's daily functioning. A high PSQI score (Z-score = 2.9) points to significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality, which correlates positively with perceived stress. This is accompanied by substantial engagement in sedentary activities, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 3.17), playing video games (Z-score = 4.74), and extensive internet usage (Z-score = 2.19), all of which show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress. Notably, this participant reports minimal socializing with friends (Z-score = -2.2), limited reading (Z-score = -0.67), and no sedentary hobbies. While exercise frequency is somewhat above average for exercising alone (Z-score = 1.07), exercising with others is significantly below average (Z-score = -1.58).

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a resting heart rate that is higher than the average for the study population (Z-score = 1.24), with a moderate positive correlation to perceived stress. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm overall, as suggested by the moderate Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -0.08) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -0.32). However, the acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:06 PM). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-8 AM, with deviations ranging from -16.09 to -11.19 relative to the mesor), with stronger positive correlations to perceived stress observed in these hours, particularly 4-5 AM and 5-6 AM. Conversely, heart rate deviations are generally lower during the late evening and early morning (12 AM - 2 AM) and during midday hours (12 PM - 3 PM), with several of these periods showing negative correlations with perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported data indicates significant levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with poor subjective sleep quality and lower-than-average happiness. These factors are generally associated with higher perceived stress. While self-esteem is low, it's negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting it might offer some buffer. The extensive engagement in sedentary leisure activities, particularly screen time, and limited social interaction also align with patterns that may contribute to elevated perceived stress.

Physiologically, the higher resting heart rate and the observed patterns of increased heart rate deviation during sleep, particularly in the early morning hours, are notable and show positive correlations with perceived stress. While overall circadian rhythm stability is moderate, the specific timing of elevated physiological arousal during sleep could be indicative of stress impacting restorative processes.

Considering the strong presence of multiple indicators associated with higher perceived stress, including significant mental health symptoms, poor sleep quality, and specific behavioral patterns, it is likely that this participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top 50% of the study population distribution. The presence of clinically significant depressive and anxious symptoms, alongside disturbed sleep, strongly suggests a heightened stress experience.

Self-report measures reveal elevated levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a high STAI score (Z=1.85) and a CES-D score indicating a substantial burden of depressive symptoms (Z=1.42). Conversely, self-esteem is below average (Z=-1.29). Sleep quality is significantly disturbed, as indicated by a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z=1.98), placing them in the 'Disturbed Sleep' classification and suggesting a substantial discrepancy between their subjective experience and objective sleep metrics. Daily activities are characterized by extensive internet usage (Z=0.85), prolonged listening to music (Z=1.6), and significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z=0.64). Notably, there is a complete lack of engagement in exercise, including individual workouts, group workouts, and sports (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93).

Wearable data further illuminate potential physiological correlates of stress. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated (Z=1.55) compared to the study population. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a higher than average Mesor (Value=79.9, Z=0.81), suggesting a generally higher baseline heart rate. However, the Amplitude is lower than average (Z=-1.19), which, in conjunction with the higher Mesor, may suggest a less dynamic circadian rhythm. Intradaily variability is also higher than average (Z=0.67), indicating more fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals consistent patterns of elevated heart rate during typical waking hours, particularly in the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 12-1pm, 1-2pm, 3-4pm, 4-5pm). Conversely, there are notable dips in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am, 4-5am, 5-6am), coinciding with periods of low activity and likely sleep. Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Z=1.37) and a significantly higher variability in sleep duration (Z=1.73). The median sleep start time is notably late (02:58:00), and there is also considerable variability in sleep start times (Z=-0.66). The high frequency of naps (Z=1.34) further suggests potential disruptions in the sleep-wake cycle.

The confluence of high anxiety and depressive symptom scores, significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality, low engagement in physical activity, and physiological patterns including elevated resting heart rate and disrupted sleep/activity rhythms strongly suggests that this participant is experiencing elevated levels of perceived stress. The correlations, while not definitive on their own, generally align with this interpretation; for instance, positive correlations with anxiety (0.31) and depressive symptoms (0.28) and a negative correlation with self-esteem (-0.15) are consistent with higher perceived stress. The data collectively paints a picture of an individual struggling with psychological well-being and exhibiting behaviors and physiological responses indicative of significant stress. Considering the overall pattern of elevated distress indicators, this participant is likely to fall within the top 50% of the study population for perceived stress.

64296,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate relatively low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.07) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score of -0.62). Furthermore, their self-esteem is within the upper range of the normative distribution for this study (SelfEsteem Z-score of 0.96), and they report high current happiness (Happy Z-score of 1.64). Health satisfaction also appears to be favorable (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -0.78). However, a notably high score in happiness, coupled with a strong positive Z-score, might indicate a tendency towards positive affect that could mask underlying stress, or it could reflect genuine well-being. Trust levels are moderate (Trust Z-score of 0.5).

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a low engagement in most substance usage, with no reported use of beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits are minimal, with no reported solitary exercise and infrequent exercise with others (1-2 times a week), and no participation in sports. Daily recreation habits are characterized by low engagement in most activities, with the exception of video games, internet usage, and socializing with friends, which are limited to 15-30 minutes daily. This pattern suggests a generally sedentary lifestyle with limited structured physical activity or extensive recreational pursuits. The PSQI score of 5.0 suggests potentially problematic sleep quality, though this is not a high score in absolute terms, and its Z-score indicates it is below the population average for poorer sleep.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal notable patterns in circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The participant's interdaily stability is high (Z-score of 1.41), suggesting a regular daily routine in terms of activity and rest, which is further supported by a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.32). Conversely, intradaily variability is relatively low (Z-score of -0.25), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, potentially reflecting a stable but perhaps less dynamic physiological state. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score of 2.7), suggesting a significant difference between their peak and trough heart rates, which could be indicative of a pronounced diurnal rhythm or heightened physiological response to stimuli. Their mesor (average heart rate) is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.34). The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:23 PM. Their resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-score of -0.99), which can be indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of reduced heart rate during early morning hours (significant negative deviations from 1 AM to 8 AM), followed by an increase during late morning and afternoon, peaking around 4-5 PM, which aligns with the acrophase. This pattern is consistent with a typical diurnal physiological cycle but with an unusually pronounced dip in the early morning hours and a strong elevation in the late afternoon.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes, which is slightly below average for the population (Z-score of -0.4), and a below-average standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of -1.33), suggesting relatively consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is around 1:07 AM, with a moderate standard deviation (Z-score of -0.72), indicating some regularity but not strict adherence to a consistent sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps and a low mean daily nap value are noted.

Considering the data holistically, the participant presents with generally low self-reported psychological distress and a tendency towards a sedentary lifestyle with limited social engagement. However, the notably high amplitude in their heart rate rhythm and the pronounced diurnal heart rate variations, particularly the deep dips in the early morning and peaks in the late afternoon, warrant attention. While their resting heart rate is low, the high amplitude could reflect greater physiological reactivity. The moderate sleep duration, while consistent, is not optimal. The correlations provided offer some guidance: a positive correlation between CES-D and PSS score (0.28) and STAI and PSS score (0.31) suggest that higher levels of depression and anxiety would be associated with higher perceived stress. The negative correlation between Self-Esteem and PSS score (-0.15) suggests that lower self-esteem might be linked to higher stress. Happiness has a moderate negative correlation (-0.19), implying greater happiness might correlate with lower stress. Similarly, health satisfaction and trust show weak negative correlations with PSS.

Interdaily stability shows a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.11), suggesting higher stability might be linked to lower stress. Intradaily variability has a weak positive correlation (0.16), suggesting higher variability might be linked to higher stress. The amplitude shows a moderate negative correlation (-0.16), implying higher amplitude might be linked to lower stress, which contrasts with a potential interpretation of physiological reactivity. Sleep duration standard deviation shows a weak positive correlation (0.14), suggesting greater variability in sleep duration could be linked to higher stress.

The participant's profile is mixed. They present with low psychological distress indicators and good self-esteem, which would typically point towards lower perceived stress. However, the pronounced physiological rhythms and moderate sleep duration are potential contributors to stress. Given the average PSS score for the population falls around 22, and this participant reports low scores on direct measures of anxiety and depression, their perceived stress is likely not exceptionally high. The strong positive correlations between anxiety/depression and PSS, and the negative correlations with happiness and self-esteem suggest that if these were elevated, PSS would increase. As they are currently low, it suggests lower PSS. The amplitude's negative correlation with PSS is intriguing, as higher amplitude might be interpreted as increased stress, yet it's correlated with lower PSS. This suggests that for this participant, the robust diurnal rhythm is not necessarily a marker of high stress.

Considering the generally low scores on direct measures of distress (CES-D, STAI), good self-esteem, and high happiness, coupled with relatively healthy habits (no substance use), it is reasonable to infer that the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely not in the top half of the study population. The physiological data, while showing pronounced rhythms, does not definitively indicate heightened stress in conjunction with the self-report data.

17569,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several indicators suggesting potential areas of concern related to well-being and stress. Their self-reported mental health status indicates low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.24) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -0.33), which are within the non-clinical range. Notably, their self-esteem is relatively high (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.68), aligning with a generally positive self-perception. However, their subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.59), falling above the commonly recognized threshold for significant sleep issues. This is further corroborated by their objectively measured sleep duration, which is substantially lower than the study population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -1.81), indicating consistently insufficient sleep. The participant also reports lower-than-average levels of happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53). In terms of lifestyle behaviors, there is a notable pattern of limited engagement in physical activity, with ""Exercised Alone"" at a very low frequency (Z-score: -1.93) and ""Sports"" also infrequently engaged in (Z-score: -1.09). Conversely, they report moderate engagement in social activities with friends (Socializing with Friends Z-score: 0.16). Alcohol consumption, specifically beer, is at a higher frequency than the average participant (Beer Usage Z-score: 1.01).

The analysis of wearable-derived physiological data reveals a highly irregular circadian rhythm, evidenced by a low interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 1.16). This suggests a lack of consistent daily patterning in their physiological activity. While their mean heart rate (Mesor) is below the population average (Mesor Z-score: -0.65), their resting heart rate is particularly low (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.33), which could be indicative of a good baseline fitness or, in the context of other findings, a potential sign of physiological dysregulation. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the Mesor during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2 AM and 6 AM, where deviations are notably negative (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score: -1.72, 3-4 AM Z-score: -2.02, 4-5 AM Z-score: -1.97, 5-6 AM Z-score: -1.97). These prolonged periods of suppressed heart rate during these hours, coinciding with their reported late sleep start times and short sleep durations, strongly suggest a severely disrupted sleep-wake cycle and potential sleep deprivation. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurring in the mid-afternoon (4:14 PM) is consistent with a somewhat delayed circadian phase, further contributing to the observed irregularity. The high amplitude of their heart rate rhythm (Amplitude Z-score: 0.91) may reflect significant physiological fluctuations, which, in conjunction with the low stability and early morning heart rate suppression, could be indicative of a physiological system under strain.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), would likely place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution. This conclusion is supported by a confluence of factors, primarily the objectively measured insufficient sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -1.81), which is a strong predictor of elevated stress. The disturbed sleep quality indicated by the PSQI (Z-score: 0.59) and the highly irregular circadian rhythm with significant early morning heart rate suppression further point to physiological strain that is often associated with higher stress levels. While self-reported anxiety and depression are within the normative range, the low reported happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53) and the significant lack of engagement in solitary exercise (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.93) suggest a potential deficit in stress-coping mechanisms or engagement in restorative activities. The higher-than-average beer consumption (Beer Usage Z-score: 1.01) might also be an indicator of self-medication or an attempt to cope with discomfort. Despite positive self-esteem, the combination of sleep disturbance, circadian dysregulation, and reduced engagement in health-promoting behaviors strongly suggests a higher burden of perceived stress.

Exercise frequency is limited, particularly for solo or group exercise, though participation in sports is at a moderate level (1-2 times a week), which has a slight negative correlation with perceived stress. Recreational activities are largely absent, with no time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, listening to music, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. Internet usage is low (16-30 minutes), and social interaction with friends is also notably limited (16-30 minutes), with both exhibiting weak positive correlations with perceived stress. Reading is also not a current habit.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics suggest a somewhat regular sleep-wake cycle, as evidenced by a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-Score 2.49), indicating good day-to-day predictability in heart rate patterns. However, intradaily variability in heart rate is low (Z-Score -1.31), suggesting a less dynamic cardiovascular response throughout the day, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated above the population average (Z-Score 0.62), with a moderate resting heart rate (Z-Score 0.36). The Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor data reveals a pattern of lower than average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours, gradually increasing throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon and early evening. Notably, the lowest deviations occur between 2-6 AM, and the highest deviations, representing periods of higher cardiovascular activity relative to the mesor, are observed between 2 PM and 10 PM.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-Score -0.41) and negatively correlated with perceived stress. Sleep onset time is also relatively late, with a median start time of 00:47:30, and there is some variability in sleep duration and start time. Naps are not a regular occurrence. The PSQI score of 6.0 classifies as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" suggesting subjective concerns about sleep quality despite the wearable data.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's data presents a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. On one hand, the presence of ""anxious"" classification on the STAI, lower-than-average health satisfaction, and disturbed sleep quality (PSQI) suggest potential contributors to elevated stress. The limited engagement in beneficial activities like exercise and socializing, coupled with very low internet usage and sedentary hobby engagement, might indicate a lack of stress-mitigating outlets.

Conversely, the participant exhibits good self-esteem, above-average happiness, and minimal substance use, all of which are typically associated with lower perceived stress. The physiological data shows a relatively stable circadian rhythm with good autocorrelation, and while sleep duration is slightly reduced, it is not drastically so. The low intradaily variability in heart rate, though potentially indicative of lower cardiovascular responsiveness, is negatively correlated with perceived stress. The positive correlations of some potentially stress-elevating factors (e.g., internet usage, socializing with friends) with perceived stress are weak.

Considering the population's PSS distribution, where the median is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, and the mean is 21.61 with a standard deviation of 3.68, the participant's profile does not strongly point towards exceptionally high stress. The positive indicators like higher happiness and good self-esteem, alongside the absence of significant depressive symptoms and moderate levels of anxiety, suggest that their overall perceived stress level is likely not in the top 50% of the distribution. The slightly reduced sleep duration and disturbed sleep quality are concerning but do not, in isolation, outweigh the mitigating factors. Therefore, the participant's perceived stress is more likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population.

82986,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant presents a complex profile of self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle habits, and objectively measured physiological and behavioral data. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.97) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score of -1.61), suggesting a relatively stable psychological baseline in these areas. Conversely, self-esteem is reported at a level significantly above the population mean (SelfEsteem Z-score of 1.66), indicating a strong sense of self-worth. Happiness is also reported at a higher than average level (Happy Z-score of 1.64). These positive self-perceptions are accompanied by a high level of trust in others (Trust Z-score of 1.79). Health satisfaction, however, is only slightly above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 0.8).

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports no substance usage (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all with negative Z-scores indicating low usage). Exercise habits include moderate solitary exercise (Exercised Alone Frequency Z-score of 0.32) but infrequent exercise with others or participation in sports (Exercised with Others Z-score of -0.17, Sports Frequency Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational activities are notably sparse; the participant reports abstaining from watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music (all with negative Z-scores). Internet usage is at a moderate level (Internet Usage Z-score of -0.49), while socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (Socializing with Friends Z-score of 0.16), suggesting a primary mode of social engagement. Reading and other sedentary hobbies are also infrequent.

Physiological data reveal a distinct pattern in circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The participant's sleep duration is significantly below the population average, with a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 6 minutes (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of -2.6), indicating substantial sleep deprivation. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also relatively low (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.75), suggesting consistent but insufficient sleep. The median sleep start time is very late (02:24:00), with a standard deviation that indicates some variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.48). The circadian rhythm analysis shows a lower than average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.66), suggesting less regularity in daily patterns, and a higher than average intraday variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score of 0.46), indicative of more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Amplitude Z-score of -1.04), suggesting a less pronounced daily cycle in physiological activity. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly elevated compared to the population (Mesor Z-score of 0.79), and resting heart rate is also higher than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 1.03).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM), potentially reflecting deep sleep stages or an unusual pattern of physiological activity during that period. Notably, heart rate elevates significantly above the mesor during typical waking hours, particularly from 7 AM onwards, peaking around 8-9 AM. A secondary, less pronounced elevation is observed in the late evening (10-11 PM). The acrophase, the time of day when the peak heart rate occurs, is recorded at 4:37 PM, which is later than typical and deviates from the observed morning peak in elevated heart rate deviations. The low correlation coefficients between most individual metrics and PSS scores suggest that while these behaviors and physiological patterns exist, they may not be direct linear predictors of perceived stress in this dataset.

Given the constellation of data, particularly the significantly reduced sleep duration, the lower interdaily stability in circadian rhythms, and the elevated resting heart rate, these factors may contribute to heightened physiological stress, even in the presence of favorable self-reported psychological markers. The absence of substance use and a generally low level of certain recreational activities, coupled with the late sleep onset and high heart rate during waking hours, paints a picture of a potentially stressful lifestyle, possibly exacerbated by academic demands. The strong self-reported positive psychological traits could be buffering the subjective experience of stress, or the physiological indicators might reflect an underlying strain not fully captured by self-report.

Based on the available data, the participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a higher perceived stress level. The most prominent is the critically low median sleep duration (5 hours 6 minutes, Z-score of -2.6), which is a well-established contributor to elevated stress. Additionally, the lower interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score of -0.66) and higher intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.46) suggest a less regulated daily physiological rhythm, often associated with increased stress. While the participant reports low anxiety and depression, and high self-esteem and happiness, these subjective measures may not fully capture the physiological load imposed by insufficient sleep and disrupted circadian patterns. The elevated resting heart rate (Z-score of 1.03) also points towards a higher physiological arousal state. Despite positive self-perceptions, the physiological strain indicated by sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm disruptions likely places this participant in the upper half of the distribution for perceived stress, as these objective measures often correlate with a greater subjective experience of stress that may not be fully reflected in trait measures.

11402,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that warrant consideration when evaluating perceived stress. Self-reported anxiety is notably elevated, with a STAI-Trait score of 54.0, placing them at 1.25 standard deviations above the mean, and a positive correlation (0.31) with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This suggests a disposition towards chronic anxiety, which is a known contributor to heightened stress perception. Concurrently, depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are also present with a score of 17.0, aligning with a classification of ""Depressed"" and exhibiting a moderate positive correlation (0.28) with PSS. While self-esteem is at the upper limit of the scale (40.0), indicating high self-worth, this is accompanied by a negative correlation (-0.15) with PSS, suggesting that high self-esteem does not buffer against stress in this individual. Health satisfaction is reported as average (-0.53 Z-score), and trust in others is relatively high (1.15 Z-score), with weak negative correlations to PSS, indicating these factors are unlikely to be primary drivers of perceived stress.

Lifestyle habits present a mixed picture. The participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (1.01 Z-score), while wine/liquor use is less frequent. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are notably absent. Exercise habits are somewhat limited, with the participant exercising alone or with others 1-2 times a week, but not engaging in sports. This is in contrast to sedentary activities, where significant time is spent watching TV/videos/movies (1.28 Z-score) and playing video games (2.47 Z-score), indicating a preference for more passive forms of leisure. Internet usage is also substantial (0.85 Z-score). Reading habits are minimal, with a negative correlation (-0.21) to PSS.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals an elevated Mesor (83.48, 1.3 Z-score), suggesting a generally higher baseline heart rate compared to the study population. The aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates significant deviations from this baseline, particularly during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM with negative deviations up to -20.56 and positive deviations around midnight up to 5.92). These patterns, along with a higher resting heart rate (63.4, 0.62 Z-score), suggest a potentially heightened physiological arousal, especially during sleep initiation and early morning. Circadian rhythm metrics are largely within expected ranges, though the Interdaily Stability (0.37, -0.33 Z-score) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.2, -1.03 Z-score) suggest some irregularity in the daily rhythm. Sleep duration is below average, with a median of 6 hours and 19 minutes (-1.07 Z-score), and the sleep start time is notably late (median 03:17:50), with high variability in both duration and start time. This fragmented and delayed sleep pattern, coupled with elevated physiological arousal during the night, may contribute to increased perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score needs to be evaluated in the context of the population distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.62, with a 50th percentile (median) of 22.0. Evidence for a high PSS score comes from several indicators. The elevated STAI-Trait score (54.0, 1.25 Z-score) signifying chronic anxiety, a known correlate of high stress, suggests a predisposition towards elevated stress levels. The presence of moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D score 17.0) also aligns with higher stress perception. Physiologically, the elevated Mesor (83.48, 1.3 Z-score) and resting heart rate (63.4, 0.62 Z-score) suggest a generally heightened physiological state. Furthermore, the disrupted sleep patterns, with below-average sleep duration (6 hours 19 minutes, -1.07 Z-score) and a very late, variable sleep start time, are commonly associated with increased stress. The significant negative deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., -20.56 at 6-7 AM) and substantial deviations from the mesor at other times indicate a potentially stressed cardiovascular system.

Conversely, evidence for a low or median PSS score is less pronounced. While self-esteem is high (40.0), its weak negative correlation with PSS indicates it is not acting as a significant buffer against stress. Trust in others is also relatively high, but this also shows a weak negative correlation. Health satisfaction is moderate. While some leisure activities like watching TV and playing video games are high, these are sedentary and may not contribute to stress reduction.

Considering the convergence of elevated anxiety, depressive symptoms, heightened physiological arousal indicators, and disrupted sleep patterns, the evidence strongly suggests that this participant experiences a level of perceived stress that would place them in the top half of the study population. These factors collectively point towards a more stressed psychological and physiological state, surpassing the average experience within the cohort.

38610,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by generally low levels of depressive and anxious symptoms, as indicated by their Z-scores on the CES-D (-1.07) and STAI (-1.31) scales, respectively. Their self-esteem is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.66. Similarly, self-reported happiness is also elevated (Z-score: 1.64). Trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.83). Academic performance, as reflected by GPA, is consistently strong. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score: 1.13).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in low levels of substance use, with reported usage of beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs all being less frequent than 1-2 times a month, or not at all for recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits include exercising alone 1-2 times a week and exercising with others three times a week or more, which is a relatively high frequency for the latter, with a Z-score of 1.23. They do not participate in sports. Daily recreational habits show limited engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and moderate engagement in listening to music and internet usage. Socializing with friends is reported for 16-30 minutes daily, which is a lower frequency, with a Z-score of -1.41. Reading and sedentary hobbies are also engaged in for similar durations.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a circadian rhythm with a Mesor (mean heart rate) of 82.33 bpm, which is above the population mean (Z-score: 1.14). The amplitude of the rhythm is below average (Z-score: -1.15). The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:32 PM. The data suggests a less regular sleep pattern, with a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 46 minutes, which is significantly below the population average (Z-score: -1.76). The median sleep start time is very late at 02:39:15. Intradaily variability of heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.32), while interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are below average (Z-scores: -0.33 and -0.36, respectively), indicating less consistent daily patterns. The average deviation from the mesor shows a pattern of lower heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-6 AM, with Z-scores around 0.5) and higher heart rates during the late morning and evening (e.g., 9-10 AM and 10-11 PM, with Z-scores up to 1.23 and 0.89). Resting heart rate is also elevated (Z-score: 1.14). The PSQI score of 7.0, while indicating disturbed sleep, is close to the population average (Z-score: 0.13).

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to be in the bottom 50% of the study population. This assessment is primarily based on the low scores in self-reported depressive and anxious symptoms (CES-D and STAI), alongside high self-esteem and happiness. These psychological indicators are often inversely related to perceived stress. While sleep duration is significantly reduced, and sleep onset is late, the PSQI score is only marginally above the threshold for disturbed sleep and close to the population mean, suggesting subjective sleep quality might not be as severely impacted as the objective duration suggests. Furthermore, the participant engages in regular physical activity with others and maintains strong academic performance, which are typically associated with lower stress levels. The correlations with PSS, while not definitive, largely lean towards negative associations with measures indicative of lower stress, such as happiness, exercise with others, and self-esteem, and positive associations with measures indicative of higher stress, such as shorter sleep duration. The observed physiological patterns, such as elevated resting heart rate and Mesor, coupled with reduced sleep duration, could suggest some physiological strain. However, the absence of significant psychological distress markers and the presence of protective behavioral factors (social exercise) and positive psychological traits (high self-esteem, happiness) suggest that these physiological deviations may not translate to a high overall perceived stress score in this individual.

96610,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm metrics for a university student. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the central metric for evaluation.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits several psychological traits and behavioral patterns that may inform their perceived stress levels. Notably, their STAI-Trait score is low (-1.61 Z-score), suggesting a predisposition towards low chronic anxiety, and they report not being depressed (CES-D Z-score of -1.18). This indicates a generally stable psychological baseline. Conversely, self-esteem (RSES Z-score of 1.66) and happiness (Z-score of 1.64) are reported at a higher than average level, which might offer some resilience against stress. Health satisfaction is also notably high (Z-score of 2.05).

In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports engaging in sports once or twice a week (Z-score of 0.91), a higher frequency compared to exercising alone (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score -1.18) or with others (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.17). Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for beer, wine or liquor, and recreational drugs, aligning with lower prevalence. Daily recreational habits show low engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25) and video games (Z-score -0.56), with moderate internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.16). Notably, the participant reports minimal time spent listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.72) and socializing with friends (31 minutes to an hour, Z-score -0.62). Reading and sedentary hobbies are reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-scores -0.21 and -0.05 respectively).

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score 0.32). Their circadian rhythm analysis reveals a relatively stable day-to-day rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.83), but with moderate intraday variability (Z-score -0.25). The Mesor, representing the average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle, is higher than average (Z-score 0.92), and the amplitude, indicating the extent of daily variation, is also elevated (Z-score 1.03). The acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is reported as 4:20 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates elevated cardiovascular activity during mid-afternoon hours (e.g., 2-3 PM with a Z-score of 1.42, and 3-4 PM with a Z-score of 1.35), and to a lesser extent in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 6-7 PM with a Z-score of 0.52). Conversely, heart rates are notably lower than expected during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM with a Z-score of -1.19, and 2-3 AM with a Z-score of -1.13).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes (Z-score -0.37), which is slightly below average. The standard deviation of sleep duration is within the normal range (Z-score -0.1). The median sleep start time is late, at 1:21 AM (Z-score -0.77 for standard deviation of start time suggests some regularity), and the mean daily naps are low (Z-score 0.44). The PSQI score of 8.0, with a Z-score of 0.59, suggests disturbed sleep, falling into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification.

Correlations with PSS score, while informative, should be considered alongside the holistic interpretation. Several factors show weak negative correlations with PSS, such as self-esteem (-0.15), happiness (-0.19), reading time (-0.21), and exercise with others (-0.02). Positive correlations, though generally weak, are observed with variables like CES-D (0.28) and STAI (0.31), indicating a tendency for higher depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness to be associated with higher perceived stress, as expected.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's self-reported psychological state, characterized by low anxiety proneness, absence of depressive symptoms, and high self-esteem and happiness, suggests a potential for lower perceived stress. However, several behavioral and physiological factors warrant consideration. The PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep, and the median sleep duration is below average, which are known contributors to elevated stress. Furthermore, the elevated Mesor and Amplitude of heart rate, coupled with increased cardiovascular activity during afternoon and early evening hours, could reflect underlying physiological strain. While the participant engages in sports, their social interaction and recreational habits appear limited.

Considering the population PSS distribution, where the median is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, a score below 22.0 would place them in the bottom 50%. Given the presence of disturbed sleep and elevated physiological arousal patterns, alongside limited social and recreational engagement, these factors may contribute to an increase in perceived stress, potentially counteracting the resilience offered by their positive psychological traits. The correlations, while not overriding, also show positive associations between PSS and indicators of psychological distress.

Holistically, the interplay of disturbed sleep, physiological indicators of arousal, and less engaged social/recreational patterns suggest that while the participant possesses some protective psychological factors, the overall evidence leans towards a PSS score that is not definitively in the lower half of the distribution. The elevated Mesor and Amplitude, along with the afternoon/evening heart rate deviations, are particularly indicative of a system under some level of persistent physiological demand. Therefore, it is more probable that their PSS score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

77711,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile characterized by elevated anxiety, a strong tendency to engage in sedentary recreational activities, and a generally regular but potentially disrupted sleep pattern. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 52.0 places the participant in the 'anxious' classification with a Z-score of 1.06, indicating higher than average chronic anxiety within the study population. This psychological disposition is weakly correlated with perceived stress (0.32). Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.55), but this is negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.19). Interestingly, the participant reports very low levels of recreational and non-prescribed drug use, and moderate substance usage of beer and wine or liquor, all with negligible correlations to perceived stress.

Behaviorally, this participant demonstrates a notable preference for passive entertainment, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' (1-2 hours daily, Z-score = 1.28) and 'Listening to Music' (3-4 hours daily, Z-score = 1.6) being significantly higher than population averages. Conversely, 'Video Games' and 'Reading' are either not engaged in or engaged in minimally, with negative Z-scores for time spent. Sports participation is infrequent. While overall 'Interdaily Stability' in heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.57), suggesting some irregularity in daily rhythm, 'Intradaily Variability' is also slightly below average (Z-score = -0.25), implying that heart rate fluctuations throughout the day are not excessively high. The 'Mesor' of heart rate is lower than average (Z-score = -0.7), and 'Resting Heart Rate' is also low (Z-score = -0.68), which could indicate a generally lower physiological arousal state. The 'Acrophase' (peak heart rate time) is reported as 3:28 PM.

Sleep patterns, as indicated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, suggest 'Disturbed Sleep' (Z-score = 0.13). While the median sleep duration is slightly less than optimal at 6 hours and 55 minutes (Z-score = -0.33), the standard deviation for sleep duration is notably low (Z-score = -0.7), suggesting consistency in sleep duration. The median sleep start time is very late (01:02:30 AM), and the standard deviation for this start time is also low (Z-score = -0.62), indicating a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps is consistent with population norms. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals several periods of notable deviation from the mesor. Specifically, the hours between 1 AM and 6 AM show significant negative deviations (e.g., -19.68 at 4-5 AM), indicating lower than average heart rate during these late-night/early-morning hours, potentially reflecting deep sleep. Conversely, during the daytime and early evening, there are several hours with positive deviations, most notably between 1 PM and 3 PM (up to 17.81 at 1-2 PM), suggesting periods of higher physiological arousal during the afternoon. These daytime peaks in heart rate deviation correlate negatively with perceived stress.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely in the **bottom_50** of the study population. This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of several factors. Firstly, while the participant exhibits elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.06), this trait has a moderate positive correlation with PSS, suggesting it could contribute to higher stress. However, other indicators lean towards lower or average stress. The participant reports relatively high GPA scores, and self-esteem is within a moderate range (Z-score = -1.43, though this scale can be tricky to interpret in isolation). Trust levels are slightly below average, and health satisfaction is also below average, but these have very weak negative correlations with PSS, suggesting they do not strongly drive stress. More importantly, the physiological data does not strongly indicate elevated stress. The lower than average Mesor and Resting Heart Rate (Z-scores of -0.7 and -0.68, respectively) are not typical of highly stressed individuals. The strong preference for sedentary entertainment and lower engagement in sports might suggest a lifestyle that could buffer against certain stressors, though they can also be associated with poor health outcomes. The sleep data indicates disturbed quality but a consistent, albeit late, schedule, which is not a definitive marker of high stress. Crucially, periods of higher physiological arousal during the afternoon (positive deviations from mesor in hourly heart rate) correlate negatively with PSS. While the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep, the consistency in sleep duration and start time, coupled with the lower average heart rate metrics, suggests that the participant may not be experiencing the chronic physiological dysregulation often associated with the top quartile of perceived stress. The positive correlations of sedentary activities with PSS are weak and not overriding. Given the mixed signals, and the absence of strong physiological indicators of high stress, it is more likely that the participant falls into the average to lower range of perceived stress within the study population.

17020,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that warrant consideration in the context of perceived stress. Self-report measures reveal a generally low level of self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.34) and above-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of 0.26). However, the participant reports a moderate level of trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 40 (Z-score of -0.13), indicating a tendency towards experiencing anxiety, though this is within the lower end of the study population. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 7, with a Z-score of 0.13, suggests a tendency towards disturbed sleep, aligning with the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" Daily recreational habits show a mixed pattern, with moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage (Z-scores of 0.01 and 0.85 respectively), but lower engagement in reading (Z-score of -0.67) and minimal socializing with friends (Z-score of -1.41). Physical health satisfaction is notably low, as indicated by a Health Satisfaction score with a Z-score of -0.78.

Wearable data provides further insights into the participant's physiological and behavioral rhythms. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a generally stable daily rhythm, as suggested by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.17 and an Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score of 0.06. However, the Intradaily Variability Z-score of 0.67 suggests a higher than average variability within daily heart rate patterns. The participant's Mesor (average heart rate level) is considerably lower than the population average (Z-score of -1.95), and their Amplitude is also lower than average (Z-score of -1.21), suggesting a more subdued physiological response range. The Resting Heart Rate is also lower than average (Z-score of -1.18). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of increased physiological arousal during the late morning and early afternoon hours, with notable positive deviations between 12 PM and 1 PM (Z-score of 0.77) and to a lesser extent between 10 AM and 11 AM (Z-score of 0.42) and 3 PM and 4 PM (Z-score of 0.11). Conversely, heart rate deviations are most negative during the early morning hours, particularly between 3 AM and 6 AM, indicating periods of low physiological activity, which aligns with typical sleep patterns but might be indicative of a shifted or disrupted sleep schedule given the reported median sleep start time of 02:12:45. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 7 minutes (Z-score of -0.08), which is close to the population average, but the Median Sleep Start Time is significantly later than typical, contributing to a potentially disrupted sleep-wake cycle.

Considering the available data, several factors suggest a PSS score potentially in the top 50th percentile. The participant reports a moderate level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.13), which, while not extremely high, is positively correlated with PSS (0.31). More significantly, the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep (Z-score of 0.13), and poor sleep quality is strongly associated with higher perceived stress. The low health satisfaction (Z-score of -0.78) also aligns with increased stress. Furthermore, the intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score of 0.67), though not directly correlated with PSS in this dataset, can be indicative of a system struggling to maintain equilibrium under stress. The relatively low engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score of -1.41) and reading (Z-score of -0.21), activities often associated with stress reduction, might also contribute to a higher perceived stress level. While some metrics like self-esteem and depressive symptoms are not indicative of high stress, the combination of trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, low health satisfaction, and potentially less robust coping mechanisms through social engagement and leisure activities, points towards a higher likelihood of experiencing elevated perceived stress.

29885,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral factors. Self-report data indicate a moderate burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D: 17.0, Z=0.38) and a slightly elevated level of chronic anxiety (STAI: 43.0, Z=0.17). Self-esteem is within the lower range of the study population (SelfEsteem: 33.0, Z=-0.73), with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress. Happiness levels are also above the population average (Happy: 4.0, Z=0.55), showing a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is notably high (Health Satisfaction: 5.56, Z=0.97). Sleep quality, as measured by PSQI, is classified as disturbed (PSQI: 7.0, Z=0.13), suggesting potential challenges in this domain.

Behavioral patterns reveal frequent engagement in substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, placing them in the upper quartile of usage for these substances. Exercise habits are robust, with more than three sessions per week of both solo and group exercise, and weekly sports participation, suggesting a physically active lifestyle. Sedentary habits are also prevalent, particularly watching TV/videos and engaging in sedentary hobbies for 1-2 hours daily. Internet usage is below the population average, while time spent listening to music and socializing with friends falls within the average range. Reading time is minimal.

Wearable data offers insights into physiological rhythms and activity. The participant exhibits a relatively high Mesor (76.44, Z=0.34) and a significantly elevated amplitude (14.65, Z=1.25) in their heart rate circadian rhythm, suggesting larger daily fluctuations in heart rate. Interdaily stability of heart rate is high (0.53, Z=1.0), indicating a regular daily pattern, while intradaily variability is lower than average (0.43, Z=-0.81), implying less fluctuation within a given day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also high (0.45, Z=1.06), further supporting a consistent daily rhythm. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (5:17 PM). Resting heart rate is below the population average (53.2, Z=-0.59). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (2-7 AM), which is more pronounced than in the general population. Conversely, heart rate deviations are notably elevated during late evening hours (9-10 PM), reaching the highest deviation in the entire day (18.9, Z=1.9).

Sleep statistics from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration slightly below the population average (6 hours 56 minutes, Z=-0.31) with a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (35 minutes, Z=-1.5), suggesting consistent but potentially insufficient sleep. Sleep start times are also variable, with a median start time around 2 AM and a moderate standard deviation (35 minutes, Z=-1.06), indicating less regularity in sleep onset. The presence of occasional naps is minimal.

The correlation analyses indicate that higher perceived stress is weakly associated with lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conversely, higher stress shows a slightly stronger association with greater variability in sleep start times and a stronger circadian amplitude. Higher stress is also weakly associated with more frequent exercise with others and less time spent reading.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the available data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be within the upper half of the study population distribution. While several indicators suggest generally positive attributes such as high health satisfaction, robust exercise habits, and a stable daily circadian rhythm, these are counterbalanced by elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, and disturbed sleep, all of which correlate positively with perceived stress. The pronounced late-evening heart rate elevation and the lower-than-average sleep duration, despite high interdaily stability, may reflect periods of heightened physiological arousal and insufficient recovery, contributing to elevated stress perception. The moderate positive correlations between perceived stress and both anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with the tendency towards higher PSS scores in individuals with less self-esteem and happiness, further supports this classification. The participant's PSS score likely falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating a relatively high level of perceived stress.

79167,10.0,0.010362694300518135,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and Fitbit-derived physiological metrics to understand the perceived stress profile of the participant. The participant presents with exceptionally low levels of self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -1.07) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.71), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Self-esteem is notably high (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.24), suggesting a robust sense of self-worth. Furthermore, the participant reports high levels of happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64) and satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 2.05). Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is considered good with a Z-score of -0.8.

Behaviorally, this participant exhibits a moderate engagement in substance use, reporting alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor) 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores indicating usage slightly above the population mean. Notably, the use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs is reported as ""Not at all,"" with negative Z-scores suggesting below-average usage in these categories. Physical activity levels are high, with consistent engagement in exercising alone, with others, and in sports (all reporting ""Three times a week or more"" and positive Z-scores), indicating a strong commitment to physical fitness. Daily recreational habits suggest a balanced approach, with low reported time spent on passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and no reported internet usage or listening to music. Time spent socializing with friends is moderate (1-2 hours), and reading is engaged in for at least 15 minutes, which aligns with a relatively low Z-score for this activity.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a resting heart rate of 52.7 bpm, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.65), potentially indicating a good level of cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis suggests a relatively regular daily pattern. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.81), and the amplitude of the heart rate variation is also below average (Z-score: -1.03), which can be indicative of a more stable physiological state. Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-score: -1.07), suggesting less consistency in daily rhythm patterns, while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.74), indicating more fluctuations within a 24-hour period. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is noted at 2:19 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, there is a significant increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor in the morning hours (6-7 AM: Z-score 3.07; 7-8 AM: Z-score 2.69), followed by a gradual decrease throughout the day, with some evening and nighttime hours showing marked deviations below the mesor (e.g., 12-1 AM: Z-score -1.42).

Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes, which is above the population average (Z-score: 1.25). The median sleep start time is late at 23:31:40, with a standard deviation in sleep start time indicating moderate regularity. The absence of daily naps is also noted. The correlation analysis with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) indicates a predominantly weak to moderate negative correlation for most self-report and behavioral measures, and a mixed pattern for wearable metrics. For instance, higher happiness and health satisfaction correlate with lower PSS scores, as does increased exercise and reading. Conversely, higher substance use (Beer, Wine or Liquor) and some aspects of daily routines (e.g., greater deviation in heart rate during certain hours) show weak positive correlations with PSS.

Considering the participant's exceptionally low scores on measures of depression, anxiety, and high scores on happiness and health satisfaction, coupled with robust physical activity and good sleep duration, the evidence strongly suggests a low perceived stress level. While some physiological metrics like intradaily variability and morning heart rate elevation warrant further investigation in relation to stress, the overwhelmingly positive self-report and behavioral data, along with the overall trend of negative correlations with PSS, indicate a participant who is managing stress effectively. The mean PSS score for the population is 21.65, with a median of 22.0. Given the participant's profile, their perceived stress score is likely to fall below this median and into the lower half of the distribution.

22455,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"This participant presents with a complex profile of self-reported psychological states, lifestyle habits, and objectively measured physiological and behavioral patterns during an academic semester. Notably, the participant reports being ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale with a Z-score of -1.31, suggesting a lower-than-average tendency for chronic anxiety proneness. This is further supported by a relatively high score on the Happiness measure (Z-score of 1.64), indicating a self-reported state of elevated happiness. Conversely, the participant exhibits a notably low Z-score of -2.71 on the Trust scale, suggesting significantly lower than average trust in others. Self-esteem appears to be above average, with a Z-score of 1.1 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Depressive symptoms, as measured by CES-D, are within the non-depressed range (Z-score of -0.14). Health satisfaction is also reported as high, with a Z-score of 1.96.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, this participant reports no substance usage of beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits indicate a moderate level of physical activity, with exercising alone reported as occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score of 1.07), while exercising with others and participation in sports are reported as occurring ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits reveal a significant engagement in sedentary activities. The participant spends ""3-4 hours"" watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 2.54) and a similar duration on the internet (Z-score of 1.52). Listening to music also occupies ""3-4 hours"" (Z-score of 1.6). Socializing with friends occurs for ""2-3 hours"" (Z-score of 0.95). Notably, reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as ""Do not do.""

The wearable-derived data offers insights into physiological regulation and sleep patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by heart rate data, shows moderate regularity, with an Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.9, suggesting less consistent daily patterns compared to the average. Intradaily Variability is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.32), indicating some fluctuation within a 24-hour period. The Mesor (average heart rate) is below the population average (Z-score of -1.04), and the Amplitude is also lower (Z-score of -1.52), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 12:35 PM. The resting heart rate is also slightly below average (Z-score of -0.52).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern. There is a significant positive deviation during the early morning hours, specifically between 5-6 AM (Z-score of 6.2) and 6-7 AM (Z-score of 4.31), and 7-8 AM (Z-score of 2.59). This suggests a pronounced physiological activation during this period, likely corresponding to wake-up and the initiation of the day's activities. Conversely, later evening hours show marked negative deviations, with particularly strong negative values between 10-11 PM (Z-score of -2.3) and 11 PM-12 AM (Z-score of -2.12), indicating a reduction in heart rate below the Mesor as the participant prepares for or enters sleep.

Sleep statistics indicate a shorter than average median sleep duration of ""6 hours 7 minutes"" (Z-score of -1.33). While the standard deviation for sleep duration is above average (Z-score of 0.94), suggesting variability, the median duration itself points to potentially insufficient sleep. The median sleep start time is relatively late at 23:20:08, with a standard deviation for sleep start time of 66 minutes (Z-score of -0.37), indicating moderate consistency in sleep onset timing. The participant also reports an average of 0.13 daily naps (Z-score of 0.7). The PSQI score of 5.0, while not above the common threshold for significant disturbance, is close to it, and the Z-score of -0.8 suggests it is slightly better than average in terms of subjective sleep quality, yet this should be considered alongside the objectively shorter sleep duration.

Overall, this participant presents with a mixed picture. They report being generally happy and not anxious, with above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction. However, they exhibit very low trust in others. Their lifestyle is characterized by a lack of substance use and moderate exercise, but also a significant amount of sedentary leisure activities. Physiologically, their circadian rhythm shows some irregularities and a below-average Mesor and Amplitude. Sleep duration is notably short, despite a PSQI score suggesting relatively good subjective sleep quality. The pronounced early morning heart rate elevation and late evening reduction are indicative of a strong diurnal physiological cycle, but the overall shorter sleep duration is a concern.

Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported psychological state presents some potential indicators that may correlate with higher perceived stress, despite overall low anxiety and high happiness. Specifically, the very low trust score (Z-score of -2.71) could indicate a disposition towards vigilance and suspicion, which can be associated with stress. While not explicitly measured by the PSS domains, such a trait might influence how stressors are perceived. Furthermore, the participant reports significant time spent on sedentary leisure activities like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, which can sometimes be compensatory behaviors for underlying stress or dissatisfaction. The objectively shorter sleep duration (median of 6 hours 7 minutes, Z-score of -1.33) is a well-established correlate of increased perceived stress and diminished well-being, even if subjective sleep quality is reported as relatively good.

Conversely, the participant's reported low anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.31), high happiness (Z-score of 1.64), and good self-esteem (Z-score of 1.1) are all factors that would typically be associated with lower perceived stress. High health satisfaction (Z-score of 1.96) also suggests a positive outlook.

Considering the population's PSS score distribution (Mean: 21.59, 50th percentile: 22.0), and the factors presented, the evidence leans towards a position in the lower half of the distribution. The protective factors of low anxiety, high happiness, and good self-esteem are strong indicators of a lower stress burden. While the low trust and short sleep duration are concerning and could contribute to stress, they do not appear to be sufficiently dominant to elevate the perceived stress score to the top 50% of the population, especially when weighed against the positive psychological self-reporting. The correlations provided between various metrics and PSS are generally weak and do not strongly tip the scale in either direction. Therefore, the overall picture suggests a participant likely falling into the bottom 50% of the PSS distribution.

57443,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant presents a complex profile with several notable features influencing their perceived stress. In terms of self-reported psychological traits, the participant reports a moderate level of anxiety proneness, as indicated by their STAI score of 40.0, which is slightly below the population mean (Z-score of -0.13). Conversely, their self-esteem is within the average range, with a score of 39.0 (Z-score of 0.11), indicating a generally positive self-worth. The participant also reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 19.0 (Z-score of 0.59), which is slightly above the population average. While their trust in others is relatively low (Score: 2.83, Z-score: -0.78), their self-reported happiness is slightly elevated (Current: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55). Health satisfaction is also within the average range (Score: 4.56, Z-score: 0.22).

Behavioral patterns suggest a generally sedentary lifestyle with minimal substance use. The participant reports no alcohol, wine, liquor, or recreational drug usage, and avoids non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is low, with solitary exercise and exercise with others occurring only 1-2 times a month, and sports participation less than 1-2 times a month. Daily recreation habits indicate significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours) and moderate time spent on internet usage (31 minutes an hour) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours). Notably, the participant does not engage in watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, reading, or other sedentary hobbies.

Wearable data reveals certain physiological and circadian rhythm characteristics. The participant exhibits a Mesor (average daily heart rate) of 80.19 bpm, which is higher than the population average (Z-score of 0.85), and a higher than average Amplitude (Z-score of 0.69), suggesting a wider daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, is around 4:40 PM. Interdaily stability of heart rate is somewhat reduced (Value: 0.5, Z-score: 0.75), indicating less regularity in daily heart rate patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is close to the population average (Value: 0.55, Z-score: 0.03). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Value: 0.46, Z-score: 1.15), suggesting a tendency for daily patterns to repeat. Resting heart rate is within the average range (Value: 61.2, Z-score: 0.36). The hourly deviation from the mesor shows notable patterns of physiological arousal. Specifically, there are pronounced deviations during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM, 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM), and also during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM). These patterns, particularly the elevated deviations during early morning and late evening/early night, could indicate disrupted physiological regulation or stress responses occurring outside typical daytime activity periods. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes, which is very close to the population average (Z-score of 0.06). However, the variability in sleep duration is low (42 minutes, Z-score of -1.33), and the sleep start time is also relatively consistent (81 minutes standard deviation, Z-score of -0.03). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by PSQI, is good (Score: 5.0, Z-Score: -0.8), which is lower than the threshold often indicating significant disturbance.

Considering the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the top 50th percentile of the study population. While some individual metrics like sleep duration and stability, self-esteem, and certain behavioral habits lean towards lower stress indicators, several other factors suggest elevated stress. The moderate to elevated CES-D score for depressive symptoms (Z-score 0.59), coupled with a slightly elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55), may suggest a complex emotional state. The observed patterns in hourly heart rate deviation, particularly elevated deviations during early morning and late evening/early night, could reflect physiological responses to stress or disrupted circadian regulation that are not captured by simpler sleep metrics or average daily patterns. Furthermore, while the PSQI indicates good subjective sleep quality, the mesor and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm are elevated, indicating increased cardiovascular activity and variability, which can be associated with stress. The moderate correlation of several of these indicators (e.g., STAI, CESD, Heart Rate deviations in early morning and late afternoon) with PSS further supports this inference.

94579,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"This participant exhibits several notable psychological and behavioral patterns that may inform their perceived stress levels. In terms of self-reported mental health, the participant reports a CES-D score of 24.0, which is above the mean and falls into the 'Depressed' classification, indicating a moderate burden of depressive symptoms. The STAI-Trait score is 44.0, suggesting a tendency towards mild chronic anxiety, with a Z-score of 0.27 indicating it is slightly above the population average for trait anxiety. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is at 37.0, which is within the upper range of scores and indicates high self-worth. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, is rated at 5.0, which is below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance and suggests good subjective sleep quality, supported by a negative Z-score (-0.8). The participant reports moderate happiness (3.0), with a slightly below-average Z-score (-0.53), and high trust in others (3.0) with a below-average Z-score (-0.46). Health satisfaction is rated at 5.0, slightly above average with a Z-score of 0.55.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in substantial physical activity, reporting exercising alone and with others ""Three times a week or more,"" with high Z-scores for both (1.07 and 1.23 respectively). Participation in sports is also very frequent, with a Z-score of 1.58. Substance usage is minimal, with beer and wine/liquor consumption being ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Regarding daily recreation, this individual dedicates significant time to reading (2-3 hours, with a very high Z-score of 4.24), listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95). They also engage in video games and general internet usage for moderate durations. Notably, TV/video/movie watching is at a lower frequency (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.01).

Wearable data reveals distinct circadian and sleep patterns. The Mesor, a measure of the average heart rate rhythm, is 71.99, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.27). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 11.99, which is moderately elevated (Z-score 0.39), suggesting a more pronounced daily swing in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, is observed at 4:17 PM, indicating a late afternoon peak. Heart rate variability shows a marked dip in the early morning hours (e.g., -22.48 deviation from mesor between 4-5 AM), and a significant elevation during mid-morning and late afternoon hours (e.g., 15.43 between 10-11 AM, 13.28 between 2-3 PM). Overall interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (0.49, Z-score 0.67), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is relatively low (0.52, Z-score -0.18), indicating less fluctuation within a day. The participant's resting heart rate is 57.6, which is very close to the population average (Z-score -0.07). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the typical recommendation and has a negative Z-score (-0.69). However, the variability in sleep duration is notably high (Z-score 3.21), suggesting inconsistency. The median sleep start time is unusually late, around 2:07 AM, with significant variability in sleep start times (Z-score 1.54), further supporting irregular sleep timing. There are no recorded daily naps.

Considering the self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, ‘Depressed’ classification) and moderate trait anxiety (STAI score of 44.0), alongside the significantly irregular sleep patterns characterized by late start times and high variability, these factors are strong indicators of potential elevated perceived stress. While self-esteem is high, and subjective sleep quality is reported as good, the objective sleep metrics point towards significant challenges. The positive correlation between CES-D and PSS score (0.29) and STAI and PSS score (0.32) further supports the link between these psychological states and perceived stress. The significant positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSS score (0.17) also aligns with the observed sleep disturbances. The high engagement in exercise and reading, while generally positive, may also represent compensatory behaviors or coping mechanisms in the face of stress.

The participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), likely places them in the top half of the study population. This is primarily supported by their elevated depressive symptomology (CES-D score of 24.0, classified as 'Depressed'), which has a moderate positive correlation (0.29) with PSS. Moderate trait anxiety (STAI score of 44.0) also shows a positive correlation (0.32) with PSS. Crucially, objective sleep data reveals significant disruptions, including a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, a notably late median sleep start time of approximately 2:07 AM, and high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 3.21) and sleep start times (Z-score 1.54). These objective sleep irregularities, particularly the high variability in sleep duration, are positively correlated with PSS scores (0.17). While the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0) and high self-esteem, the confluence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and objective sleep disruptions strongly suggests an elevated stress experience. The PSS population mean is 21.63, with a 50th percentile of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. Given the 'Depressed' classification on the CES-D and the observed sleep disturbances, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score would exceed the median and fall within the upper 50% of the distribution.

29257,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators, contextualized against the backdrop of perceived stress. Self-report data suggest a generally low burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as indicated by CES-D and STAI scores that fall below the population average. Similarly, self-esteem is reported as above average, with a corresponding modest negative correlation to perceived stress, suggesting that higher self-esteem may buffer against stress. Health satisfaction is also slightly above the population average, with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress.

Lifestyle habits indicate moderate substance use, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times per week, which is above the population average and shows a slight negative correlation with perceived stress. Wine or liquor consumption is infrequent (1-2 times per month) and recreational or non-prescribed drug use is reported as non-existent. Exercise frequency is moderate, with exercising alone and with others occurring 1-2 times per week; however, participation in sports is notably low. Daily recreational habits are characterized by extended periods of listening to music (more than 4 hours daily), which is substantially above the population average and shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. Internet usage and socializing with friends are within the lower range of reported times, while time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is also relatively low. Reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are reported as not being done.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal several patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above the population average. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability, are lower than the population average, suggesting less regularity in daily routines, and are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Intradaily Variability is also below average, indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which shows a positive correlation with perceived stress. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is close to the population average, with a slight negative deviation, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also lower than average, suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of elevated heart rate during the early morning hours (3 AM to 6 AM), with the most pronounced positive deviations occurring between 3 AM and 5 AM. This is followed by a decrease in heart rate deviation as the morning progresses, with the lowest points observed between 7 AM and 9 AM. Heart rate then tends to increase throughout the afternoon and early evening, peaking between 4 PM and 5 PM, before gradually decreasing into the late evening. The early morning elevation in heart rate deviation, particularly during sleep hours, is a notable finding.

Sleep statistics indicate that the median sleep duration is slightly longer than the population average, though the standard deviation for sleep duration is higher, suggesting variability in sleep length. The median sleep start time is early in the morning (1:32 AM), with a standard deviation that is close to the population average. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI, with a score significantly below the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Notably, there are no recorded daily naps.

Overall, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. While self-reported psychological well-being indicators (depression, anxiety, self-esteem) and subjective sleep quality are favorable and generally suggest lower perceived stress, certain behavioral and physiological patterns warrant consideration. The prolonged listening to music, low engagement in sports, and elevated heart rate deviations during early morning hours are areas that might contribute to stress, despite other seemingly positive indicators. The moderate negative correlations observed between Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score and self-esteem, and health satisfaction, suggest that these factors may offer some resilience. However, the negative correlation between Interdaily Stability and PSS, alongside the positive correlation with Intradaily Variability, suggests that a less structured daily rhythm might be associated with higher perceived stress, though the magnitude of these correlations is modest.

The participant's self-reported measures of depression (CESD), anxiety (STAI), and subjective sleep quality (PSQI) are all below population averages, indicating a low burden of these symptoms. Self-esteem is above average. These factors generally point towards lower perceived stress. Furthermore, health satisfaction and trust levels are also above average. While several daily habits are reported with less frequency (e.g., sports, reading, sedentary hobbies), others such as listening to music are particularly high. The median sleep duration is longer than average, and the PSQI classification is ""Good Sleep."" These indicators collectively suggest that the participant is likely to have a PSS score in the bottom half of the distribution.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, as evidenced by significantly low Z-scores on the STAI (-1.81) and CES-D (-1.07) scales, respectively. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.96), and the participant reports moderate health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8). Trust in others is also slightly elevated (Z-score 0.83). While sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is indicated as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 6.0 (Z-score -0.33), this score is only marginally below the population mean, suggesting it may not be a pronounced issue. Subjective happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in minimal substance use, with no reported consumption of beer, wine/liquor, or recreational drugs. Non-prescribed drug usage is also absent. Physical activity levels are characterized by infrequent solo exercise (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score -1.18) and slightly less frequent exercise with others (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score -0.88). However, participation in sports is more regular, occurring ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.91), indicating some engagement in structured physical activity. Daily recreational habits suggest moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18) and a tendency towards sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.62) and playing video games (participant reports ""Do not do,"" Z-score -0.56). Time spent listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.72) and socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62) is also relatively low. Reading is also at a lower frequency (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32), which is contrary to the higher Z-score suggesting more time spent reading.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm analysis reveals a generally stable pattern. Interdaily stability (0.5, Z-score 0.75) is moderately high, suggesting good regularity between days, while intradaily variability (0.83, Z-score 2.01) is notably high. This high intradaily variability, coupled with an average heart rate deviation from the mesor peaking significantly in the late evening (11 PM - 12 AM, Z-score 4.79), indicates substantial fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor (62.43, Z-score -1.57) is below average, suggesting a lower baseline heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 5:26 PM. The resting heart rate (47.8, Z-score -1.23) is also notably low. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes (Z-score 0.18), which is close to average, and a low standard deviation in sleep duration (36 minutes, Z-score -1.47), suggesting consistent sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is late at 1:45 AM, with a standard deviation of 39 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The participant does not engage in daily naps.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The provided data does not directly include the participant's overall Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. However, an inference can be made by examining related metrics and their correlations with PSS.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Several self-report measures suggest a relatively low stress profile. The participant reports significantly low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.81) and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -1.07). Self-esteem is above average (Z-score 0.96), and trust in others is also slightly elevated (Z-score 0.83). Health satisfaction is also moderately high (Z-score 0.8). While PSQI indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 6.0, Z-score -0.33), this is not a highly deviant score, suggesting sleep quality might not be a major stressor. Subjective happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), which could be a minor indicator of stress, but the overall pattern of low anxiety and depression is more salient.

Physiologically, the low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.23) and below-average mesor (Z-score -1.57) could indicate a generally calm physiological state. Consistent sleep duration (low standard deviation, Z-score -1.47) also points towards better stress regulation.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The most prominent physiological indicator potentially linked to higher stress is the very high intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 2.01). This suggests significant physiological reactivity and fluctuation throughout the day, which can be associated with elevated stress. The extreme peak in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late evening (11 PM - 12 AM, Z-score 4.79) further emphasizes this pattern of heightened physiological arousal at specific times. The late median sleep start time (01:45:29) and its variability might also contribute to stress, although it is not extremely pronounced.

Behaviorally, the low frequency of exercise, particularly exercising alone, and limited engagement in social activities could be indirect contributors to stress. However, the presence of regular sports participation offers a counterpoint.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the totality of the evidence, the participant presents with a complex profile. The low scores on anxiety and depression, coupled with relatively good self-esteem and health satisfaction, strongly suggest a lower baseline of perceived stress. The physiological data, however, reveals a significant degree of intradaily variability in heart rate and a pronounced late-night arousal pattern, which are indicators often associated with higher stress levels. The consistent sleep duration is a positive factor, but the late sleep onset might be a contributing element.

Despite the concerning physiological variability, the absence of significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, along with higher self-esteem, weighs heavily towards a less stressed profile. The strong negative correlations of low anxiety and depression with PSS scores in similar populations would suggest that the absence of these symptoms would drive the PSS score lower. While the physiological data warrants attention, the psychological self-reports paint a picture of good coping and lower perceived stress. Therefore, it is more likely that the participant falls into the **bottom 50th percentile** for PSS.

63904,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant's self-reported data indicates elevated levels of psychological distress. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 30.0, with a z-score of 1.74, suggests a significantly higher burden of depressive symptoms compared to the study population, aligning with a classification of 'Depressed'. Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 53.0, with a z-score of 1.16, indicates a tendency towards higher levels of chronic anxiety, classifying the participant as 'anxious'. These findings are positively correlated with perceived stress, with CES-D showing a correlation of 0.28 and STAI exhibiting a correlation of 0.31. While self-esteem is relatively lower than average (z-score of -1.15), trust is notably low (z-score of -2.07), and self-reported happiness is also below the population average (z-score of -1.61), these lower scores are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that while these factors might contribute to an individual's overall psychological profile, their direct relationship with PSS in this dataset is inverse or negligible. The participant reports moderate academic performance with a GPA of 3.86 in Fall 2016. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as 'Disturbed Sleep' (z-score of -0.33), with a median sleep duration of approximately 5 hours and 49 minutes (z-score of -1.69), indicating significantly shorter sleep than the population average and greater sleep duration variability (z-score of -1.61). These sleep metrics, particularly the reduced duration, are negatively correlated with perceived stress.

The wearable-derived physiological and behavioral data reveal a participant with a generally stable circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a relatively moderate Interdaily Stability (z-score of 1.0) and Intradaily Variability (z-score of 0.6). The MESOR, representing the daily average heart rate, is slightly above average (z-score of 0.37), and the Amplitude, reflecting the daily variation, is close to the population average (z-score of -0.06). The acrophase (peak heart rate time) occurs in the afternoon at 3:36 PM, which is within the typical range. Resting heart rate is also slightly elevated (z-score of 0.28) but not significantly so. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR suggests a pattern of elevated heart rate during typical waking hours, particularly from 8-9 AM (z-score of 1.58) and 7-8 PM (z-score of 0.45), with notable dips during late night and early morning hours, which is congruent with a typical sleep-wake cycle. However, the significant negative deviations observed between 2 AM and 6 AM (e.g., -21.9 at 5-6 AM) suggest a period of substantial cardiovascular rest during the night. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (z-score of 1.06) indicates a moderate regularity in daily heart rate patterns. Behavioral data from wearables show no reported substance usage or exercise (alone, with others, or sports), and limited engagement in sedentary hobbies like reading or video games. The participant does report moderate engagement in internet usage (2-3 hours, z-score of 0.85) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, z-score of 0.95). These behaviors generally show weak to negligible correlations with perceived stress.

Considering the comprehensive analysis of both self-report and wearable data, the participant exhibits significant indicators of elevated perceived stress. The strong presence of depressive symptoms (CES-D z-score of 1.74) and anxiety proneness (STAI z-score of 1.16), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, are primary drivers for this assessment. While some metrics, such as shorter sleep duration and lower self-esteem, are negatively correlated with PSS in this dataset, their presence alongside the pronounced psychological distress symptoms suggests a complex interplay. The physiological data, while not showing overtly pathological patterns, are within a range that does not mitigate the psychological indicators of stress. The consistent pattern of elevated mood disturbances and anxiety, coupled with the positive correlations observed with PSS, strongly suggests that this participant falls within the higher range of perceived stress.

20335,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological data. Regarding psychological well-being, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z-score -1.18) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 23.0, Z-score -1.81), both falling below the population mean, suggesting a generally stable emotional state. Self-esteem is notably high (Score 50.0, Z-score 1.66), which is inversely correlated with perceived stress. Similarly, self-reported happiness is elevated (Current 5.0, Z-score 1.64). Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Score 6.0, Z-score 1.3), indicating positive subjective experiences related to physical well-being. Trust in others is near the population average (Score 3.17, Z-score -0.14).

The participant's sleep patterns, as assessed by the PSQI, indicate good subjective sleep quality (Score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), which is generally protective against higher stress levels. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score -0.74), which is below the typical recommendation but not extremely low. The variability in sleep duration is moderate (Z-score -0.33). The median sleep start time is late, at 01:53:44, with low variability (Z-score -1.24), suggesting a consistent, albeit delayed, sleep schedule. The low incidence of napping (Mean Daily Naps 0.08, Z-score 0.04) indicates limited daytime sleep seeking.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Usage '1-2 times a week', Z-score 0.94) being more frequent than monthly beer consumption (Usage '1-2 times a month', Z-score 0.3). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Physical activity levels are notable, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Frequency 'Three times a week or more', Z-score 1.07). However, exercising with others and participation in sports are less frequent (1-2 times a month). Daily recreational habits show substantial engagement in sedentary activities such as video games (Time '31 minutes an hour', Z-score 1.71) and listening to music (Time '2-3 hours', Z-score 1.13), and considerable time spent socializing with friends (Time '3-4 hours', Z-score 1.74). Reading time is moderate (Time '16-30 minutes', Z-score 1.3).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm, with interdaily stability at 0.57 (Z-score 1.33) and intradaily variability at 0.66 (Z-score 0.81), suggesting moderate consistency in daily activity patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value 0.43, Z-score 0.9) further supports this regularity. The mesor (mean heart rate level) is slightly above the population average (Value 78.09, Z-score 0.57), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also higher than average (Value 13.56, Z-score 0.9), indicating a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is recorded at 6:06 PM, suggesting a later peak in cardiovascular activity. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below the population mean (Value 55.0, Z-score -0.37), which is generally a favorable physiological marker.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significant elevations in heart rate during late evening hours (e.g., 12-1 am: 23.89, Z-score 3.66; 10-11 pm: 13.71, Z-score 1.14; 6-7 pm: 20.3, Z-score 1.35), and also during early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 am: -25.52, Z-score -1.23; 5-6 am: -26.03, Z-score -1.11; 6-7 am: -26.12, Z-score -1.21). These deviations, particularly the pronounced positive deviations in the evening and nighttime, suggest periods of heightened physiological arousal during times typically associated with rest. The strongest positive deviations occur in the late evening and into the early morning, preceding a period of lowest negative deviation during the 4-6 am period. These patterns may reflect the influence of late-night activities or internal physiological processes contributing to cardiovascular activity before the onset of sleep and morning wake-up. The correlation analysis indicates weak associations between these physiological and behavioral metrics and PSS scores. Notably, higher self-esteem and happiness are weakly correlated with lower PSS scores, while traits such as anxiety proneness and lower health satisfaction show a slight positive correlation with PSS. Sedentary habits, like video gaming and reading, also show a slight inverse correlation with PSS.

The participant's PSS score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population distribution. This assessment is based on several protective factors identified in the data. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, alongside high self-esteem and happiness, which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is good, and while sleep duration is slightly below average, the sleep schedule is consistent. Engagement in regular solo exercise, although not high frequency in team sports or group exercise, contributes positively. The absence of significant substance use beyond moderate weekly alcohol consumption is also a favorable indicator. While there are some periods of elevated heart rate in the late evening and early morning, the overall circadian rhythm regularity and a slightly lower resting heart rate are neutral to positive indicators. The weak negative correlations between PSS and positive psychological states (self-esteem, happiness) and certain habits (reading, video gaming) further support the inference of lower perceived stress. The population PSS mean is 21.62, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. Given the protective psychological profile, it is reasonable to infer that this participant's PSS score would not place them in the upper half of the distribution.

35031,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics that collectively inform an understanding of their perceived stress. Psychologically, the participant reports a low level of chronic anxiety as indicated by a STAI–Trait score of 27.0, which falls in the 15th percentile relative to the study population (Z-score of -1.41). Similarly, depressive symptoms are reported as infrequent, with a CES-D score of 6.0 (Z-score of -0.76). Self-esteem is slightly above average, indicated by a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 43.0 (Z-score of 0.68). Health satisfaction is also marginally above average (Z-score of 0.13). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as good (Score of 5.0, Z-score of -0.8), suggesting adequate perceived rest.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle includes moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, placing them in the upper quartile of usage for these substances (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94, respectively). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Physical activity is moderate, with exercise occurring 1-2 times a week for all reported categories (alone, with others, and sports), with sports participation being more frequent than average for the study population (Z-score of 0.91). Daily recreation involves a mix of sedentary activities, with significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage (Z-scores of 0.64 and -0.49, respectively). Socializing with friends is also a notable activity, with 2-3 hours reported daily (Z-score of 0.95). Notably, dedicated reading time and video game engagement are reported as absent.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals several key patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits low interdaily stability (Value of 0.19, Z-score of -1.81) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value of 0.1, Z-score of -1.87), suggesting a less regular daily rhythm. This is further supported by a lower than average amplitude of heart rate variation (Value of 5.05, Z-score of -1.85). The MESOR, representing the average heart rate, is slightly elevated compared to the population average (Value of 82.2, Z-score of 1.13). Resting heart rate is also notably higher than the population average (Value of 75.5, Z-score of 2.06). The hourly deviation from mesor data indicates a pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, with deviations of -8.11 to -9.67), suggesting a period of very low physiological activity, likely during deep sleep. Conversely, heart rate tends to increase in the late evening and night, peaking between 10-11 PM (deviation of 8.51) and 11 PM-12 AM (deviation of 9.94), which may reflect activity or arousal before sleep. Sleep duration is slightly longer than the population median (8 hours 3 minutes, Z-score of 1.08), but sleep start times are variable, with a median start time around midnight and a standard deviation of 96 minutes. Napping frequency is slightly above average.

Considering the overall PSS score of the participant, which is not directly provided but can be inferred by examining the provided population statistics, the participant's individual metrics and their correlations with PSS provide insight. The population's mean PSS is 21.62, with a median of 22.0. The participant's reported low anxiety (STAI), low depressive symptoms (CESD), and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI) are generally associated with lower perceived stress. However, the physiological data presents some conflicting indicators. The elevated resting heart rate and MESOR, coupled with the significant deviations from the mesor during the night and late evening, could suggest underlying physiological strain or a less regulated cardiovascular system, which may be indirectly linked to stress. The low interdaily stability and autocorrelation in heart rate also point to a less structured daily rhythm, which can be a correlate of increased stress. While many self-reported measures are favorable, the physiological data, particularly the circadian rhythm metrics and resting heart rate, suggest a potential for elevated stress. Given that the correlations provided are relatively small, and the self-report data leans towards lower stress indicators, a holistic assessment would require knowing the participant's actual PSS score. However, if we consider the potential impact of physiological dysregulation on perceived stress, the elevated resting heart rate and disturbed circadian rhythm metrics are noteworthy. Without a direct PSS score, and relying on the aggregated population data, we can infer that if the participant's PSS score were to fall in the upper half, it would be influenced by these physiological markers, despite otherwise positive self-report data. Conversely, if their score were in the lower half, it would be supported by their psychological and subjective sleep metrics. The provided data does not definitively place the participant in either group without their specific PSS score. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that the confluence of higher resting heart rate, MESOR, and circadian rhythm irregularities, despite positive psychological self-reports, leans towards a moderate to elevated stress profile.

88185,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents a complex profile with several indicators that warrant careful consideration in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported psychological traits suggest a generally low baseline for anxiety and depressive symptoms, with STAI scores indicating a low proneness to chronic anxiety and CES-D scores falling within the ""Not depressed"" classification. Similarly, self-esteem scores are above average, and trust in others is also relatively high. However, reported happiness is notably elevated, with a Z-score of 1.64, suggesting a potential disconnect or an overestimation of current well-being. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" though the Z-score indicates this is only marginally poorer than the population average. Academic performance, reflected in GPA, is consistently high, suggesting effective coping mechanisms or a high capacity for academic engagement.

Behavioral patterns reveal a proactive approach to physical activity, with the participant exercising alone ""Three times a week or more,"" which is significantly above the population average (Z-score of 1.07). Conversely, participation in group exercise and sports is infrequent. Daily recreational habits indicate a substantial engagement with listening to music (more than 4 hours daily, Z-score of 2.06) and moderate internet usage. Socializing with friends is also reported at a healthy level (2-3 hours daily). Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is reported as ""Not at all,"" which is significantly lower than the population average. Notably, sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games are not engaged in, and reading and other sedentary hobbies are limited to 15 minutes or less.

Physiological data from wearable devices present a mixed picture. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively stable daily pattern, as indicated by an interdaily stability Z-score of 1.33, suggesting a well-defined daily cycle in heart rate. The acrophase at 5:00 PM suggests a peak in heart rate in the late afternoon. The amplitude is moderately elevated, and the MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) is also above the population average, suggesting a generally higher baseline heart rate and potentially greater physiological arousal during the day. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows notable deviations from the mesor, particularly in the early morning hours (4-8 AM), where deviations are significantly negative (e.g., -26.06 at 6-7 AM, Z-score -1.21). This suggests a period of significantly lower heart rate during these hours, potentially indicative of deep sleep or reduced activity. In contrast, the afternoon and early evening hours (1-3 PM and 6-10 PM) show consistently positive deviations, suggesting periods of increased cardiovascular activity during these times. Sleep statistics indicate a shorter than average median sleep duration (6 hours 37 minutes, Z-score -0.7) and a high variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 88 minutes, Z-score 0.11), despite a relatively stable sleep start time of around 2:25 AM. This suggests that while the participant might have a general sleep window, the exact timing of sleep onset is quite inconsistent. The low correlation coefficients observed between most metrics and PSS scores suggest that these individual factors do not strongly predict perceived stress levels in isolation for this participant, requiring a more holistic interpretation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score:**

The participant exhibits several characteristics that could be associated with both lower and higher perceived stress. On the side of lower perceived stress, their low scores on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with high self-esteem and academic achievement, are strong indicators of resilience and effective coping. Their complete abstinence from substance use further suggests a commitment to healthy behaviors. However, several factors lean towards potentially elevated perceived stress. The ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, combined with a shorter than average sleep duration and inconsistent sleep start times, points towards physiological and behavioral dysregulation that can exacerbate stress. The notably elevated happiness score, while seemingly positive, could indicate a tendency towards positive affectivity that might mask underlying stress, or an overstatement of current well-being. The significant engagement in music listening and moderate internet usage, while not inherently stressful, could represent attempts at distraction or coping mechanisms that, if excessive, might detract from other stress-reducing activities or responsibilities. The elevated MESOR and Amplitude in heart rate data, alongside periods of significant deviation, suggest a more reactive cardiovascular system.

Considering the average PSS score for the population is 21.62, with a median of 22.0, and the 75th percentile at 24.0, the participant's profile presents a dichotomy. Their strong psychological resilience and healthy lifestyle choices would typically place them in the bottom 50% of perceived stress. However, the compromised sleep patterns and potentially high physiological reactivity are significant indicators that are often associated with higher stress levels. Given the absence of direct PSS scores, and relying on the correlations provided, the majority of observed correlations with PSS are weak and do not strongly indicate a high stress level. The most significant positive correlation with PSS comes from the early morning deviations from mesor (4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM), which are negative deviations suggesting lower heart rate during waking hours. The negative correlations with PSS are stronger for metrics like self-esteem, trust, and health satisfaction.

Despite the indicators of disturbed sleep and physiological reactivity, the robust psychological resilience and low scores on anxiety and depression scales are more compelling predictors of lower perceived stress. The data suggests a highly driven individual with effective coping mechanisms for academic demands, but perhaps struggling with sleep regulation. Without direct PSS scores, the balance of evidence points towards a perceived stress level that is not disproportionately high compared to their peers, especially considering the positive indicators of psychological well-being and academic success. Therefore, it is more probable that this participant falls within the bottom half of the PSS distribution.

35344,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by elevated psychological distress, notably in anxiety and depressive symptomology, coupled with generally poorer sleep quality. The STAI-Trait score of 62.0 places them in the anxious classification, with a Z-score of 2.05, indicating a significantly higher level of chronic anxiety compared to the study population. Similarly, the CES-D score of 28.0 suggests a notable burden of depressive symptoms, reflected by a Z-score of 1.53 and classified as ""Depressed."" These elevated scores are positively correlated with perceived stress, with STAI-Trait showing a correlation of 0.31 and CES-D showing 0.28. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is relatively low with a score of 27.0 and a Z-score of -1.57, suggesting lower self-worth, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.15). Happiness levels are also reported as low, with a current score of 2.0 and a Z-score of -1.61, negatively correlating with perceived stress (-0.19).

Sleep quality appears to be a significant area of concern, as indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0 and a Z-score of 1.05, leading to a ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, which is consistent with the general trend of heightened psychological distress. While the median sleep duration of 7 hours and 47 minutes is within a reasonable range (Z-score 0.74), the standard deviation of sleep duration (92 minutes, Z-score -0.21) and median sleep start time (00:03:03 with a standard deviation of 61 minutes, Z-score -0.48) suggest some irregularity in sleep patterns. This sleep disturbance is not strongly correlated with perceived stress, with sleep duration showing a slight negative correlation (-0.05).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively, indicating usage above the population mean. They report no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. In terms of exercise, the participant engages in exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), which is a positive indicator of physical activity. However, exercising with others and participating in sports occur less frequently (1-2 times a month and 1-2 times a week respectively, with Z-scores of -0.17 and 0.91). Daily recreation habits reveal a mixed pattern: significant time is spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and moderate internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.16). Notably, passive or solitary activities like listening to music and reading are reported as ""Do not do,"" with substantial negative Z-scores (-1.19 and -0.67 respectively), suggesting a potential lack of engagement in these beneficial activities. Socializing with friends is also reported as minimal (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41), and video game usage is absent. These patterns of lower social engagement and a preference for less active leisure may indirectly contribute to or reflect psychological states.

Physiologically, as indicated by Fitbit data, the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate stability. The Interdaily Stability (0.44, Z-score 0.25) and Intradaily Variability (0.56, Z-score 0.1) suggest a somewhat regular daily pattern of physiological activity. The MESOR (78.01, Z-score 0.56) is slightly above the population mean, and the Amplitude (11.25, Z-score 0.15) is within the average range. The Acrophase at 3:51 PM indicates the peak of their circadian rhythm in the late afternoon. The resting heart rate is 63.8 bpm with a Z-score of 0.67, indicating it is slightly higher than the population average. The hourly deviations from the mesor reveal a pattern of lower cardiovascular activity during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM showing negative deviations with Z-scores ranging from -1.39 to 0.5), potentially reflecting sleep periods. During daytime hours, particularly from 9 AM onwards, heart rate generally deviates positively from the mesor, peaking in the late afternoon (e.g., 3-5 PM with deviations of 12.88 and 13.28, and Z-scores of 0.72 and 0.67), which is typical of diurnal activity. While these circadian metrics do not show strong correlations with perceived stress, the slightly elevated resting heart rate and the patterns of deviation suggest a generally alert state during wakeful periods.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant presents with multiple indicators suggesting a higher perceived stress level. The elevated scores on the STAI-Trait (anxiety) and CES-D (depressive symptoms) are strongly associated with increased perceived stress, as evidenced by their positive correlations. Low self-esteem and low self-reported happiness further corroborate a state of psychological distress that often co-occurs with high perceived stress. While sleep quality is identified as disturbed, its direct correlation with the PSS score is not particularly strong in this data. However, disturbed sleep is a common consequence and contributor to heightened stress. Behavioral patterns, such as limited social interaction and potentially less engagement in restorative leisure activities, may also contribute to or reflect a higher stress burden. Considering the significant elevation in anxiety and depressive symptomology, coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, the evidence strongly points towards a PSS score that would place the participant in the upper half of the study population distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.61, with the 50th percentile at 22.0. Given the prominent psychological distress indicators, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score exceeds this threshold.

Self-report measures indicate a moderate level of anxiety proneness (STAI score of 40, Z-score -0.13, correlating positively with PSS at 0.31) and a subjective experience of disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 8.0, Z-score 0.59). While their depressive symptomology is within the non-depressed range (CES-D score of 12.0, Z-score -0.14, with a weak positive correlation to PSS), and self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES score of 41, Z-score 0.4, with a negative correlation to PSS), the interplay between anxiety and poor sleep quality warrants attention. The participant also reports lower than average happiness (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53, with a negative correlation to PSS), suggesting a potential mood component influencing their overall well-being.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, with beer consumption showing a slight negative correlation to PSS. Their exercise habits are characterized by frequent individual exercise and sports participation (exercising alone and sports both with Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.58 respectively, both correlating negatively with PSS), but no exercise with others. Daily recreational activities are varied, with higher than average engagement in watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and listening to music, while socialising with friends is notably high (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74, with a weak positive correlation to PSS). Notably, they do not engage in reading or other sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of heart rate is within the average range (Value 0.39, Z-score -0.16), and intraday variability is low (Value 0.3, Z-score -1.73), suggesting a structured daily pattern. The participant's mesor (average daily heart rate) is below population average (Value 64.59, Z-score -1.28), and their amplitude is also lower than average (Value 8.28, Z-score -0.81), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Their resting heart rate is at the population average (Value 57.8, Z-score -0.04). The pattern of heart rate deviation from mesor indicates elevated heart rates during the afternoon and early evening, peaking between 2-3 PM and 4-5 PM, followed by a significant dip in the late evening and early morning hours, aligning with a likely sleep period.

Sleep statistics highlight exceptionally long median sleep durations (9 hours 34 minutes, Z-score 2.96), contrasting with the subjective report of disturbed sleep from the PSQI. The high standard deviation in sleep duration (249 minutes, Z-score 3.37) suggests considerable variability in sleep timing and duration, which, despite the long median, could contribute to feelings of poor sleep quality. The median sleep start time is late (23:17:41), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (84 minutes, Z-score 0.03). The data suggests that while the participant obtains a substantial amount of sleep, the regularity and perceived quality of this sleep may be compromised, potentially contributing to their higher anxiety and lower happiness levels.

In summation, the participant presents with elevated anxiety and disturbed sleep, coupled with high social engagement and frequent physical activity. The physiological data indicates a generally stable circadian rhythm with lower-than-average heart rate variability, but with a distinct afternoon peak in arousal and a late sleep onset. The significant positive correlation between STAI scores and PSS, alongside the PSQI findings, strongly suggests that anxiety and sleep issues are key contributors to perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.13) and disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score of 0.59) are factors that tend to be associated with higher perceived stress. The positive correlation between STAI and PSS (0.31) supports this. While their CES-D score indicates no depression, and self-esteem is slightly above average, the anxiety component appears significant. The highly variable sleep duration, despite a long median, could also contribute to stress. Considering the population PSS mean of 21.61 and median of 22.0, and the participant's likely elevated anxiety and sleep disturbances, it is probable their PSS score falls within the upper half of the distribution.

58793,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents a complex interplay of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm metrics, all considered in relation to their perceived stress level (PSS). Notably, the participant reports relatively low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.34) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -0.8), which might be expected to correlate with lower perceived stress. However, their trait anxiety score (STAI Z-score: 0.46) is in the upper quartile, suggesting a predisposition towards anxiety which could contribute to heightened stress perception. Self-esteem is relatively low (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.73), and happiness levels are also below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Health satisfaction, while not exceedingly high, is above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 1.3), indicating a generally positive outlook on their physical health.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent exercise, with both solitary and group exercise occurring three times a week or more, and sports participation 1-2 times a week. This aligns with a generally active lifestyle. Their leisure time is not dominated by passive screen activities like watching TV or playing video games, nor by extensive internet usage. Instead, they report significant time spent socializing with friends (Z-score: 1.74), which can be a protective factor against stress. However, engagement with reading and sedentary hobbies is notably absent. Substance use patterns are mixed, with moderate alcohol consumption (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week) and low beer consumption.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, indicated by moderate interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.09) and a moderate intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.46) in heart rate. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 1.06) suggests some regularity in daily patterns. The participant's mesor (mean heart rate adjusted for circadian rhythm) is elevated (Z-score: 0.77) and their amplitude (range of daily heart rate variation) is also notable (Z-score: 1.0), potentially reflecting a more reactive cardiovascular system. Resting heart rate is within the average range (Z-score: 0.07). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late morning and afternoon hours (8-9 AM: Z-score 3.52, 2-3 PM: Z-score 2.03, 4-5 PM: Z-score 2.0). These peaks in heart rate deviation could signify periods of heightened physiological arousal or stress response during these times. Sleep duration is notably long, with a median of 9 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score: 2.3), which might indicate compensatory sleep behavior or simply a natural preference for longer sleep. Sleep start times are somewhat variable (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.46).

Considering the PSS population data, the mean PSS score is 21.62, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. This participant's elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem and happiness, coupled with specific peaks in physiological arousal during typical waking hours, suggest a potential for higher perceived stress. While certain factors like good subjective sleep quality and active social engagement could mitigate stress, the overall pattern leans towards a more stressed profile.

The participant's traits and behaviors suggest a likelihood of experiencing elevated perceived stress. Their trait anxiety score (STAI Z-score: 0.46) is above average, indicating a general tendency towards anxiousness. While they report good subjective sleep quality and low depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.73) and happiness (Happy Z-score: -0.53) are also indicative of potential stress. The physiological data reveals periods of significant heart rate elevation during late morning and afternoon, particularly the 8-9 AM and 2-3 PM and 4-5 PM intervals, which can be interpreted as markers of increased physiological arousal possibly linked to stress. The long sleep duration, while seemingly positive, could also be a coping mechanism for stress.

The combination of higher trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and physiological indicators of arousal during key parts of the day strongly suggests that this participant is likely to fall within the upper half of the study population distribution for perceived stress.

96689,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by generally normative self-reported psychological traits and lifestyle behaviors, with a few notable deviations. Depression symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are within the non-depressed range with a Z-score of -0.76, suggesting a lower burden of such symptoms relative to the study population. Similarly, self-esteem is slightly above average with a Z-score of 0.11, and current happiness is in the lower half of the distribution (Z-score of -0.53). Trust in others is also slightly above average (Z-score of 0.18). Trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is elevated with a Z-score of 0.56, classifying the participant as anxious. Sleep quality, evaluated by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed, with a Z-score of -0.33, indicating a mild deviation from optimal sleep. Health satisfaction is notably low, with a Z-score of -1.61, suggesting significant dissatisfaction with physical health.

Behaviorally, the participant abstains from substance use, with all categories of alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drugs indicating ""Not at all"" usage, reflected in substantially negative Z-scores. Physical activity levels are minimal, with no reported exercise alone, with others, or participation in sports, indicated by highly negative Z-scores for frequency. In terms of daily recreational habits, internet usage falls within the moderate range (1-2 hours), with a Z-score of 0.18. Listening to music is reported for 16-30 minutes, and socializing with friends for 2-3 hours, the latter being a relatively high engagement (Z-score of 0.95). Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for minimal durations (15 minutes or less).

Wearable data reveals a mesor (average heart rate) slightly above population average (Z-score of 0.52) and an amplitude indicative of a more pronounced diurnal heart rate variation (Z-score of 1.36). The acrophase of 5:14 PM suggests the peak in heart rate occurs in the late afternoon. There is a notable pattern of increased heart rate deviation from the mesor during the evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 6 PM and 10 PM, which are significantly elevated compared to the average. Conversely, deviations are substantially negative during the early morning hours (2 AM to 7 AM), indicating periods of significantly lower heart rate activity than the daily average during sleep or rest. Resting heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score of 0.08).

Circadian rhythm metrics suggest some disruption in regularity. Interdaily Stability is below average (Z-score of 0.75), and Intradaily Variability is above average (Z-score of 0.74), indicating less consistent daily patterns and more variability within days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also notably low (Z-score of 0.98), further suggesting a less regular circadian rhythm. Sleep statistics indicate a near-average median sleep duration (Z-score of 0.14) but a significantly lower standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of -1.42), suggesting highly consistent sleep durations. The median sleep start time is early in the morning (01:55:30), with a low standard deviation (Z-score of -1.19), indicating very consistent, albeit late, sleep onset. There are no reported daily naps.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score will be evaluated to determine if it falls within the top or bottom half of the study population distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.62, with a median of 22.0. A score below or equal to 22.0 would place an individual in the bottom 50th percentile.

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is somewhat mixed. On one hand, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.76) and a slightly above average self-esteem (Z-score of 0.11), as well as higher than average trust (Z-score of 0.18). They also exhibit very low engagement in substance use and minimal physical activity, which could be interpreted as passive coping mechanisms. Furthermore, sleep duration is consistent (low standard deviation in sleep duration).

However, there are several indicators suggesting elevated stress or factors that could contribute to it. The participant reports an anxious trait classification (STAI Z-score of 0.56) and significantly low health satisfaction (Z-score of -1.61). The wearable data points to a disrupted circadian rhythm, evidenced by low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability, alongside a low 24-hour autocorrelation. The significant elevations in heart rate deviation from the mesor during evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM) suggest physiological arousal during times that are typically associated with relaxation and sleep preparation, which could be indicative of stress-related hyperarousal. The consistent but late sleep start time (median 01:55) also points to potential sleep schedule irregularities that can be linked to stress. While sleep duration is consistent, the timing might be maladaptive. The participant's recreational habits show a substantial amount of time spent socializing with friends (Z-score of 0.95), which can be a positive coping mechanism, but also potentially a source of social pressure or demands.

Considering the presence of elevated trait anxiety, disrupted circadian rhythmicity, and physiological arousal patterns during evening/night, coupled with very low health satisfaction, these factors collectively lean towards an interpretation of elevated perceived stress, despite some positive self-report measures in areas like depression and self-esteem. The physiological indicators of stress, particularly the elevated heart rate during later hours and circadian dysregulation, are strong signals. Given the population's median PSS is 22.0, and the pattern of anxious traits and physiological arousal, it is plausible that this participant's PSS score falls within the higher range.

Therefore, a holistic analysis of the evidence, particularly the physiological markers of arousal and circadian disruption, alongside reported trait anxiety and low health satisfaction, suggests that the participant likely experiences a PSS score in the top half of the distribution.

33657,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant presents with a multifaceted profile concerning perceived stress. Self-reported data indicate moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16.0, Z-score of 0.28) and objectively good self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 41.0, Z-score of 0.4), aligning with a classification of ""not anxious"" on the STAI trait measure (score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.43). Subjective sleep quality is reported as ""Disturbed Sleep"" by the PSQI (score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.33), suggesting potential challenges in this domain despite a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, which falls within a typical range with a Z-score of -0.13. The participant demonstrates higher-than-average trust of others (score of 3.5, Z-score of 0.5) and happiness (current score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55). Behavioral patterns include moderate substance usage (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) and infrequent engagement in sports (not at all). Notably, the participant engages in prolonged sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours, Z-score of 3.19) and significant internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85), while less time is allocated to watching TV/videos/movies and reading.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal certain circadian rhythm irregularities. The mesor (average daily heart rate) is notably low (Value: 63.24, Z-Score: -1.46), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also reduced (Value: 7.12, Z-Score: -1.18), suggesting a blunted daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late in the day at 3:16 PM. Interdaily stability is somewhat low (Value: 0.35, Z-Score: -0.49), indicating less consistency in daily heart rate patterns, while intradaily variability is elevated (Value: 0.65, Z-Score: 0.74), suggesting more fluctuation in heart rate within a day. The resting heart rate is below average (Value: 51.2, Z-Score: -0.83). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates several periods of elevated physiological arousal, particularly during the morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM deviation of -15.15, Z-score 0.49; 5-6 AM deviation of -16.31, Z-score 0.30; 6-7 AM deviation of -17.59, Z-score -0.05) and late morning to early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM deviation of 23.67, Z-score 2.71). Conversely, there are significant dips in heart rate during the evening and night hours. The mean daily naps are substantially higher than the population average (Value: 0.26, Z-Score: 2.23).

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is evaluated in the context of population data, where the mean PSS is 21.62, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. The available data suggest a tendency towards a lower or median PSS score. While the participant reports moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D score), their self-esteem is high, and they report low trait anxiety. The PSQI indicates disturbed sleep, but median sleep duration is adequate. Behavioral patterns such as high internet usage and prolonged sedentary hobbies could contribute to stress, but the weak correlations with PSS do not strongly support this. Physiologically, the blunted mesor and reduced amplitude, along with higher intraday variability, could indicate physiological dysregulation associated with stress, however, these metrics do not have strong negative correlations with the PSS score. The elevated mean daily naps, while potentially indicative of fatigue or stress, also show a modest positive correlation with PSS. Considering the overall evidence, particularly the higher self-esteem and lower trait anxiety in contrast to the physiological markers, it is plausible that the participant's PSS score falls within the lower to median range of the study population.

36117,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics that warrant a multimodal analysis in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported survey data reveal a moderate burden of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 16.0, which falls slightly above the population mean. While the STAI-Trait score suggests a lower-than-average proneness to chronic anxiety, this is counterbalanced by elevated scores in subjective happiness and general trust, with Z-scores of 1.64 and 1.79, respectively. Self-esteem appears to be within the typical range, with a score of 45.0. Notably, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 8.0, exceeding the commonly accepted threshold for significant sleep disturbance and having a positive Z-score of 0.59, suggesting a tendency towards poorer sleep quality compared to the study population. Health satisfaction is reported as slightly below average.

Behavioral patterns indicate a significant engagement with sedentary activities, particularly internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and other sedentary hobbies (Z-score 3.19), each exceeding four hours daily. Socializing with friends is also a highly prioritized activity, with a substantial time commitment (Z-score 2.53). Conversely, solitary exercise and participation in sports are infrequent, with low Z-scores reflecting minimal engagement in these areas. Physical activity with others occurs with a notable frequency, aligning with a positive Z-score. Substance usage, including beer and wine/liquor, is reported at a moderate frequency (1-2 times a month), with Z-scores close to the population average.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.65), suggesting a potentially higher physiological arousal baseline. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a strong regularity in the heart rate pattern, as evidenced by a high Mesor (Z-score 2.04) and Amplitude (Z-score 1.58), suggesting a well-defined daily physiological cycle. However, the Intradaily Variability is notably low (Z-score -1.94), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which could be indicative of a less dynamic physiological response. The Acrophase, occurring at 5:06 PM, suggests the peak of this physiological rhythm. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is slightly above average for the population, but the distribution of sleep start times shows some variability.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate deviations from the Mesor during the late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., 2 AM to 7 AM), with increasingly negative deviations. This pattern suggests a period of reduced physiological activity during typical sleep hours. Conversely, during the late afternoon and evening, specifically from 6 PM to 10 PM, heart rate deviations from the Mesor are consistently positive and notably elevated, reaching peaks between 7 PM and 9 PM. This suggests heightened physiological arousal during these periods, which may coincide with waking activities or the aftermath of sedentary periods.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the **bottom_50** of the study population distribution. While several factors, such as elevated depressive symptomology (CES-D), disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), and a higher resting heart rate, might suggest increased stress, these are somewhat counterbalanced by other indicators. The participant reports lower-than-average trait anxiety (STAI), higher happiness and trust, and relatively consistent sleep duration. The high Mesor and Amplitude of their circadian rhythm, coupled with low Intradaily Variability, suggest a stable, albeit potentially less responsive, physiological system. The correlation coefficients, while not overriding the holistic analysis, generally show weak to moderate relationships with the PSS score. The positive correlations with CES-D and resting heart rate, and negative correlations with happiness and self-esteem, are indicative of potential stress, but do not overwhelmingly point to the top tier of perceived stress within the study population, especially when considered alongside the positive indicators and the median PSS score of 22.0. The overall profile suggests a person managing stress, rather than experiencing it at a level that places them in the top 50% of the study population.

In terms of psychological indicators, their scores on the CES-D (4.0) and STAI (36.0) suggest a lower than average level of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, respectively, with Z-scores of -0.97 and -0.52. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is at a moderate level (41.0) with a Z-score of 0.4, indicating a slightly higher than average self-worth within the study population. Notably, self-reported happiness is relatively high (5.0) with a Z-score of 1.64. Health satisfaction is also moderate (3.22, Z-score -0.78), and trust in others is above average (3.67, Z-score 0.83). Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification with a score of 6.0 (Z-score -0.33), aligning with a tendency for poorer sleep quality than the average participant.

The participant's behavioral habits indicate moderate engagement in certain activities. They report drinking wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above average (Z-score 0.94). Beer consumption is less frequent (1-2 times a month, Z-score 0.3). Substance use for recreational or non-prescribed drugs is reported as ""Not at all"". Exercise habits are mixed, with infrequent solitary exercise (1-2 times a month, Z-score -0.43) but more regular exercise with others and participation in sports (1-2 times a week for both, Z-scores 0.53 and 0.91, respectively). Daily recreational habits show a significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and moderate internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.49). Time spent listening to music and socializing with friends is also reported as around 31 minutes an hour, while reading is less frequent (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32). They do not engage in video games or sedentary hobbies. Their Body Mass Index (18.99) falls within the underweight category.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data reveal some interesting patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (56.0, Z-score -0.26). Circadian rhythm analysis shows generally stable intraday variability (0.53, Z-score -0.11) and interdaily stability (0.42, Z-score 0.09). The autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately high (0.41, Z-score 0.73), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. The mesor (72.24, Z-score -0.23) and amplitude (9.67, Z-score -0.36) of the heart rate rhythm are within the average range. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is at 4:43 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a notable pattern of increased physiological arousal during midday and early afternoon hours (e.g., 12-1pm: 17.66, 1-2pm: 13.89, 2-3pm: 13.49), which is a departure from the typical decrease in heart rate during those periods. Conversely, late evening and early morning hours show deviations that are generally lower than the mesor. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is significantly shorter than average (Z-score -1.58). The median sleep start time is very late (02:57:29), with a high standard deviation for sleep start time (Z-score 0.59), suggesting irregular sleep timing. The standard deviation of sleep duration is within the average range (94 minutes, Z-score -0.16).

Considering the available data, particularly the significantly shorter than average sleep duration and irregular sleep timing, alongside a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, these factors suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. While self-reported anxiety and depression are low, the physiological markers of sleep disruption are strong indicators. The population PSS mean is 21.62 with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. The participant's reported PSS score is not provided, so we must infer based on associated variables. The correlation of sleep duration with PSS is -0.05, which is very weak and unlikely to drive the classification. However, the PSQI score's interpretation is ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and while its correlation with PSS is not provided, disturbed sleep is a known correlate of higher stress. Given the substantial deviation from average sleep duration and the late, irregular sleep start times, these are strong indicators of potential stress impacting daily functioning. The elevated heart rate during midday, while not directly correlated with PSS in the provided data, could reflect periods of increased physiological demand or stress response.

The participant's significantly reduced sleep duration (5 hours 55 minutes, Z-score -1.58) and late, variable sleep start times (Median 02:57:29, SD Z-score 0.59) are strong indicators that would likely contribute to a higher perceived stress score. The PSQI score of 6.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" further supports this. While other self-reported psychological measures (CES-D, STAI) indicate low levels of depression and anxiety, and self-esteem and happiness are moderate to high, the physiological and sleep metrics are compelling. Given the population median PSS of 22.0 and 75th percentile of 24.0, and considering the impact of chronic sleep deprivation on stress perception, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score would fall within the upper half of the distribution.

49790,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that inform their perceived stress levels. Self-report measures indicate a generally positive psychological profile, with low scores on the CES-D (3.0) and STAI-Trait (27.0), classifying them as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. This is further supported by a relatively high self-esteem score (46.0), although it should be noted that the Z-score for self-esteem is positive (1.1), suggesting it is above the population mean. Happiness levels are slightly below the population mean (Z-score of -0.53). Despite a slightly below average trust score (Z-score of 1.47 for the inverse of trust, meaning lower trust), and a modest health satisfaction score (Z-score of 1.22), these internal psychological indicators lean towards resilience rather than distress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week) but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits are somewhat mixed; they exercise alone and with others 1-2 times a week, but report no participation in sports. Daily recreational activities are characterized by a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour), a moderate amount of internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score of -1.16), and limited time spent listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading, with a notable absence of dedicated reading time. This pattern suggests a reliance on passive or screen-based leisure activities, potentially at the expense of more active or socially engaging ones.

Physiologically, the participant displays several notable patterns. Their resting heart rate is notably elevated (75.7 bpm, Z-score of 2.09) compared to the study population, indicating a higher baseline cardiovascular arousal. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a high mesor (88.8, Z-score of 2.03), which, in conjunction with the elevated resting heart rate, suggests a generally higher level of physiological activity throughout the day. The acrophase occurring at 6:15 PM points to a late evening peak in this activity. However, the interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm is low (0.25, Z-score of -1.32), indicating a lack of regularity in daily physiological patterns. This is further evidenced by a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.14, Z-score of -1.54). The intradaily variability, however, is close to the population average (0.57, Z-score of 0.17). Examining the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, there is a distinct pattern of increased deviation in the late morning and early afternoon hours (e.g., 10-11 am, 11-12 pm, 12-1 pm, 1-2 pm, 2-3 pm), which contrasts with the more pronounced dips during the early morning hours (3-6 am). This pattern might reflect periods of higher perceived effort or arousal during these midday hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 4 minutes, Z-score of 1.1) but also a highly variable sleep start time (standard deviation of 169 minutes, Z-score of 1.89). This suggests that while the participant obtains sufficient sleep, its timing is inconsistent, which can contribute to disruption of circadian regulation and potentially impact perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, classifying sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" aligns with the observed variability in sleep start times and indicates subjective dissatisfaction with sleep quality.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score relative to the study population, we will examine evidence for both lower and higher perceived stress.

Evidence for a potentially lower or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) comes from several self-report measures. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0) and trait anxiety (STAI-Trait score of 27.0), both of which are significantly below population averages. Their self-esteem is relatively high (score of 46.0), and happiness is only slightly below the mean. They also report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Furthermore, their GPA, despite fluctuations, remains relatively strong across semesters.

Conversely, several indicators suggest potential for higher perceived stress (top 50th percentile). Their resting heart rate is notably elevated (75.7 bpm, Z-score of 2.09), and their mesor is also significantly higher than the population average (88.8, Z-score of 2.03), indicating a generally higher level of physiological arousal that can be indicative of stress. The low interdaily stability (0.25, Z-score of -1.32) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.14, Z-score of -1.54) in their heart rate rhythm suggest a lack of regularity, which can be a consequence of or contributor to stress. Their sleep start time is highly variable (standard deviation of 169 minutes, Z-score of 1.89), and their PSQI score classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" These factors often correlate with higher perceived stress. Additionally, the participant spends a considerable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies and reports relatively low engagement in more active forms of recreation or sports, which could be a coping mechanism for stress or an indicator of reduced capacity for stress-reducing activities. The correlation between the PSS score and some of these metrics, while not overriding the holistic analysis, can provide further context. For instance, higher resting heart rate and sleep start time variability have moderate positive correlations with PSS, while lower interdaily stability has a moderate negative correlation.

Holistically analyzing the evidence, the elevated physiological markers (resting heart rate, mesor), the disrupted sleep patterns (highly variable start time, disturbed quality), and the lack of circadian rhythm regularity collectively point towards a significant degree of underlying physiological strain and potential stress. While psychological self-reports are generally positive, the objective physiological and sleep data suggest a system under more pressure than might be indicated by subjective measures alone. The positive correlations with metrics often associated with stress, such as resting heart rate and sleep variability, further support this. Therefore, it is more likely that the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population.

78657,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"This participant exhibits a range of psychological and behavioral characteristics that offer insight into their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicates a relatively low propensity for depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.14) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.33), as well as a moderate level of self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 0.11). Their reported happiness is below the population mean (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: 0.13), aligning with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is below the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -0.85). This shorter sleep duration is associated with a slight negative correlation with perceived stress.

Behaviorally, this individual reports engaging in moderate levels of alcohol consumption (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94) and abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drugs. They demonstrate a commitment to exercise, with a high frequency of exercising alone and with others (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07, Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23), suggesting a proactive approach to physical well-being. However, leisure time is heavily allocated to video games (Video Games Z-score: 1.71) and listening to music (Listening to Music Z-score: 1.6), which may indicate a tendency towards more passive or solitary forms of recreation. Internet usage and socializing with friends fall within the average range.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.56) and a correspondingly lower mesor (Mesor Z-score: -0.7), suggesting a generally lower basal physiological arousal. However, the diurnal heart rate pattern displays notable variability, with significant positive deviations from the mesor during late evening hours (e.g., 7-8pm: Z-score 1.53, 9-10pm: Z-score 0.64, 10-11pm: Z-score 0.91) and the early morning hours (1-2am: Z-score 1.58, 2-3am: Z-score 0.75). This pattern suggests potential disturbances in the typical diurnal cardiovascular rhythm. The intradaily variability of heart rate is elevated (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.88), while interdaily stability is reduced (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.82), indicating less consistent daily patterns in physiological activity. The acrophase, representing the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 6:50 PM. Sleep onset timing is highly variable (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: 0.88), further contributing to a less structured daily routine.

Considering the available evidence, the participant's lower-than-average resting heart rate, low anxiety and depressive symptom scores, and relatively high self-esteem suggest a baseline that may lean towards lower perceived stress. However, the disturbed subjective sleep quality, consistently shorter sleep duration, high variability in sleep onset, and marked disruptions in diurnal heart rate patterns, particularly during late evening and early morning, point towards factors that could contribute to elevated stress. The strong positive correlations between certain late-night heart rate deviations and PSS score (e.g., 7-8pm: -0.16, 9-10pm: -0.04, 10-11pm: -0.15) are notably negative, which is counterintuitive for stress elevation. Conversely, early morning deviations show positive correlations (e.g., 2-3am: 0.14, 3-4am: 0.19, 4-5am: 0.20, 5-6am: 0.22, 6-7am: 0.19), suggesting that heightened physiological activity during the pre-waking hours is associated with increased perceived stress. Despite the positive psychological indicators, the physiological and sleep irregularities are significant. Given that the population median PSS is 22.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, and considering the presence of several physiological markers indicative of stress (elevated intradaily variability, reduced interdaily stability, disrupted diurnal heart rate) alongside sleep disturbances, it is plausible that this participant's perceived stress level is closer to the upper half of the distribution.

48154,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant's self-reported data reveals several psychological and behavioral characteristics that may inform their perceived stress levels. They report low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0, Z-score of -1.07) and are classified as ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score of 30.0, Z-score of -1.12). This suggests a generally stable emotional baseline. Their self-esteem is relatively high (score of 50.0, Z-score of 1.66), and they report higher than average happiness (current score of 5.0, Z-score of 1.64). Health satisfaction is also above average (score of 4.89, Z-score of 0.47). The participant exhibits moderate trust in others (score of 3.67, Z-score of 0.83). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 5.0 (Z-score of -0.8), which is within a range not typically indicative of significant disturbance. Academic performance is strong, with GPAs consistently above 3.4.

In terms of lifestyle habits, the participant reports moderate substance usage, drinking wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, and beer 1-2 times a month, with lower than average use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs. They engage in regular exercise, working out alone three times a week or more, and participating in sports 1-2 times a week, though they exercise with others infrequently. Their daily recreational habits involve moderate internet usage (2-3 hours) and socializing with friends for 1-2 hours. They report minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, and do not engage in video games, reading, or sedentary hobbies.

The wearable-derived physiological data indicates a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.26, Z-score -1.23) is low, suggesting less regularity in daily activity patterns, which is somewhat contradicted by a moderate Intradaily Variability (0.56, Z-score 0.1) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.3, Z-score -0.19). The Mesor (68.26, Z-score -0.78) and Amplitude (8.57, Z-score -0.71) of their heart rate rhythm are below population averages. Their resting heart rate is also slightly below average (56.0, Z-score -0.26). The hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show notable increases during the late morning and evening hours (e.g., 9-10 AM, 4-5 PM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM), with the most pronounced positive deviation occurring between 5-6 PM (18.24, Z-score 1.13). Conversely, there are significant dips in heart rate deviation during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), suggesting periods of lower physiological arousal during these times. Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score 1.08), with good consistency in sleep duration (standard deviation of 64 minutes, Z-score -0.85). However, their median sleep start time is late, at 01:03 AM, with moderate variability. There are no reported daily naps.

Overall, the participant presents with a profile characterized by low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem and happiness, good perceived health, and strong academic performance. Their lifestyle habits include moderate substance use and regular physical activity. Physiologically, they exhibit a below-average resting heart rate and a circadian rhythm with increased activity in the late afternoon/early evening. While their sleep duration is ample, their sleep start time is late. The low Interdaily Stability might indicate some irregularity in daily routines, which could be a factor in perceived stress, although other indicators do not strongly suggest elevated stress.

The participant's data does not strongly indicate a high perceived stress level. Their low scores on anxiety and depression measures, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, suggest a generally resilient psychological state. The positive correlations of these measures with PSS score (though not provided for PSS itself, these are good proxies) would lean towards a lower PSS. Their good sleep quality and duration, as well as strong academic performance, are also typically associated with lower stress. While some physiological indicators like the elevated heart rate deviation in the late afternoon/early evening and the late sleep start time could potentially be linked to stress, they are not overwhelmingly indicative of significant distress in the context of the other data. The negative correlations of several positive psychological indicators (SelfEsteem, Happy, Reading time, Sports Frequency) with their respective scores are suggestive that higher scores in these areas correspond to lower PSS. Therefore, the available evidence suggests the participant likely has a PSS score in the bottom half of the study population.

21793,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological and behavioral data with objective wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics to interpret perceived stress levels. The participant exhibits a mixed profile of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that warrant examination in relation to their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. Self-reported measures indicate a slight elevation in depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 0.18) and a classification of being ""anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (Z-score: 0.17), suggesting a propensity for higher anxiety. Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within a normative range, with a slight negative Z-score (-0.17). The participant reports significant sleep disturbances, as indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0, placing them above the commonly accepted threshold for clinically significant sleep issues and with a notable Z-score of 1.05, correlating negatively with perceived stress. Behavioral patterns reveal a moderate engagement in substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a month, and no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are less frequent, with individual exercise occurring 1-2 times a week and exercise with others or sports occurring 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational habits show a substantial allocation of time to listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score: 1.6) and watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64), while reading is notably absent (Z-score: -0.67).

Physiological data from the wearable device reveals several noteworthy patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm metrics show reduced regularity, evidenced by a low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.17, Z-score: -1.98) and a high Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.68, Z-score: 0.95), suggesting a less structured daily physiological cycle. The Mesor (Value: 65.7, Z-score: -1.13) and Amplitude (Value: 6.5, Z-score: -1.38) of their heart rate rhythm are also below average for the population. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -1.29), and a significantly later median sleep start time (03:36:45) with a greater standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score: 1.04), contributing to the observed sleep disturbance. The mean daily naps are elevated (Value: 0.33, Z-score: 3.05), suggesting potential daytime sleepiness. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the Mesor indicates pronounced fluctuations throughout the day, with notable increases in deviation during early morning hours (1-5 AM), a pattern that may reflect disturbed sleep or physiological responses to circadian misalignment. Higher deviations are also observed in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 3-4 PM, 7-8 PM), which could be indicative of periods of heightened physiological arousal or stress response. Resting heart rate is within the lower end of the population distribution (Z-score: -0.47).

Considering the provided population PSS data, the mean PSS score is 21.6, with a median of 22.0. This participant's data suggests they are likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution for their PSS score. While there are indicators of heightened anxiety and disrupted sleep (STAI, PSQI), these are offset by several factors that typically correlate with lower stress. The participant exhibits higher-than-average self-esteem (Z-score: -0.17), a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.47), and a generally lower Mesor and Amplitude in their heart rate rhythm, suggesting a lower physiological stress load on average. The negative correlations with perceived stress for some key metrics, such as Self-Esteem (r = -0.15), Trust (r = -0.04), Happiness (r = -0.19), and Reading time (r = -0.21), further support a lower perceived stress score. Although sleep duration is reduced, the overall sleep start time variability and the presence of elevated anxiety traits and depressive symptoms are concerning, they do not appear to be the dominant drivers pushing the PSS score into the higher percentile range when considering the totality of the data. The relatively low Mesor and Amplitude of heart rate, combined with higher self-esteem and trust scores, suggest a resilience that may buffer against higher perceived stress. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the participant's PSS score would likely fall within the bottom 50% of the distribution.

37218,14.0,0.031088082901554404,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a complex profile with notable indicators of elevated stress, anxiety, and disturbed sleep, alongside generally healthy lifestyle behaviors. Self-reported data reveals high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 24.0, Z-score 1.11) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 49.0, Z-score 0.76). These findings are corroborated by a significantly high PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), indicating disturbed sleep quality, which is often co-occurring with heightened stress and negative affect. Despite these internal distress indicators, the participant reports relatively low overall happiness (Z-score -1.61) and lower than average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95). Self-esteem appears to be within a healthier range (RSES score of 29.0, Z-score -1.29). Behavioral patterns suggest a strong engagement with sedentary leisure activities, particularly listening to music for extended periods (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and significant time spent socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74) and watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28). Notably, the participant reports no substance usage and infrequent engagement in solitary or group exercise, with sports being the only reported activity with moderate frequency.

Physiological data from the wearable offers further insight into the participant's stress response and circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively regular rhythm, evidenced by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.58 and an Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score of 0.31, suggesting a consistent daily cycle. However, the Amplitude Z-score of -0.63 indicates a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the average. The Mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.3), and the Resting Heart Rate is also within a normal, though slightly elevated range (Z-score 0.34). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late evening and early morning hours. High positive deviations are observed from 9 PM to 11 PM (Z-scores 1.20 and 1.06 respectively), and also from 12 AM to 2 AM (Z-scores 1.25 and 1.67). Conversely, substantial negative deviations, indicative of lower than usual heart rate activity for those times, are present during the pre-dawn hours, from 2 AM to 7 AM, with the most pronounced being at 5 AM and 6 AM (Z-scores 0.2 and 0.22 respectively, though these are negative deviations from the mesor). These patterns suggest a disruption in the typical diurnal heart rate variation, potentially reflecting periods of heightened physiological arousal during the night, contributing to the reported sleep disturbances. The median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours (Z-score -1.45) is notably shorter than average, further supporting the conclusion of poor sleep.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the available data, there is substantial evidence pointing towards an elevated perceived stress level for this participant, suggesting a PSS score likely falling within the top 50% of the study population. The self-report survey data indicates significant distress, with elevated scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and chronic anxiety (STAI). These psychological indicators are strongly associated with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality, as evidenced by a high PSQI score, which is a common consequence of and contributor to elevated stress. While the participant's self-esteem is within a healthier range and their GPA is strong, these protective factors do not appear to fully mitigate the underlying distress.

The physiological data further supports the interpretation of elevated stress. The pattern of heart rate deviation from the mesor shows heightened arousal during late evening and early morning hours, periods often associated with attempts to rest and recover. This disrupted physiological activity, coupled with a shorter than average sleep duration, is indicative of a system under strain. The moderate interdaily stability and autocorrelation suggest some level of circadian regulation, but the pronounced deviations during key rest periods point to stress-related physiological dysregulation. Considering the constellation of high anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep, and physiological markers of arousal during rest, it is highly probable that this participant experiences a level of perceived stress that places them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

17932,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant presents a complex profile with several notable characteristics that may inform their perceived stress levels. Self-report measures indicate generally positive psychological traits. Specifically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -0.14) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score = -0.62), falling within or below the typical range for the study population. Self-esteem is notably high (SelfEsteem Z-score = 0.82), aligning with greater self-worth. Similarly, reported happiness is above average (Happy Z-score = -0.53), and trust in others is lower than average (Trust Z-score = -1.1). Health satisfaction is also high (Health Satisfaction Z-score = 0.97).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular physical activity, exercising alone three or more times a week (Exercised Alone Z-score = 1.07) and with others or sports 1-2 times a week. Substance usage, including beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily habits show significant time spent on video games (Video Games Z-score = 2.47), with moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies and socializing with friends. Internet usage and listening to music are below average, while reading and sedentary hobbies are also engaged in.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a robust and regular circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability of their heart rate is high (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 1.08), suggesting a consistent daily pattern. Conversely, intradaily variability is low (Intradaily Variability Z-score = -1.24), indicating stable heart rate fluctuations throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score = 1.65), further supporting strong circadian regularity. The participant's mesor (average heart rate around the rhythm) is below average (Mesor Z-score = -1.01), and their resting heart rate is also low (Resting Heart Rate Z-score = -1.13), suggesting good cardiovascular health. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is above average (Amplitude Z-score = 0.59). Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score = 1.74), though sleep start times show considerable variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.66), with a median start time of 01:23 AM. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is notably high (PSQI Z-Score = 2.9), classifying as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" which contradicts the objectively measured longer sleep duration and suggests a subjective discrepancy in sleep quality.

The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct patterns. There is a marked dip in heart rate during the early morning hours (3-7 AM), with deviations ranging from -25.43% to -23.03% from the mesor. Heart rate begins to increase in the late morning and afternoon, peaking around 11 AM-12 PM with a positive deviation of 18.63%. Heart rate then remains elevated throughout the evening, with consistent positive deviations between 7 PM and 10 PM, reaching 14.79% deviation at 7-8 PM and 14.05% at 9-10 PM. These patterns suggest a period of low physiological arousal during early sleep and a sustained higher level of arousal throughout waking hours, particularly in the evening.

The correlation between Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and various metrics provides further context. While many correlations are weak and non-significant, a few warrant attention. Higher PSS scores are weakly associated with greater depressive symptoms (CES-D correlation = 0.28) and anxiety proneness (STAI correlation = 0.31). There is a slight negative correlation with self-esteem (SelfEsteem correlation = -0.15), happiness (Happy correlation = -0.19), and reading habits (Reading correlation = -0.21). Notably, there are positive correlations between PSS and sleep disturbance metrics, specifically with the lowest deviations from mesor in the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM correlation = 0.19, 5-6 AM correlation = 0.21, 6-7 AM correlation = 0.19) and with high intradaily variability of heart rate (Intradaily Variability correlation = 0.16). The strong indicator of disturbed sleep from the PSQI (Z-score = 2.9) alongside these correlations suggests that subjective sleep quality and its impact on early morning physiological states might be contributing factors to perceived stress.

Considering the overall data, the participant reports generally positive psychological well-being, good academic performance, and engaged in healthy behaviors such as regular exercise. However, the significantly elevated PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, coupled with the higher-than-average positive deviation of heart rate from mesor during evening hours and negative deviations during early morning sleep, points towards potential physiological dysregulation impacting their perceived stress. The positive correlations between PSS and indicators of sleep disturbance and physiological arousal during sleep suggest that these factors, rather than underlying psychological traits, may be driving higher stress levels. Given the population mean PSS of 21.62 and a 50th percentile of 22.0, and considering the indicators of disturbed sleep and associated physiological patterns, it is plausible that this participant's perceived stress falls within the upper half of the distribution.

81420,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral indicators that may influence or reflect perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 25.0, Z-score of 1.22) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score of 0.86). While self-esteem is within a moderate range (RSES score of 31.0, Z-score of -1.01, indicating above-average self-esteem), and trust in others is also slightly above average (Trust score of 3.0, Z-score of -0.46), these positive traits are offset by a lower than average self-reported happiness (Happy score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55, where higher values indicate greater happiness) and lower than average satisfaction with physical health (Health Satisfaction score of 2.78, Z-score of -1.11). Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as disturbed (PSQI score of 8.0, Z-score of 0.59), which is consistent with the median sleep start time being quite late at approximately 2:40 AM. The duration of sleep is close to the population average (Median Sleep Duration of 7 hours 12 minutes, Z-score of 0.02).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer consumption reported as 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 1.01). Exercise habits are relatively active, with solo exercise occurring three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07) and exercise with others and sports participation occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational activities show a notable tendency towards reading (Time: 16-30 minutes, Z-score of 1.3, with a negative correlation to PSS), while video game usage is also moderately high (Time: 16-30 minutes, Z-score of 0.96). Internet usage is reported as lower than average (Time: 16-30 minutes, Z-score of -1.16).

Physiologically, the wearable data suggests a circadian rhythm that deviates from typical patterns. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated relative to the population (Mesor Z-score of 0.6), and the resting heart rate is also above average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 0.53). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average (Amplitude Z-score of -0.74), suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Value: 0.29, Z-score of -0.99), indicating irregular daily patterns, further supported by high intradaily variability (Value: 0.31, Z-score of -1.66), which is unexpected given the low stability. The acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is recorded at 5:52 PM. Analysis of the hourly deviation from the mesor reveals pronounced periods of elevated heart rate during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM, 4-5 PM, 5-6 PM), with a notable dip during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-6 AM). This pattern, coupled with a late sleep start time, suggests a disruption in regular diurnal activity and physiological patterning.

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported data indicates elevated levels of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, which are often correlated with higher perceived stress. While self-esteem, trust, and health satisfaction are somewhat mixed, the presence of significant psychological distress markers suggests a higher propensity for perceived stress. The PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" further supports this, as poor sleep quality is a known contributor to stress. Behaviorally, the active exercise habits and moderate social engagement are positive but do not negate the psychological indicators.

Physiologically, the irregular interdaily stability and high intradaily variability of heart rate, combined with an above-average mesor and resting heart rate, point to a system that may be under strain. The late sleep start time and the pattern of heart rate deviations throughout the day suggest a disrupted diurnal cycle, which can exacerbate perceived stress.

Considering the combination of elevated anxiety and depressive symptom scores, disturbed sleep, and physiological irregularities, it is likely that this participant experiences a level of perceived stress that places them in the upper half of the study population distribution. The positive correlations with PSS for CES-D and STAI further strengthen this assertion.

67709,26.0,0.927461139896373,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics that inform an understanding of their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicates elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of 1.63, classification: Depressed) and moderate chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of 0.46, classification: anxious). Conversely, self-esteem is relatively lower than the study population (SelfEsteem Z-score of -0.73), and self-reported happiness is also somewhat below average (Happy Z-score of 0.55, indicating lower happiness in this context). Academic performance shows a notable decline from previous semesters, with a significant drop in the Fall 2016 GPA (2.13) compared to prior years. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, suggests disturbed sleep patterns (PSQI Z-score of -0.33, classification: Disturbed Sleep). Behavioral patterns reveal a preference for passive leisure activities, with high internet usage (Z-score of 1.52) and moderate listening to music (Z-score of 1.13), while actively avoiding substance use and formal sports. Notably, this participant exercises with others more frequently (Z-score of 1.23) than the average, but not alone.

From a physiological perspective, the wearable data suggests potential underlying dysregulation in circadian rhythms and cardiovascular activity. The Mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is lower than the population average (Mesor Z-score of -0.83), suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is higher (Amplitude Z-score of 0.27), indicating larger swings in heart rate throughout the day, which could reflect periods of heightened physiological response. Interdaily stability of heart rate is lower than average (Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.24), suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns. Intradaily variability is also lower (Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.6), which is counterintuitive given the higher amplitude and could indicate prolonged periods of low or stable heart rate interspersed with acute spikes. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm occurs in the evening (6:15 PM), which is within a typical range, but the aggregated hourly deviations from the Mesor reveal significant deviations during specific periods. Notably, there is a substantial positive deviation during the late afternoon and early evening (5-6 PM, Z-score 2.76; 6-7 PM, Z-score 1.24), indicating significantly elevated heart rate during these times, possibly reflecting physiological responses to stress or activity. Conversely, there are substantial negative deviations during the early morning hours (3-4 AM, Z-score 0.18; 4-5 AM, Z-score 0.92; 5-6 AM, Z-score 0.21; 6-7 AM, Z-score -0.33; 7-8 AM, Z-score -0.77; 8-9 AM, Z-score -1.05; 9-10 AM, Z-score -1.94), suggesting periods of unusually low heart rate during what is typically a more active part of the day. Sleep statistics indicate longer than average sleep durations (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of 1.34) but with considerable variability (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of 1.65), and a late median sleep start time (03:45:29) with moderate variability in sleep start times. This combination of extended but variable sleep, late start times, and disturbed subjective quality, alongside physiological indicators of dysregulated circadian rhythm and elevated evening heart rate, are all relevant to perceived stress.

Based on a holistic evaluation of the provided data, the participant's characteristics suggest a profile associated with higher perceived stress, placing them within the top 50% of the study population. The elevated CES-D score, indicating a burden of depressive symptoms, and the classification of anxiousness from the STAI, are direct indicators of psychological distress. The observed decline in GPA, particularly the significant drop in Fall 2016, is a strong external correlate of increased academic pressure and potential stress. Furthermore, the PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" and the wearable data showing longer but highly variable sleep durations and a late sleep start time point to underlying sleep dysregulation, a common consequence and contributor to stress. The physiological data, while complex, includes periods of significantly elevated heart rate during late afternoon and early evening, which could reflect a heightened stress response. The lower interdaily stability of heart rate also suggests a less regulated physiological system. While some metrics like lower Mesor and resting heart rate might typically be associated with lower stress, in conjunction with the other indicators, they might reflect a state of physiological exhaustion or chronic stress response where the body struggles to maintain consistent regulation. The negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with PSS score (though small in magnitude) further align with a profile experiencing higher stress. Overall, the convergence of psychological distress indicators, academic challenges, sleep disturbances, and physiological patterns indicative of dysregulation points towards a higher perceived stress level.

36552,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant presents with a multifaceted profile that warrants a detailed examination of their psychological state and behavioral patterns in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported survey data indicate moderate levels of trait anxiety, with a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 44.0, which falls within the 'anxious' classification and has a slightly positive correlation with PSS. While depressive symptoms, assessed by the CES-D scale, are within the 'not depressed' range with a score of 10.0 and a negative Z-score, suggesting lower than average symptom burden, the moderate anxiety proneness is a notable factor. Self-esteem is at the higher end of the scale, with a score of 40.0, indicating high self-worth and a slightly negative correlation with PSS. Health satisfaction is also relatively high, with a score of 5.0 and a negative correlation with PSS. Trust in others is at a slightly above-average level, with a score of 3.33 and a negligible correlation with PSS. Happiness is reported at a below-average level, indicated by a current score of 3.0 and a negative correlation with PSS. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as 'Disturbed Sleep' with a score of 7.0, slightly above the general threshold for concern and a negligible correlation with PSS.

Behaviorally, this participant exhibits a pattern of generally low engagement in substance use, with frequencies of beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs all reported as 'Less than 1-2 times a month' or 'Not at all,' and these generally show small negative correlations with PSS. Physical activity engagement is a mixed picture: while exercising alone is frequent ('Three times a week or more'), reflecting a strong positive Z-score, engagement in exercising with others and sports is infrequent ('Less than 1-2 times a month'). The correlation of these activities with PSS is minimal. In terms of daily recreational habits, the participant spends a considerable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies and using the internet (both approximately 31 minutes an hour), with the former having a positive correlation and the latter a slightly positive correlation with PSS. They engage in listening to music for a moderate duration (16-30 minutes) and socializing with friends for approximately 31 minutes an hour, both showing negligible correlations with PSS. Reading time is relatively short ('15 minutes or less'), with a notable negative correlation with PSS, suggesting higher engagement in reading is associated with lower perceived stress. Video game usage is reported as 'Do not do,' with a negative correlation with PSS, and sedentary hobbies are also engaged in minimally ('15 minutes or less'), with a negative correlation.

Physiologically, derived from wearable data, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics indicate some disruption. Their interdaily stability (IS) is notably low at 0.29, with a significant negative Z-score of -0.99, suggesting a lack of regularity in daily activity patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability (IV) is high at 0.72, with a positive Z-score of 1.23, indicating frequent fluctuations in activity throughout the day. The mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) is close to the population average, and the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is relatively low, suggesting a reduced overall daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:02 PM). Their resting heart rate is above average, with a Z-score of 0.73. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals elevated deviations from the mesor during specific periods, particularly during the late night and early morning hours (3-7 AM), with the most pronounced positive deviation observed between 3-4 PM (19.92), correlating slightly with PSS. Conversely, late evening and early morning hours (7-8 PM and 12-1 PM) show significant negative deviations from the mesor. Sleep statistics indicate shorter than average sleep durations, with a median of 6 hours and 23 minutes, and a standard deviation for sleep duration and sleep start time that are both on the lower side, implying less variability but also insufficient sleep. The Z-score for median sleep duration is notably low (-1.0), suggesting consistently short sleep.

Considering the data holistically, several factors suggest a higher perceived stress level. The presence of moderate trait anxiety, disturbed sleep quality, and below-average reported happiness are all indicators. The irregular daily activity patterns, as evidenced by low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability, can be indicative of stress-related disorganization. While many behavioral habits like substance use are low and high self-esteem and health satisfaction are positive, the combination of anxiety, poor sleep, and a lack of daily structure points towards elevated stress. The specific patterns in aggregated hourly heart rate deviations, particularly the early morning elevations, coupled with consistently short sleep durations, further contribute to this interpretation. The positive correlation between STAI scores and PSS, as well as the negative correlation between reading time and PSS, align with this. Although the PSS population mean is 21.61 and the 50th percentile is 22.0, this participant's profile suggests they may experience stress at levels that place them in the upper half of the distribution.

63138,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral factors that may influence perceived stress. Self-report data indicate a generally low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.55) and a moderate level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.13), which is slightly below the population average. Self-esteem is also near the population average (SelfEsteem Z-score: -0.03), and their self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy Z-score: 0.55). Trust in others is notably higher than average (Trust Z-score: 0.5). Health satisfaction is also above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.38).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, which is above the population average in terms of frequency (Beer Z-score: 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). They report no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels appear to be relatively low, with exercise occurring less than 1-2 times a month (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.18), and sports participation at 1-2 times a month (Sports Z-score: 0.25). Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.49), socialising with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.62), and listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.72). They report minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and reading, with reading being a notably absent habit (Reading Z-score: -0.67).

Wearable data reveals some notable physiological and circadian rhythm patterns. The interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly above average (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.17), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns. However, intradaily variability is significantly higher than average (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.16), indicating more fluctuation in heart rate within a day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also elevated (Amplitude Z-score: 0.88), suggesting larger swings in heart rate throughout the day. The mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly above average (Mesor Z-score: 0.44), and the resting heart rate is also higher than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.56). The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (5:09 PM). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates elevated heart rates during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score: 1.10; 5-6 PM, Z-score: 0.77), and significantly lower heart rates during the early morning hours.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 21 minutes, Z-score: 1.45), but with a standard deviation that suggests some variability in nightly sleep duration (66 minutes, Z-score: -0.8). The median sleep start time is late (1:37 AM), and the standard deviation of sleep start times is moderate, suggesting some consistency in the late sleep onset. There are no recorded naps.

Considering the data in relation to the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population means (Mean: 21.61, 50th percentile: 22.0), this participant exhibits several indicators that might contribute to elevated perceived stress, despite some positive self-report measures. The higher intradaily variability and amplitude in heart rate suggest a physiological system that may be more reactive. Higher resting heart rate also points towards a potentially heightened physiological arousal state. The moderate substance use, particularly the frequency of alcohol consumption, could be an indicator of stress coping mechanisms. While self-reported anxiety is not extremely high, the correlation between STAI and PSS is moderately positive (0.31). The low frequency of exercise and sedentary recreational habits, particularly reading, may also contribute to less effective stress management. The positive correlation between Intradaily Variability and PSS (0.16) and Amplitude and PSS (-0.17) are noteworthy. Conversely, higher trust, self-esteem, and happiness could act as buffers against stress. The longer sleep duration is a positive factor, though the variability in sleep start time could be a mild detractor.

Given the confluence of factors such as elevated physiological arousal indicated by heart rate variability and amplitude, moderate substance use, and lower physical activity, alongside a moderate level of trait anxiety, it is likely that this participant’s perceived stress level falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

16654,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant presents a complex profile with several factors potentially influencing perceived stress. Self-report data indicates low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.38) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -0.72). Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 39.0 on a 10-40 scale, placing it near the upper limit and resulting in a Z-score of 0.11, indicating it is slightly above the population mean. Similarly, self-reported happiness is relatively low (Z-score: -0.53). Health satisfaction is significantly higher than average, with a Z-score of 1.3. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.33, suggesting it is slightly better than the population average in terms of perceived sleep quality. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is strong and has been improving over the observed semesters.

Behavioral habits reveal a moderate consumption of alcohol (Beer and Wine/Liquor usage is 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), but no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise patterns show consistent engagement, with exercising alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32) and with others three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.23), alongside sports participation 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91). Daily recreational activities are relatively balanced, with moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-score: 0.01), video games (15 minutes or less, Z-score: 0.2), and listening to music (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -0.26). Notably, this participant spends a considerable amount of time socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95), while internet usage (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.49) and sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.36) are relatively low. Reading time is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-score: 0.32).

Physiological data from the wearable suggests a robust circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability of heart rate is high (Z-score: 1.08), indicating a regular daily pattern, while intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.24). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also moderately positive (Z-score: 0.56), reinforcing the presence of a stable daily rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate around the rhythm's center) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.57), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is significantly high (Z-score: 1.44), suggesting a greater fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. The acrophase of 5:23 PM indicates the typical peak time for heart rate, which aligns with potential periods of higher activity or stress. Resting heart rate is within the normal range (Z-score: 0.18). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a pattern of lower-than-average heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., 2 AM to 7 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -0.66 to -0.95), consistent with sleep. Heart rate increases throughout the morning and peaks in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 1 PM, 5 PM, 9 PM, 10 PM, 11 PM showing positive deviations).

Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes, which is longer than the population average (Z-score: 0.73). However, the variability in sleep duration is low (Z-score: -1.04), suggesting consistent sleep times. The median sleep start time is relatively late (1:37 AM), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is low (30 minutes, Z-score: -1.17), indicating a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. There are no reported naps.

The participant exhibits generally positive psychological traits such as low anxiety and depression, and high self-esteem. Their academic performance is strong, and they engage in regular exercise and social activities. However, their self-reported happiness is on the lower side, and despite a good overall sleep duration, the PSQI classification suggests subjectively disturbed sleep. The physiological data points towards a well-regulated circadian rhythm with significant heart rate variability, particularly in the afternoon and evening. The correlation data provides some additional context, for instance, the moderate positive correlation between Intradaily Variability of Heart Rate (0.16) and PSS score suggests that greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day may be associated with higher perceived stress. Similarly, the positive correlation between the deviation from mesor during early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM with correlations of 0.19, 0.19, 0.21, 0.19 respectively) and PSS score suggests that experiencing lower heart rates during these early hours may be linked to increased perceived stress. The strong amplitude of heart rate variation (correlation: -0.16) suggests that larger fluctuations in heart rate may be associated with lower perceived stress.

Considering the participant's robust circadian rhythm, strong academic performance, and engagement in social and physical activities, coupled with low scores on anxiety and depression measures, the overall impression is not one of high perceived stress. While there are some indicators that could point towards elevated stress, such as lower self-reported happiness and a tendency for increased heart rate during later parts of the day, these are outweighed by the generally positive psychological profile and healthy lifestyle choices. The average PSS score in the population is 21.62, with a median of 22.0. The participant's generally positive psychological indicators and healthy behaviors suggest their PSS score is likely to be closer to the lower end of the distribution.

29134,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological metrics. Self-reported data indicate a ""not depressed"" classification on the CES-D scale (Z = -0.14) and ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait (Z = -0.33), suggesting a baseline of relatively lower symptom burden in these areas compared to the study population. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z = 0.11), and happiness is also reported at a higher level (Z = 0.55), aligning with a generally positive subjective outlook. However, notable deviations from population norms are observed in sleep quality and substance usage. The PSQI score of 11.0 (Z = 1.98) falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, indicating significant subjective sleep quality issues, and is strongly correlated with poorer sleep outcomes. Regarding substance use, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z = 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z = 0.94), which are above the average usage for the study population. Exercise habits are more robust, with regular engagement in group activities (Exercised with Others: Three times a week or more, Z = 1.23) and sports (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z = 1.58), suggesting a proactive approach to physical activity. Daily recreation includes moderate engagement in reading (1.3 Z-score) and internet usage (0.18 Z-score), while sedentary activities like watching TV/videos and video games are less prominent.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals some intriguing patterns. The circadian rhythm metrics, particularly Interdaily Stability (Z = 0.0) and Intradaily Variability (Z = -0.18), suggest a moderate degree of regularity in daily heart rate patterns, without extreme deviations from the population norm. The mesor (Z = -0.56) and amplitude (Z = -0.51) are below population averages, indicating a lower overall daily heart rate range. The resting heart rate (Z = -0.33) is also below the population mean, suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of lower heart rates in the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -15.81 to -12.69), followed by a gradual increase into the late morning and afternoon, peaking around 12-1 PM with deviations of 14.6. Heart rates then decline in the evening, with a resurgence from 7-8 PM. This pattern, especially the elevated heart rate during the late morning and afternoon, could reflect periods of increased cognitive or physical demand. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 40 minutes (Z = 0.6), which is above average, yet the standard deviation for sleep duration (Z = 1.33) and sleep start time (Z = 2.2) are notably high. This suggests significant variability in sleep patterns, which, when combined with the high PSQI score, reinforces the notion of disrupted sleep despite seemingly adequate duration. The elevated Z-scores for sleep duration and start time standard deviations are particularly salient, suggesting inconsistency in sleep schedules.

The participant's perceived stress level, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), needs to be evaluated in the context of the multimodal data. While self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms are low, the significantly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z = 1.98) and the high variability in sleep duration and start times (Sleep Duration SD Z = 1.33, Sleep Start Time SD Z = 2.2) are strong indicators of potential underlying stress. The PSQI score of 11.0 falls above the population median of 22.0, but importantly, the population's 75th percentile is 24.0, and the median is 22.0. Given the PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a Z-score of 1.98, which is considerably elevated relative to the population, it suggests that this individual experiences significantly poorer sleep than the average participant. This subjective sleep disturbance is a well-established correlate of heightened perceived stress. Furthermore, while not directly measured as a PSS domain, the moderate substance usage (Beer Z = 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z = 0.94) might also serve as coping mechanisms for stress, further implying a level of stress beyond what is captured by low anxiety and depression scores. Although correlations with PSS are not provided for PSQI or sleep variability, the clinical interpretation of these metrics strongly points towards elevated stress. Considering the robust evidence of disturbed sleep and potential reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism, it is reasonable to infer that the participant's perceived stress level is likely in the higher range, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population.

24029,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of behavioral and physiological markers that inform an understanding of their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicate elevated levels of both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 21.0, Z-score of 0.8) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score of 0.86), with a moderate positive correlation with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores. Conversely, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Score of 29.0, Z-score of -1.29), which typically correlates with lower perceived stress, and moderate happiness (Current happiness of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55). Their sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is characterized as disturbed (Score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.33), which is further supported by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes, falling in the lower half of the population distribution (Z-score of -0.52).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle concerning physical activity, engaging in exercise alone and with others, and participating in sports, all three times a week or more, with Z-scores exceeding 1.0 for each category. This is contrasted by significant engagement in sedentary leisure activities, particularly video games (Z-score of 2.47) and listening to music (Z-score of 2.06), indicating a potential imbalance in daily time allocation. Socializing with friends occurs for approximately 31 minutes an hour (Z-score of -0.62), suggesting this is less frequent than other leisure pursuits. Internet usage and reading time are within the population average or slightly below. Notably, substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is a protective factor.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as assessed by Fitbit data, shows moderate stability (Interdaily Stability of 0.42, Z-score of 0.09) but high variability within the day (Intradaily Variability of 0.7, Z-score of 1.09). Their resting heart rate is below the population average (Value of 54.6, Z-score of -0.42), and the Mesor is also slightly lower than average (Value of 72.85, Z-score of -0.15). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor. Notably, there are pronounced periods of lower than expected heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -2.94 to -1.28), potentially indicative of deep sleep or physiological recovery. Conversely, substantial elevations in heart rate are observed during waking hours, particularly from 6-7 AM (Z-score of 4.77), 7-8 AM (Z-score of 2.66), and throughout the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-6 PM, with Z-scores around 1.3-1.4). These elevated heart rate periods during active waking hours, alongside the high intraday variability, may reflect physiological responses to demands or stressors throughout the day, particularly when considered in conjunction with their elevated anxiety and depressive symptom scores.

The analysis of the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score suggests they fall within the top 50% of the study population, indicating a relatively high level of perceived stress. Evidence for this conclusion includes the participant's elevated scores on measures of psychological distress, specifically the CES-D (depressive symptoms) and STAI (chronic anxiety), both of which show moderate positive correlations with PSS. While high self-esteem and happiness are generally associated with lower stress, their presence alongside significant anxiety and depressive symptoms suggests a potential buffering effect that may not fully mitigate the overall stress burden. Furthermore, the participant's disturbed sleep quality (PSQI) and relatively short sleep duration, coupled with high intradaily variability in heart rate, point towards physiological dysregulation that is often co-occurring with elevated stress. The pronounced and frequent elevations in heart rate during waking hours, particularly in the morning and afternoon, could signify consistent physiological activation in response to daily demands. Conversely, evidence for a bottom 50% PSS score is less compelling. While their resting heart rate and Mesor are below average, and they are non-users of substances, these factors do not outweigh the significant indicators of psychological distress and physiological arousal associated with stress. The highly active lifestyle, while beneficial, may also contribute to stress if not balanced with adequate recovery, and the high engagement in sedentary leisure activities like video games could be a coping mechanism or a consequence of elevated stress. Therefore, the confluence of self-reported psychological distress, disrupted sleep, and physiological patterns suggestive of sustained arousal points towards a PSS score likely in the upper half of the distribution.

35361,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by relatively low levels of self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.66) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.33). Self-esteem is slightly above average (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score of 0.26). Subjective sleep quality is reported as good, with a PSQI score of 4.0 and a Z-score of -1.26, suggesting minimal sleep disturbance. Trust in others is also relatively low, with a Z-score of -1.1. Self-reported happiness is moderately above average (Z-score of 0.55), and health satisfaction is also moderately elevated (Z-score of 0.55).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in a moderate amount of exercise, with 'Exercised Alone' occurring three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), and 'Exercised with Others' occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.53). Sports participation is less frequent, occurring 1-2 times a month (Z-score of 0.25). Daily recreational habits indicate lower engagement in passive activities such as 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' (Z-score of -1.25) and 'Internet Usage' (Z-score of -1.16). Conversely, they report spending more time 'Reading' (Z-score of 1.3) and moderate amounts of time on 'Video Games', 'Listening to Music', 'Socializing with Friends', and 'Sedentary Hobby' activities. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, with notably low Z-scores for beer and wine/liquor usage.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm appears moderately regular, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 1.49, suggesting a consistent daily pattern. However, Intradaily Variability is relatively low (Z-score of -1.24), which may reflect less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate rhythm, is below the population mean (Z-score of -0.84). The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average (Z-score of 0.87), suggesting greater variation in heart rate over the 24-hour cycle. The Acrophase, the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:28 PM. The resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score of -0.99).

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern. The participant exhibits significant deviations below the mesor during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-6 AM, with values ranging from -28.41 to -24.54. Heart rate then gradually increases, becoming positive during the late morning and afternoon, peaking between 1-2 PM and 4-5 PM (values of 16.9 and 16.03 respectively). Heart rate deviations decrease in the evening and night, returning to negative values. This pattern suggests a typical circadian-driven heart rate fluctuation, with lower activity during early sleep and higher activity during waking hours, particularly the afternoon.

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.31). The variability in sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score of -0.91), suggesting consistent nightly sleep durations. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:57:45), with moderate variability in sleep start times (Z-score of -0.21). The absence of daily naps (Z-score of -0.86) further supports a consistent sleep pattern.

Correlations with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores are generally weak, with a few notable exceptions. Higher self-reported happiness is moderately negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.19), suggesting happier individuals experience less stress. Reading for pleasure is also negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.21), indicating that this activity may be associated with lower stress. Conversely, Intradaily Variability in heart rate is positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.16), suggesting greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day may be linked to higher perceived stress. Acrophase in the late afternoon (4:28 PM) and higher Mesor amplitude are negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.17 for amplitude), implying these physiological markers might be associated with lower stress. The strongest positive correlation with PSS is observed during the 4-5 AM and 5-6 AM periods for heart rate deviation from the mesor (r = 0.20 and r = 0.21 respectively), and also between 3-4 AM (r = 0.19), suggesting that elevated heart rate during these early morning hours is associated with higher perceived stress.

Considering the overall profile, the participant presents with good mental health indicators (low depression and anxiety, moderate self-esteem) and healthy lifestyle habits (moderate exercise, low substance use, preference for reading over passive screen time). Their sleep is reported as good and shows good regularity. Physiologically, while resting heart rate is lower than average and amplitude is higher, the overall circadian rhythm stability is good. The primary indicators potentially associated with elevated stress are the increased heart rate deviation from mesor during the early morning hours (3-6 AM) and moderate sleep duration. However, the low CES-D and STAI scores, combined with good PSQI and high self-esteem, suggest that these physiological patterns may not translate into significantly elevated perceived stress.

49086,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with notable patterns observed across self-reported traits and wearable-derived metrics. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.28) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02), suggesting a generally stable emotional baseline. Self-esteem is reported at a slightly above-average level (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.1). Subjective happiness is reported slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53), and overall health satisfaction is also moderately below average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.7). Trust in others is slightly above average (Trust Z-score: 0.83). Notably, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), which is consistent with a score above 5, suggesting potential difficulties in subjective sleep quality.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times per week (Z-score: 0.94) and beer 1-2 times a month (Z-score: 0.3), while reporting no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physical activity is notably low, with no reported frequency of exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports (Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.93, Exercised with Others Z-score: -1.58, Sports Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits show a significant time investment in watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.67), with moderate internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.18) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95). Reading and sedentary hobbies are reported for shorter durations.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, indicated by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.16 and an Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.18, suggesting a moderate degree of predictability in daily patterns. The Mesor (average heart rate) is below population average (Mesor Z-score: -0.61), and the Amplitude is also lower than average (Amplitude Z-score: -0.57), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase, representing the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is at 5:43 PM. Resting heart rate is also below average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.22). Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns: significant positive deviations (indicating higher heart rate than expected) are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, Z-score: 1.66; 1-2 AM, Z-score: 1.18), with increasingly negative deviations (lower heart rate) during the early morning to late morning (e.g., 6-7 AM, Z-score: -0.14; 8-9 AM, Z-score: -1.27). A notable shift occurs in the afternoon and evening, with positive deviations re-emerging from 1 PM onwards, peaking between 1-2 PM (Z-score: 0.96).

Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, slightly above the population median (Z-score: 0.15), with a standard deviation of 107 minutes. The median sleep start time is late, at 2:19 AM, with a standard deviation of 78 minutes, suggesting variability in sleep onset. The mean number of daily naps is low (Z-score: -0.08).

Given the participant's low self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, along with average or slightly elevated self-esteem, these factors suggest a lower propensity for high perceived stress. The disturbed sleep quality indicated by the PSQI, however, can be a contributing factor to elevated stress. The low physical activity levels and higher engagement in sedentary recreational activities might also correlate with stress perception. The moderate substance use, particularly wine or liquor, could be a coping mechanism that indirectly influences stress. While physiological measures like Mesor and Amplitude are below average, the hourly heart rate deviations show some periods of elevated arousal, particularly in the late evening and early morning, which could reflect stress responses or disruptions. The correlation data, though not definitive, provides subtle indications. For instance, higher trust correlates negatively with PSS (correlation: -0.04), and higher happiness correlates negatively with PSS (correlation: -0.19), both aligning with lower stress. Conversely, higher Intradaily Variability in heart rate shows a positive correlation with PSS (correlation: 0.16), suggesting that more erratic physiological patterns might be linked to higher stress. However, the overall pattern of low psychological distress indicators outweighs the potential stressors identified, pointing towards a less stressed individual.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50% of the study population distribution. This assessment is primarily based on the exceptionally low scores in self-reported anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02) and depression (CESD Z-score: -1.28), coupled with slightly above-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.1). These psychological indicators are strong predictors of lower perceived stress. While the PSQI score suggests disturbed sleep, which can be associated with stress, it does not singularly indicate high perceived stress. Furthermore, the relatively low Mesor and Amplitude in heart rate, along with a stable circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.16), suggest a degree of physiological resilience. The correlation data does not strongly point to elevated stress; for example, the negative correlation between happiness and PSS (-0.19) aligns with lower stress. Despite some sedentary habits and late sleep patterns, the absence of significant psychological distress markers suggests the participant is not experiencing high levels of perceived stress.

95490,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This participant exhibits a profile that suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, as indicated by a confluence of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators. The participant's score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is approximately 21.61, placing them around the median of the study population. Self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated (Z-score of 0.56), classifying them as ""anxious."" Conversely, self-esteem is below average (Z-score of -0.59), and current happiness is also lower than the population mean (Z-score of -0.53). These findings suggest a tendency towards worry and lower self-regard, which are often associated with higher perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular social drinking (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), which is above average for the population. They also report exercising alone three times a week or more, a behavior that is more frequent than the average participant. However, engagement in organized sports is infrequent (1-2 times a month), and participation in more sedentary recreational activities like reading and video games is notably low (""Do not do""). Time spent socializing with friends is relatively high (2-3 hours), which might serve as a positive coping mechanism, but the overall pattern of activity suggests a mixed profile in terms of health-promoting behaviors.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by Fitbit data, displays some irregularities. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -1.48) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of -1.12) are significantly below population norms, suggesting a less regular daily pattern of activity and physiological function. This lack of regularity, particularly in the circadian rhythm, can be a marker for increased stress and poorer adaptation. The mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.43), and the resting heart rate is also slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.39), potentially reflecting a state of mild physiological arousal. Notably, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Z-score of -0.79), which may indicate reduced daily variability in physiological activity, potentially linked to a blunted stress response or a less robust recovery. The sleep duration is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.30), with a median sleep start time of approximately 1:11 AM, suggesting a potentially later sleep schedule than the average. The standard deviation in sleep start time is above average (Z-score of 0.40), indicating some variability in sleep onset.

The participant's perceived stress level, as indicated by their PSS score, is approximately 21.61. The population distribution for the PSS shows a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. This suggests that the participant's score falls around the middle of the distribution. Evidence supporting a lower or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes their moderate PSS score relative to the population median. Their lower self-reported happiness (Z-score of -0.53) and lower self-esteem (Z-score of -0.59) could contribute to a higher stress perception, but these are not extreme. Furthermore, their PSQI score of 6.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicates subjective sleep quality issues, which can be a correlate of stress.

Conversely, evidence for a higher PSS score (top 50th percentile) comes from the elevated STAI trait anxiety score (Z-score of 0.56), which is a significant indicator of a predisposition to experience stress. The less stable circadian rhythm metrics (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.48, Autocorrelation Z-score: -1.12) also suggest a potential vulnerability to stress and less effective daily functioning. While their PSS score is not exceptionally high, the combination of moderate anxiety, lower self-esteem and happiness, disturbed sleep, and physiological markers of circadian irregularity suggests a leaning towards the higher end of perceived stress within the study population.

Holistically, considering the elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, disturbed sleep, and the less regular circadian rhythm, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale score likely falls within the top 50th percentile of the study population. While their PSS score itself is close to the median, the constellation of other indicators points towards a greater susceptibility to stress and a higher overall stress burden compared to the average participant.

90079,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a multimodal profile suggesting a moderate to high perceived stress level. Self-report data indicate a CES-D score of 14.0, falling within the ""Not depressed"" classification and a Z-score of 0.07, suggesting typical levels of depressive symptoms within the study population. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 38.0 and a Z-score of -0.33 suggest that the participant is not chronically anxious. Self-esteem appears to be within the average range with a score of 34.0 and a Z-score of -0.59, indicating no significant elevation or deficit in self-worth. Notably, trust in others is relatively low, indicated by a score of 2.5 and a Z-score of -1.42, placing the participant in the lower quartile for this measure. Subjective happiness is also slightly below average, with a score of 3.0 and a Z-score of -0.53. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated at 7.0 with a Z-score of 0.13, indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" and falling just above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Physical health satisfaction is within the average range (Z-score of -0.2). Behavioral habits reveal a complete absence of alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drug usage. Exercise frequency is moderate, with exercising alone and with others occurring 1-2 times a week, while sports participation is infrequent. Daily recreational habits are characterized by limited engagement with sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and a preference for internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, each engaged in for 1-2 hours daily. Reading and other sedentary hobbies are minimally engaged with.

Wearable data provide further insights into physiological rhythms and activity patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm shows some signs of irregularity, with a notably low Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -1.65) and high Intradaily Variability (Z-score of 1.44), suggesting a less consistent daily routine and greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also low (Z-score of -1.54), further supporting a disrupted circadian rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.41), and the Amplitude (daily variation) is reduced (Z-score of -1.37), potentially indicating a less robust daily physiological cycle. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported as 4:54 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is relatively high compared to the population (Z-score of 0.89). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals elevated heart rates during the late morning and early afternoon hours (e.g., 6-7 AM, 8-9 AM, 12-1 PM), with notable positive deviations. Conversely, lower than average heart rates are observed during the early morning and late evening hours. This pattern, coupled with a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score of -1.59), which is significantly shorter than average, and a disturbed sleep quality indicated by the PSQI score, strongly suggests that insufficient and disrupted sleep may be contributing to elevated perceived stress. The standard deviations for sleep duration and start time are within average ranges, implying some consistency within the limited sleep obtained, but the overall duration remains a concern.

Considering the available data, the participant's profile suggests a higher level of perceived stress. While self-reported measures of depression and anxiety are not elevated, the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep, and the wearable data reveals significant disruptions in circadian rhythm regularity and reduced sleep duration. These physiological and behavioral indicators of poor sleep and irregular daily patterns are strongly associated with increased stress. The low trust score and average happiness further contribute to the overall picture of someone likely experiencing significant internal strain.

22842,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators that warrant detailed analysis in relation to perceived stress. Self-report measures reveal a moderate level of psychological distress. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 20.0 suggests a burden of depressive symptoms, while the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 46.0 indicates a proneness to anxiety. In contrast, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), is within the average range (Score: 36.0, Z-Score: -0.31), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Score: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53). Trust in others is also at an average level (Score: 3.33, Z-Score: 0.18). The participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0, which is notably above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and has a high positive Z-score (1.52). This subjective experience of poor sleep is supported by wearable data, which shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes, a relatively adequate duration with a positive Z-score (0.83), but a highly variable sleep start time, with a standard deviation of 164 minutes and a significant positive Z-score (1.79), indicating considerable irregularity.

Behavioral patterns also contribute to the understanding of this participant's profile. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows variability, with a strong performance in Spring 2016 (3.9) contrasting with a lower performance in Fall 2016 (2.37). Health satisfaction is moderately high (Score: 5.44, Z-score: 0.88). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, and recreational drugs, is infrequent, with Z-scores generally indicating below-average consumption. Exercise habits are mixed: the participant exercises alone frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score: 1.07), but engages in sports and exercises with others less frequently. Daily recreation shows a notable preference for video games, with a high Z-score of 1.71 for time spent, while reading is minimal (""Do not do,"" Z-score: -0.67). Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported at moderate levels.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveals distinct patterns in heart rate regulation and circadian rhythmicity. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Value: 54.2, Z-Score: -0.47). The mesor (average heart rate) is also below average (Value: 69.34, Z-Score: -0.63), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is similarly low (Value: 8.7, Z-Score: -0.67), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, representing the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the early evening (6:03 PM). Circadian rhythm regularity is indicated by a low interdaily stability (Value: 0.3, Z-Score: -0.9), suggesting inconsistent daily patterns in heart rate, and moderate intradaily variability (Value: 0.46, Z-Score: -0.6), indicating a moderate level of within-day heart rate fluctuations. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals an interesting pattern of deviations from the mesor. Notably, there are significant positive deviations (indicating higher than average heart rate for that hour) during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: 2.76, 2-3 AM: -4.7 but with a high Z-score of 1.11; 3-4 AM: -8.71 with a high Z-score of 1.21, 4-5 AM: -13.23 with a high Z-score of 0.81, 5-6 AM: -17.86 with a Z-score close to 0, 6-7 AM: -18.89 with a Z-score of -0.23), followed by more pronounced negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate) during these same early morning hours. This suggests a disruption in the typical diurnal pattern of heart rate, with some periods showing elevated heart rate and others showing significantly suppressed heart rate relative to the mesor. Notably, the period between 12 PM and 4 PM shows positive deviations from the mesor, with the largest deviation observed between 1-2 PM (11.37).

Considering the provided data, particularly the self-reported measures of anxiety and depression, coupled with the significantly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score and sleep start time variability), the participant's perceived stress is likely elevated. While their self-esteem and happiness are not extremely low, the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, along with poor sleep, are strong indicators of stress. The academic performance fluctuations and the high engagement in video games, while not directly indicative of stress, could be coping mechanisms or reflect periods of high engagement that might be stressful. The physiological data's disruption in circadian rhythm regularity and the unusual heart rate patterns during sleep and early morning hours further support a state of physiological dysregulation, often associated with elevated stress. Given the population's average PSS score is 21.61 and the 75th percentile is 24.0, and considering the confluence of factors pointing towards distress, it is reasonable to infer that this participant's PSS score would fall within the upper half of the distribution.

14279,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally healthy profile with some notable indicators. Self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms are within the non-clinical range, with STAI scores indicating low proneness to chronic anxiety and CES-D scores suggesting minimal recent depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is also within the upper range, as indicated by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score. However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, while not extremely high, falls above the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, suggesting subjective difficulties with sleep quality. This is supported by a relatively high median sleep duration, indicating participants are spending a substantial amount of time in bed, but the PSQI score suggests this time may not be restorative.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week) but reports no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. They exhibit a balanced approach to exercise, participating in both solitary and group activities 1-2 times a week, and engaging in sports with similar frequency. Daily recreational habits lean towards lower engagement with passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, and moderate engagement with the internet. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily, which is a positive indicator of social connection. Notably, the participant reports ""do not do"" for listening to music and reading, which are activities often associated with stress reduction and relaxation.

Physiologically, the Fitbit data reveals a robust circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a relatively high Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 0.58) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 0.81). This suggests a consistent daily pattern in heart rate. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.41) above the population mean, and the Amplitude is notably high (Z-score = 1.11), indicating a larger daily variation in heart rate. The Acrophase, the peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:05 PM), which is typical. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows periods of significant deviation from the Mesor, particularly during the late morning and early evening hours (11 AM - 1 PM and 6 PM - 7 PM, respectively), suggesting higher physiological arousal during these times. These periods of elevated heart rate might coincide with academic demands or other daily stressors. The participant's resting heart rate is within the average range (Z-score = 0.1). Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (Z-score = 1.24), but a standard deviation in sleep duration suggests some variability. The sleep start time is also fairly consistent.

Correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) suggest that lower self-reported happiness (correlation = -0.19) and less reading time (correlation = -0.21) are weakly associated with higher PSS scores. Conversely, higher Intradaily Variability in heart rate (correlation = 0.16) and a higher CES-D score (correlation = 0.28) also show weak positive associations with PSS. The positive correlation between CES-D and PSS, while moderate, aligns with the general understanding that depressive symptoms can co-occur with perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine whether the participant falls into the top or bottom half of the study population regarding their PSS score, we will holistically analyze the available evidence. The population PSS mean is 21.62, with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. This means that scoring above 22.0 places an individual in the top 50% of the population.

Evidence suggesting a potentially higher PSS score includes the PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep quality, despite a longer sleep duration. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the population mean, and this metric shows a weak positive correlation with PSS. Furthermore, the participant's self-reported happiness is below average, and lower happiness is weakly correlated with higher PSS. The absence of reading as a daily habit, which is often associated with stress reduction, might also contribute to a higher stress experience. The higher Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm suggests a greater physiological response to daily fluctuations, which can be indicative of stress.

Conversely, evidence suggesting a potentially lower PSS score is the participant's low scores on the CES-D and STAI scales, indicating minimal depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety. Their self-esteem is high, and trust is relatively low, but the correlation of these with PSS is weak or negligible. Behavioral patterns, such as regular exercise and moderate social interaction, are generally protective against high stress. The strong Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours in heart rate suggest a well-structured circadian rhythm, which is typically associated with lower stress.

Considering the data holistically, the elevated sleep disturbance as indicated by the PSQI, the increased physiological variability in heart rate (Amplitude and Intradaily Variability), and the self-reported lower happiness, when weighed against the positive indicators of low anxiety and depression, suggest a tendency towards the higher end of the perceived stress spectrum. While the participant does not present with extreme scores in any single area that would definitively place them in the top 10%, the combination of factors, particularly concerning sleep quality and physiological reactivity, indicates that their overall perceived stress level is likely to be at or above the median of the study population. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that their PSS score would likely fall within the top 50% of the distribution.

28327,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant presents with several self-reported psychological and behavioral markers that indicate elevated levels of distress. The CES-D score of 33.0, with a Z-score of 2.05, falls into the ""Depressed"" classification, signifying a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. This is further corroborated by a high STAI-Trait score of 58.0 (Z-score 1.65), classifying the participant as ""anxious"" and indicating proneness to chronic anxiety. While self-esteem is relatively high (Z-score -1.71), the participant reports low levels of happiness (Current score 2.0, Z-score -1.61). Sleep quality is also a concern, with a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" and a subjective experience of poorer sleep. Physical health satisfaction is also low (Score 1.78, Z-score -1.86).

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, reporting drinking beer and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores slightly above the population mean for both. Exercise habits are moderate, with the participant exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, and participating in sports with similar frequency. Daily recreational habits indicate a preference for listening to music for 2-3 hours and engaging in internet usage for 1-2 hours. Notably, the participant reports not engaging in watching TV/videos/movies or video games, and spending limited time reading (15 minutes or less). Socializing with friends is reported for approximately 31 minutes an hour.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly above the population mean (Z-score 0.38), with a resting heart rate of 60.2 (Z-score 0.24), which is within a healthy range. The Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Value 14.01, Z-score 1.04), suggesting a significant daily variation in heart rate. This variability is further reflected in the hourly deviation from the Mesor. Elevated heart rate deviations are observed during evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 6-7 PM (Z-score 1.81) and 7-8 PM (Z-score 2.24), and also between 8-9 PM (Z-score 1.55). Significant deviations are also noted in the early morning hours, between 3-4 AM and 7-8 AM. Interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (Value 0.49, Z-score 0.67), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Value 0.69, Z-score 1.02). Sleep duration is above average (Median Sleep Duration 7 hours 37 minutes, Z-score 0.54), but sleep start time is variable, with a median start time around 1 AM and a standard deviation of 68 minutes (Z-score -0.33). The number of daily naps is slightly elevated (Value 0.12, Z-score 0.61).

The participant's elevated scores on measures of depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI-Trait), coupled with low self-reported happiness and low health satisfaction, strongly suggest a higher perceived stress level. While some physiological metrics like resting heart rate and sleep duration are within a normal range, the high amplitude of the circadian rhythm and significant evening/nighttime heart rate deviations might indicate physiological responses to stress or disrupted sleep patterns that are not fully captured by subjective reports. The moderate substance usage and limited engagement in passive recreational activities also do not necessarily mitigate potential stressors. Considering the significant psychological distress indicators, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the top half of the study population distribution.

52302,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant’s self-reported psychological and behavioral data present a nuanced picture. A score of 43 on the STAI-Trait scale, placing the participant at the 0.17 z-score, indicates a tendency towards trait anxiety, which is a moderate elevation within the study population. This is accompanied by a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (39 out of 40, z-score 0.11), suggesting strong self-worth despite the proneness to anxiety. The participant reports relatively low levels of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 7 (z-score -0.66). Trust in others is moderately high (score 3.5, z-score 0.5), while self-reported happiness is also above average (current score 4.0, z-score 0.55).

Regarding lifestyle and habits, this participant reports no substance usage across the categories of beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, with z-scores indicating significantly lower usage than the population average. Physical activity is engaged in with moderate regularity: exercising alone and with others 1-2 times per week, and participating in sports 1-2 times per week. Notably, the participant engages in higher-than-average daily recreational activities, particularly watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, z-score 1.28), playing video games (31 minutes an hour, z-score 1.71), and socializing with friends (3-4 hours, z-score 1.74), with internet usage also elevated (2-3 hours, z-score 0.85). Conversely, reading is not a regular habit. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (score 6.0, z-score -0.33), suggesting a potential area of concern despite the higher-than-average median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes (z-score 1.14).

Analysis of the wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data reveals several patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate stability, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.37 (z-score -0.33) and Intradaily Variability of 0.41 (z-score -0.95), indicating a less regular daily pattern than average. The Mesor (average heart rate rhythm) is slightly below the population mean (71.88, z-score -0.28), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is elevated (12.34, z-score 0.5), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase occurs in the late afternoon at 5:17 PM. The resting heart rate is notably low (52.5 bpm, z-score -0.67). Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals heightened cardiovascular activity during the afternoon and early evening, specifically between 1 PM and 3 PM (z-scores 1.53 and 1.82 respectively), and again in the late evening between 9 PM and 11 PM (z-scores 1.04 and 0.85). Conversely, there are marked decreases in heart rate relative to the Mesor during the early morning hours, particularly between 4 AM and 7 AM (z-scores -0.51 to -0.61), aligning with typical sleep patterns. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration, but with considerable variability in both duration and sleep start times, contributing to the overall disturbed sleep score.

Considering the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. While the participant exhibits moderate trait anxiety (STAI-Trait score) and disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI), these factors are offset by several indicators of well-being. The participant reports high self-esteem and happiness, along with very low substance usage and engagement in social activities and recreational screen time. The physiological data, while showing some variability in circadian rhythm regularity and heightened heart rate during certain evening hours, also indicate a low resting heart rate. Crucially, several key self-report measures that are often correlated with higher stress, such as depressive symptoms (CES-D) and general health dissatisfaction, are within or below average ranges for this participant. The correlations provided, while not overriding the holistic analysis, do not strongly indicate a significant association between the observed metrics and higher perceived stress. For instance, the strongest negative correlations with PSS are observed for reading time and self-esteem, suggesting that higher engagement in these areas might be associated with lower stress, and the participant exhibits high self-esteem. Therefore, the overall profile suggests a relatively lower or average perceived stress level.

46418,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with several indicators that warrant attention in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported measures reveal a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 18.0, Z-score 0.49), which positively correlates with perceived stress (r=0.28). Conversely, the participant reports being ""not anxious"" (STAI score of 38.0, Z-score -0.33) with a slight negative correlation to perceived stress (r=0.31). Self-esteem is within the average range (Score 38.0, Z-Score -0.03), with a weak negative correlation to stress (r=-0.15). Sleep quality is a notable concern, with a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z-Score 1.98), indicating significantly disturbed sleep compared to the population. This disturbed sleep has a weak positive correlation with perceived stress (r=0.10, not explicitly provided but inferred from common understanding). Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Score 4.0, Z-Score 0.55), with a weak negative correlation to stress (r=-0.19). Health satisfaction is low (Score 2.67, Z-score -1.2), suggesting a potential impact on overall well-being, and it shows a weak negative correlation with stress (r=-0.08).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance use (Beer 1-2 times a week, Z=1.01; Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week, Z=0.94) with minimal correlation to stress. Notably, they exercise with others frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z=1.23) and participate in sports at a high frequency (""Three times a week or more,"" Z=1.58), both of which have weak negative correlations with perceived stress (r=-0.02 and r=-0.13 respectively). Daily recreational habits include a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28), with a weak positive correlation to stress (r=0.04), while other sedentary activities like reading and video games are at lower frequencies. Socializing with friends occurs for a moderate duration (""31 minutes an hour,"" Z=-0.62), with a weak positive correlation to stress (r=0.06).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates an elevated circadian rhythm amplitude (Amplitude: 15.07, Z-Score 1.39), suggesting greater daily swings in heart rate, which has a weak negative correlation with stress (r=-0.17). The resting heart rate is within the normal range (57.8 bpm, Z-Score -0.04) with a weak positive correlation to stress (r=0.14). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 5-6 PM: 26.09, Z=2.27; 6-7 PM: 22.76, Z=1.78). These elevated late-day heart rate deviations correlate weakly with perceived stress (r=-0.0 to -0.13 for these specific hours). Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 44 minutes (Z-Score 0.69), which is slightly longer than the population average, with a weak negative correlation to stress (r=-0.05). However, the sleep start time is late (median 01:49:45) and shows greater variability than average (SD 52 minutes, Z-Score -0.68), with a weak positive correlation to stress (r=0.17). The interdaily stability of heart rate (0.53, Z=1.0) is average, indicating some regularity in daily patterns, but intradaily variability (0.3, Z=-1.73) is notably low, suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which has a weak positive correlation with stress (r=0.16).

Holistic Analysis:
The participant presents a mixed profile. While they report average self-esteem and low trait anxiety, they exhibit significantly disturbed sleep, moderate depressive symptoms, and low health satisfaction, all of which are often associated with elevated stress. The high frequency of sports participation and exercise with others are positive behavioral indicators that may buffer stress. However, the significant elevations in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and evening, coupled with a late and variable sleep schedule, suggest physiological dysregulation. The high amplitude of their circadian rhythm and low intradaily variability in heart rate could indicate a more rigid or disrupted physiological pattern. Given the combination of disturbed sleep, moderate depressive symptoms, and pronounced late-day physiological arousal, alongside the population statistics for PSS (mean 21.61, 50th percentile 22.0), the participant's data leans towards a higher perceived stress level. The PSQI score of 11.0 is particularly concerning as it is almost double the threshold for disturbed sleep and is almost 2 standard deviations above the mean. While specific PSS score is not provided, the presence of multiple correlated indicators of stress, particularly sleep disturbance and elevated late-day physiological arousal, suggests they are likely in the higher half of the distribution.

93002,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate generally low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D z-score = 0.07) and average trait anxiety (STAI z-score = -0.13), suggesting a relatively stable emotional baseline. Self-esteem is notably high (SelfEsteem z-score = -0.87), which typically acts as a buffer against stress. Similarly, self-reported happiness is also on the lower side of average (Happy z-score = -0.53), potentially reflecting a disposition towards moderate rather than high levels of positive affect. Health satisfaction is also below average (Health Satisfaction z-score = -0.78), though this is a single data point that may not directly correlate with perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, with low engagement in physical activity such as exercising alone or participating in sports. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is below the study population average. Daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, which are engaged in for longer durations than listening to music or socializing with friends. Notably, reading and other sedentary hobbies are reported as ""Do not do."" The PSQI score of 9.0 indicates disturbed sleep, which is significantly above the population average (PSQI z-score = 1.05).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm, as suggested by a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.67) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.81). The mesor, or average heart rate, is lower than the population average (Mesor z-score = -1.24), and the resting heart rate is also notably low (Resting Heart Rate z-score = -1.18). This suggests an efficient cardiovascular system at rest. However, the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct patterns. There is a significant elevation in heart rate during the evening hours, peaking between 7-8 PM (Z-score = 2.16), which may indicate physiological responses to stress or activity during that time. Conversely, heart rate is notably depressed during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), likely reflecting sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a below-average median sleep duration (6 hours 28 minutes, z-score = -0.88) and a tendency towards later sleep start times (Median Sleep Start Time at 01:16:23), with significant variability in both duration and start time. The increased mean daily naps (z-score = 1.21) further suggest potential sleep disturbances or attempts to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

The correlation analyses provide additional context. A positive correlation between STAI (trait anxiety) and PSS score (0.31) suggests that higher trait anxiety is associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, higher self-esteem is weakly negatively correlated with PSS score (-0.15), and higher self-reported happiness is also weakly negatively correlated (-0.19). Poor sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS score (though not explicitly provided, the PSQI score itself is high). Notably, there is a moderate positive correlation between Intradaily Variability of heart rate and PSS score (0.16), suggesting that greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day are associated with higher perceived stress. The elevated evening heart rate deviations (e.g., 7-8 PM, z-score=2.16) could be a physiological manifestation of perceived stress during this period.

Based on the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to fall within the top 50% of the study population distribution, indicating a relatively elevated level of perceived stress. While the participant reports low depressive symptoms and average trait anxiety, and possesses high self-esteem, several factors point towards higher stress. The significantly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 9.0, z-score = 1.05) is a strong indicator of underlying stress. Furthermore, the observed pattern of elevated heart rate deviations during evening hours, coupled with reduced sleep duration and inconsistent sleep timing, suggests physiological strain that is often associated with heightened stress. The moderate positive correlation between anxiety and PSS, and the positive correlation between heart rate variability and PSS, further support this conclusion. While some indicators like self-esteem are protective, the combined evidence from sleep, physiological responses, and behavioral patterns leans towards a higher perceived stress level.

56543,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics, with several metrics suggesting potential associations with heightened stress. Self-report data indicates elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 18.0, Z-score 0.49) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score 0.86). While self-esteem is relatively average (SelfEsteem score of 33.0, Z-score -0.73), and trust in others is slightly below the population mean (Trust score of 3.17, Z-score -0.14), these findings, when considered with other indicators, may suggest a lower capacity for managing stressors. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Health Satisfaction score of 5.44, Z-score 0.88), which could reflect the impact of underlying psychological distress. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score of 9.0, Z-score 1.05), aligning with objective sleep duration metrics.

Behaviorally, this participant exhibits notable patterns that could contribute to stress. They report substantial internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.19), which is significantly higher than the population average and has a slightly positive correlation with perceived stress. Conversely, engagement in reading (2-3 hours, Z-score 4.24) is exceptionally high, presenting a potential coping mechanism or an indicator of time displacement from other activities. Exercise habits are mixed; while they exercise alone more than three times a week (Z-score 1.07), their engagement in sports and exercising with others is infrequent, suggesting a limited social component to their physical activity. Notably, the participant does not report any substance usage, which is a protective factor. Their sedentary hobbies are also above average in duration.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals a higher-than-average mesor (82.27, Z-score 1.14) and resting heart rate (68.0, Z-score 1.17), indicative of a generally elevated baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively stable intraday variability (0.59, Z-score 0.32), but a lower interdaily stability (0.49, Z-score 0.67), suggesting some irregularity in daily rhythmicity. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is reported at 6:44 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights significant deviations during the late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 9-10 PM (26.75, Z-score 3.28) and 10-11 PM (44.16, Z-score 5.94). These extreme positive deviations suggest periods of heightened cardiovascular activity during times typically associated with rest and recovery. This pattern is also observed to a lesser extent between 3-6 AM. The median sleep duration is below the population average (6 hours 26 minutes, Z-score -0.94), and the median sleep start time is very late (02:22:30), further supporting the notion of disrupted sleep patterns. These physiological and sleep metrics, particularly the late sleep onset and the pronounced late-night heart rate elevations, align with the self-reported sleep disturbances and could be indicative of stress impacting sleep architecture and physiological regulation.

Overall, the participant's data suggests a profile characterized by elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, a disturbed sleep pattern with late sleep onset, and significant physiological dysregulation, particularly evidenced by late-night heart rate elevations and a higher baseline heart rate. These factors collectively point towards a higher level of perceived stress.

Considering the participant's elevated scores in anxiety (STAI), depression (CES-D), and disturbed sleep (PSQI), alongside a lower-than-average sleep duration and a pronounced pattern of late-night physiological arousal, it is highly probable that their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score falls within the top 50th percentile of the study population. While some positive attributes like high engagement in reading and absence of substance use are present, they do not appear to fully mitigate the impact of the observed psychological distress and physiological dysregulation. The significant deviations in heart rate during late evening and nighttime, coupled with a late sleep start time, are strong indicators of stress interfering with normal bodily functions and recovery.

89142,0.0,0.0051813471502590676,"This participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological patterns, which are analyzed in conjunction with their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. Self-reported data indicate moderate anxiety proneness, as evidenced by a STAI-Trait score of 48.0, which falls within the top 34% of the study population (Z-score = 0.66). While the CES-D score of 12.0 suggests no significant depressive symptoms, and self-esteem is near the population average (Z-score = -0.87), the reported low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -2.45) and a relatively lower GPA in Fall 2016 (3.33) may reflect underlying stressors. Behavioral habits are notable for a lack of engagement in most physical activities, including exercising alone, with others, and sports, all with significantly low Z-scores, suggesting a sedentary lifestyle. Conversely, the participant reports substantial engagement in reading (Z-score = 2.28) and video games (Z-score = 1.71), indicating a preference for solitary, less physically demanding activities. Substance usage is reported as minimal across all categories.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal a circadian rhythm with a lower-than-average Mesor (heart rate average, Value = 60.11, Z-score = -1.89), potentially indicating a lower basal metabolic rate or a blunted physiological response. The hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor demonstrate a distinct pattern: pronounced decreases during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.11 to -1.30) followed by a significant increase during typical waking hours, particularly between 7 AM and 10 AM (with Z-scores up to 1.81 and 1.69, respectively). This pattern suggests a delayed activation or a more pronounced difference between rest and activity phases. The acrophase, or peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late in the afternoon at 3:57 PM. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 50 minutes, which is notably short relative to the population (Z-score = -1.68). The standard deviation for sleep duration is high (Value = 123 minutes, Z-score = 0.51), suggesting inconsistency in sleep duration, further corroborated by a moderately variable sleep start time (Standard Deviation = 60 minutes, Z-score = -0.49). The PSQI score of 4.0 suggests good subjective sleep quality, which contrasts with the objectively measured short duration and variability. Overall, the participant exhibits a profile characterized by moderate anxiety, low physical health satisfaction, a sedentary lifestyle with specific recreational preferences, and suboptimal sleep patterns coupled with a distinct circadian rhythm profile.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is evaluated in the context of the study population's distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.67, with a standard deviation of 3.51. The 50th percentile (median) is 22.0, and the 75th percentile is 24.0. Without the participant's specific PSS score, a direct comparison is challenging. However, the available data provide indirect indicators. The participant exhibits moderate trait anxiety (STAI score = 48.0, Z-score = 0.66), which is positively correlated with PSS. Low physical health satisfaction (Z-score = -2.45) also correlates with PSS, and while this participant reports low satisfaction, the correlation is negative, suggesting that poor health satisfaction might be associated with lower stress, or other factors are at play. The shorter-than-average sleep duration (Z-score = -1.68) and variability in sleep patterns are generally associated with higher stress levels, and the correlation for median sleep duration is negative. The sedentary lifestyle, while not strongly correlated, could contribute to stress management challenges. Reading for extended periods and playing video games could be coping mechanisms, but their correlation with PSS is negative.

Considering the ensemble of indicators, the moderate trait anxiety is a significant factor potentially contributing to a higher PSS score. While other factors like sleep duration have negative correlations with PSS, the presence of anxiety is a more direct and commonly established correlate of perceived stress. The participant's self-reported moderate anxiety proneness, coupled with a lower-than-average GPA in a recent semester and low health satisfaction, collectively suggest a potential for elevated stress levels. Without the precise PSS score, definitive placement is difficult, but the constellation of traits leans towards the higher end of perceived stress rather than the lower. Therefore, it is plausible that this participant falls within the top 50th percentile for perceived stress.

24898,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics to interpret perceived stress levels in a university student population.

The participant reports a CES-D score of 14.0, falling within the ""Not depressed"" classification and exhibiting a negligible Z-score of 0.07, indicating a symptom burden comparable to the study population. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 45.0 places the participant in the ""anxious"" classification with a mild positive Z-score of 0.37, suggesting a slightly elevated proneness to chronic anxiety relative to peers. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is reported at 31.0, corresponding to a Z-score of -1.01, indicating a lower than average self-worth. Trust in others is also relatively low, with a score of 2.67 and a Z-score of -1.1. Happiness is reported at a moderate level, with a Z-score of 0.55. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, is rated at 6.0, falling into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification and exhibiting a Z-score of -0.33, suggesting slightly better than average subjective sleep quality despite the classification. Health satisfaction is reported as 5.44 on a 7-point scale, with a Z-score of 0.88, indicating a high level of satisfaction with their physical health.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports infrequent substance usage across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with Z-scores indicating usage less than or similar to the average. Notably, the participant engages in regular physical activity, exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports at a frequency of ""Three times a week or more,"" reflected in high positive Z-scores for these activities (1.07, 1.23, and 1.58, respectively). This high engagement in exercise, particularly sports, is weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress. Sedentary leisure activities include moderate engagement in video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.96) and relatively low internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.16). However, there is a significant dedication to listening to music for over 4 hours daily (Z-score 2.06) and reading for 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score 2.28). These higher engagement levels in activities like listening to music and reading show weak negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting a potential buffering effect. Conversely, daily television/video/movie watching is reported as ""Do not do,"" with a substantial negative Z-score (-1.25). Socializing with friends is reported for 2-3 hours daily, with a Z-score of 0.95.

Physiological data from the wearable reveals a number of patterns. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.99), suggesting a structured and regular daily routine, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, intradaily variability is low (Z-score -1.45), indicating less fluctuation in activity throughout the day. The mesor of heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.33), and amplitude is notably high (Z-score 1.64), suggesting a larger range of heart rate variation within a day. The resting heart rate is lower than average at 49.4 (Z-score -1.04). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late night and early morning hours. Heart rate is notably lower than the mesor between 1 am and 6 am, with the most pronounced negative deviations occurring between 2 am and 5 am (Z-scores ranging from -2.31 to -2.22). This aligns with periods of lower activity and likely sleep. Conversely, there are significant positive deviations during the late morning and afternoon, peaking between 2 pm and 3 pm (Z-score 2.62) and again in the early evening between 6 pm and 7 pm (Z-score 2.15). These periods of elevated heart rate deviation suggest times of heightened physiological arousal, potentially related to academic demands, social interactions, or other daily stressors. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, which is below average (Z-score -1.18). The median sleep start time is around 00:54, with a standard deviation suggesting some variability in sleep onset.

Overall, this participant demonstrates a relatively structured lifestyle with high engagement in physical activity and certain leisure pursuits like reading and listening to music, which are associated with lower stress. However, they also exhibit elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem and trust, and disturbed sleep patterns. The significant positive deviations in heart rate during the afternoon and early evening, coupled with below-average sleep duration, are noteworthy physiological indicators that may be associated with perceived stress. The strong negative correlations of interdaily stability and positive correlations of intradaily variability with perceived stress, combined with the high amplitude of heart rate variation, suggest that disruptions in daily routine or heightened physiological responses to stimuli could contribute to higher stress.

The participant's PSS score would likely fall into the **top 50%** of the study population. While the participant exhibits some positive coping mechanisms such as regular exercise and dedicated leisure time (reading, music), and has high interdaily stability suggesting routine, there are several indicators pointing towards elevated stress. The reported anxiety levels (STAI-Trait), lower self-esteem, and disturbed sleep quality are all consistent with higher perceived stress. Physiologically, the pronounced positive deviations in heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening, potentially reflecting responses to academic or social pressures, combined with below-average sleep duration, suggest a system under strain. The high amplitude of heart rate variability, while indicating potential for high activity, can also be interpreted as a system more reactive to stressors. Although interdaily stability is high, the negative correlation with PSS suggests that while their routine is structured, the demands within that structure may be leading to stress. The moderate GPA scores and the timing of the survey submission (November 3rd, likely mid-semester) further suggest that academic pressures may be contributing to their perceived stress. Considering these factors collectively, the constellation of psychological and physiological indicators points towards a PSS score that is likely higher than the median.

74413,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits several behavioral and physiological patterns that warrant careful consideration in relation to perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a generally low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02), suggesting a relatively stable psychological baseline. Self-esteem is reported as higher than the average participant (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.1), and happiness levels are slightly below average (Happy Z-score: -0.53). Health satisfaction is notably low (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -1.2), which may reflect subjective experiences not fully captured by other metrics.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, this participant abstains from substance use (Beer, Wine/Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all have Z-scores below -1.0). They engage in exercise alone with a frequency greater than the average participant (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07), but less frequently with others. Sports engagement is also slightly above average. Daily recreation habits reveal a preference for reading (Reading Z-score: 1.3) and socializing with friends (Socializing with Friends Z-score: 0.16), while actively avoiding watching TV/videos/movies and video games. Internet usage is exceptionally low (Internet Usage Z-score: -2.5), which is a notable deviation from typical student behaviors. Sleep quality, as measured by PSQI, is classified as disturbed (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), though the score itself is not exceptionally high.

Wearable data provides insights into the participant's physiological regulation and daily rhythms. The circadian rhythm metrics suggest a less regular daily structure, indicated by lower interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.41) and higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 1.51). The MESOR and amplitude of heart rate are close to population averages. The acrophase (peak heart rate) occurs in the early evening, around 6:27 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly lower than average (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -0.33). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveals significant elevations during late evening hours, particularly between 10 PM and 11 PM (10-11pm Z-score: 2.46), and also during mid-afternoon (3-4pm Z-score: 1.38). Conversely, heart rate deviates negatively from the MESOR during early morning hours, suggesting periods of lower physiological arousal. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration slightly longer than average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.47) but with considerable variability (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -1.34), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is just after midnight, with moderate variability.

Considering the interplay of these factors, the elevated heart rate during late evening hours, coupled with higher intradaily variability and a disturbed sleep quality classification, suggests a potential physiological strain. While self-reported anxiety and depression are low, the observed physiological patterns, particularly the late-night heart rate elevations and sleep inconsistency, might be indicative of underlying stress responses that are not fully captured by self-report measures alone. The low health satisfaction also aligns with a potential for increased stress. The participant's PSS score is likely to be within the top half of the study population distribution.

77789,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators. Self-reported data reveal a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score 0.7) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score 0.17). Conversely, self-esteem appears to be within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 36.0, Z-Score -0.31), and reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy Z-Score 0.55). Sleep quality is subjectively assessed as disturbed (PSQI score of 6.0, Z-Score -0.33), aligning with a relatively short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-Score -0.8), which is lower than the population mean. However, the variability in sleep duration is notably high (Z-Score 1.49), suggesting inconsistency in nightly sleep. The participant's sleep start time also exhibits considerable variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score -0.45). Behavioral data indicate a low engagement in physical activity, with infrequent exercise alone (Frequency '1-2 times a month', Z-Score -0.43) and no reported exercise with others or participation in sports (Z-Scores -1.58 and -1.09 respectively). Substance usage, including beer and wine/liquor, falls within or below the average range for the population. Daily recreational habits show minimal engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV, video games, and internet usage, but moderate reading time (16-30 minutes, Z-Score 1.3) and a somewhat limited duration of socializing with friends (31 minutes to an hour, Z-Score -0.62).

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics offer further insights into the participant's daily functioning. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is elevated (Mesor Z-Score 1.26), suggesting a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activity. This is further supported by a higher resting heart rate (Resting Heart Rate Z-Score 1.25). The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a relatively stable pattern, as suggested by moderate interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z-Score 0.67), but with a more variable intradaily pattern (Intradaily Variability Z-Score -0.39). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average (Amplitude Z-Score -0.99), implying a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Examining the hourly deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of increased heart rate during the morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-Score 1.71) and a generally elevated state throughout the day, with a notable decrease during the late night and early morning hours, consistent with a sleep period. The acrophase, or peak time of heart rate, is reported at 4:00 PM.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is not directly provided, but can be inferred from the other data. The population mean PSS is 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68, placing the median at 22.0. This participant exhibits several indicators that could be associated with elevated perceived stress. The elevated CES-D and STAI scores, indicating depressive symptoms and trait anxiety respectively, are positively correlated with PSS (0.28 and 0.31). While self-esteem and happiness are within average or slightly positive ranges, their correlations with PSS are negative (-0.15 and -0.19), suggesting that lower levels in these domains might be associated with higher stress. Subjectively reported poor sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.33) and objectively shorter sleep duration (Z-score -0.8) are also generally linked to increased stress. Furthermore, the elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z-scores 1.26 and 1.25) and the pattern of higher heart rate during waking hours suggest a potentially heightened physiological arousal state that could contribute to perceived stress. The limited engagement in exercise and social activities, which are typically stress-buffering behaviors, may further exacerbate stress levels. While the data do not provide a direct PSS score, the convergence of elevated anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep, and physiological markers of arousal, coupled with low engagement in stress-reducing behaviors, suggests that this participant is likely experiencing a perceived stress level that would place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

Health satisfaction is marginally above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.55). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is exceptionally high across multiple semesters, with the most recent recorded GPA at a perfect 4.0. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), though this score is not significantly elevated compared to the population mean, suggesting that while perceived sleep quality is not optimal, it does not represent an extreme deviation.

Behavioral habits reveal a tendency towards moderate substance use, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (Beer Z-score: 1.01), placing this behavior in the upper portion of the study population. Other substance use, including wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, falls within or below population norms. Physical activity is consistent, with exercise alone occurring three times a week or more (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07), and exercise with others 1-2 times a week. Sports participation is less frequent, occurring 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational habits indicate a relatively low engagement with passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and sedentary hobbies, with reported times at or below population medians. Internet usage is also at a moderate level, and time spent listening to music is above average. Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes an hour, which is not a high engagement. Notably, reading is not a reported daily habit.

Wearable data present a more nuanced picture of physiological and circadian rhythm regularity. Interdaily stability of heart rate is lower than average (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -0.57), suggesting less consistency in daily routines or physiological patterns. This is further supported by a slightly higher than average intraday variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: 0.6), indicating more fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also lower than average (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: -0.78), reinforcing the impression of less predictable daily rhythms. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is lower than the population mean (Mesor Z-score: -1.22), and the resting heart rate is also notably low (Resting Heart Rate Z-score: -1.28), which could indicate good cardiovascular fitness. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is very close to the population average (Amplitude Z-score: -0.03). The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is reported at 6:01 PM, which falls within typical diurnal patterns.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern. During late night and early morning hours (1:00 AM - 6:00 AM), heart rate deviations are significantly lower than the mesor, with particularly pronounced negative deviations between 3:00 AM and 6:00 AM (e.g., 4-5 AM: -20.86, 5-6 AM: -24.59). This suggests a period of physiological rest and reduced arousal during these hours. Conversely, during the evening and night (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM), heart rate deviations are notably higher than the mesor, peaking between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM (8-9 PM: 17.22). This might reflect increased physiological activity or stress responses during these times. Other periods of the day show smaller deviations, generally fluctuating around the mesor, with some moderate positive deviations in the early morning and late afternoon/early evening.

Sleep statistics indicate a significantly shorter median sleep duration than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: -1.53), averaging under 6 hours. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also lower than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.76), suggesting relatively consistent, albeit short, sleep. The median sleep start time is quite late, at 02:34 AM, with a standard deviation of 40 minutes, indicating consistency in this late sleep onset. The presence of occasional naps is minimal (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: 0.04).

In summary, this participant presents with high academic achievement and positive self-reported psychological traits (low depression, low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness). However, they exhibit a pattern of disturbed subjective sleep quality and significantly shorter sleep duration. Their physiological data suggest a less regular daily rhythm with more variability in heart rate throughout the day, alongside a late sleep start time. Moderate beer consumption and higher engagement in listening to music are also noted behavioral patterns.

Based on the available data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score would likely fall in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population, representing relatively low or average perceived stress. While the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI and exhibits significantly shorter sleep duration and a late sleep onset from wearable data, these factors do not appear to translate into elevated levels of self-reported anxiety or depression. The high academic achievement, high self-esteem, and high happiness scores are strong indicators of resilience and effective stress management. The negative correlations observed between PSS and several psychological well-being indicators (e.g., lower happiness, lower trust, lower self-esteem) further support the notion that a higher PSS score would be associated with worse scores on these measures, which this participant does not exhibit. While physiological metrics like lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability of heart rate might suggest some dysregulation, the exceptionally low resting heart rate and mesor could indicate good cardiovascular health, which is often associated with lower stress. The observed late-night physiological arousal (higher heart rate deviations) might be a consequence of late sleep onset rather than a primary indicator of high stress.

19245,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits several self-reported characteristics suggestive of elevated psychological distress. The scores on the CES-D (26.0) and STAI (55.0) fall into the ""Depressed"" and ""anxious"" classifications, respectively, with Z-scores of 1.32 and 1.35, indicating they are above the mean of the study population for these measures. This aligns with a lower self-esteem score (-0.45 Z-score) and a reduced sense of happiness (-1.61 Z-score), which are weakly to moderately negatively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0, which is slightly above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, and a Z-score of 0.13 suggesting a slightly poorer sleep quality compared to the population.

Behaviorally, this participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 1.01), which is above the population average. However, other substance use is at or below population averages. Exercise habits are mixed, with more frequent solo exercise (""Three times a week or more"", Z-score 1.07) compared to exercising with others or participating in sports. Daily recreational habits are characterized by significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95), both above the population means. There is also a notable amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41), while internet usage and reading are closer to the population average or below.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a lower than average resting heart rate (49.6, Z-score -1.02) and a lower Mesor (66.42, Z-score -1.03), suggesting a potentially lower baseline cardiovascular activity. The circadian rhythm metrics, specifically Interdaily Stability (0.31, Z-score -0.82), are indicative of reduced regularity in daily activity patterns. Sleep statistics show a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 6 minutes, Z-score 1.14) and a higher standard deviation for sleep duration (155 minutes, Z-score 1.23), as well as a more variable sleep start time (125 minutes standard deviation, Z-score 0.92). This, coupled with a high mean daily nap frequency (0.27, Z-score 2.27), suggests irregular sleep patterns, potentially contributing to the reported subjective sleep quality issues. The hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the Mesor during certain periods, particularly elevated during late night/early morning hours (12-1am, 1-2am, 10-11pm, 11-12am) and a notable dip during the late morning (8-9am, Z-score -1.73). These elevated deviations during sleep/early waking hours could reflect physiological responses to stress or disrupted sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's self-reported data strongly suggests a higher than average level of perceived stress. The elevated scores on the CES-D (indicating depressive symptoms) and STAI (indicating chronic anxiety) are key indicators of psychological distress, and both are moderately positively correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Furthermore, the participant reports lower than average self-esteem and happiness, which are generally associated with higher perceived stress. The classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" from the PSQI, despite a longer average sleep duration, suggests that the quality of sleep is compromised, a common consequence and contributor to heightened stress.

Behaviorally, while there is engagement in social activities and exercise, the overall pattern, including substance use, time spent on passive entertainment, and sedentary hobbies, does not strongly counteract the psychological distress indicated by the survey data. The physiological data from the wearable devices reveals an irregular daily structure, as indicated by low Interdaily Stability, and variable sleep patterns. The significant deviations in hourly heart rate, particularly during the night and early morning, may reflect an agitated state or a response to ongoing stressors impacting physiological regulation.

Considering the convergence of evidence from multiple domains – significant elevations in anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and happiness, disturbed sleep quality, and physiological indicators of irregular daily functioning – it is highly probable that this participant's Perceived Stress Scale score falls within the top 50% of the study population, indicating relatively elevated perceived stress.

83748,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"The participant exhibits several characteristics that could influence their perceived stress levels. Self-report data indicates a low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.71, ""not anxious""), which is a protective factor against high stress. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score: 1.64), suggesting a generally positive affective state. Self-esteem is also elevated (Z-score: 1.52), which can contribute to better coping mechanisms and resilience. Subjective health satisfaction is moderately above average (Z-score: 0.72). Conversely, the participant reports a CES-D score that falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification (Z-score: -0.45), indicating a low burden of depressive symptoms. Their Body Mass Index (17.74) is on the lower side, potentially indicating a lean physique.

In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant engages in regular exercise, both alone and with others, and participates in sports at a frequency of ""Three times a week or more,"" with Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively. This high level of physical activity is generally associated with stress reduction. Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" or ""Not at all,"" with Z-scores indicating usage below the population average, suggesting healthy choices in this domain. Daily recreation habits are generally brief, with ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies,"" ""Video Games,"" ""Listening to Music,"" and ""Socializing with Friends"" all reported as ""15 minutes or less"" or ""Do not do,"" and some of these activities have notably low Z-scores (e.g., Socializing with Friends Z-score: -2.2). Internet usage and reading are within moderate ranges.

Wearable data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.33, which is only slightly below average, and an Intradaily Variability Z-score of 0.1, suggesting moderate regularity in daily activity patterns. The Mesor (average heart rate) is below the population average (Z-score: -0.62), and the participant has a lower than average resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.34). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is close to average (Z-score: -0.17). However, the participant's sleep duration is slightly shorter than the population median (6 hours 54 minutes, Z-score: -0.35), and their sleep start time is quite late, with a median start time of 00:19:45 and a sleep start time standard deviation below average (Z-score: -0.93), suggesting a tendency towards later bedtimes, but with relative consistency. There are no reported daily naps.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns. During the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM), the participant exhibits significant negative deviations from their mesor (e.g., 5-6 AM Z-score: -0.65), indicating periods of lower cardiovascular activity during typical sleep hours. As the morning progresses, heart rate deviations become positive, with notable peaks in the late afternoon and evening. Specifically, the 5-6 PM (Z-score: 1.69), 6-7 PM (Z-score: 2.67), and 10-11 PM (Z-score: 1.68) hours show the most substantial positive deviations, suggesting increased physiological arousal during these periods. This pattern, coupled with a median sleep start time after midnight, may indicate a delayed circadian phase or a tendency for increased activity or stress during later hours of the day. The relatively low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -0.87) suggests that daily heart rate patterns are not strongly predictive of the next day's patterns.

Considering the overall data, the participant presents with low levels of trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, and high self-esteem and happiness. Their lifestyle is characterized by consistent and frequent physical activity and low substance use. However, their sleep start time is late, and their sleep duration is slightly below average. The pronounced peaks in heart rate deviation during the evening hours (5-11 PM) are noteworthy and may represent periods of increased physiological arousal that could be linked to perceived stress, particularly if these coincide with demanding academic or social activities. While many indicators point towards a low-stress profile, the elevated heart rate activity in the evening warrants attention. The correlation between evening heart rate deviations and PSS scores should be considered. For example, the 6-7 PM deviation has a strong positive correlation with PSS (2.67 Z-score, -0.12 correlation), as does 10-11 PM (1.68 Z-score, -0.15 correlation), and 5-6 AM (22.09 Z-score, 0.00 correlation). This suggests that higher physiological arousal during these times is associated with lower perceived stress, which is counterintuitive and may require further investigation or indicate that these periods of high arousal are not perceived as stressful. However, the strong positive correlations suggest that periods of high arousal during the day are not contributing to higher PSS.

Given the conflicting signals, particularly the low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness scores, balanced against some potential indicators of disrupted sleep and late-night physiological arousal, a definitive placement requires careful consideration of the PSS population distribution. The population mean PSS is 21.62, with a median of 22.0. The participant's STAI score (24) is significantly below the STAI range that would typically be associated with high anxiety, and their CESD score (9) is well below a threshold for depression. The positive correlations between evening heart rate deviations and PSS are confusing; however, the absence of high anxiety and depression symptoms, combined with high happiness and self-esteem, suggests a general resilience. Without the participant's actual PSS score, we must infer based on the provided correlations and self-report data. The strong protective factors (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness) suggest a predisposition towards lower perceived stress. The positive correlations of evening heart rate deviations with PSS might imply that these periods of physiological arousal are not perceived as stressful by this individual, or that the arousal is associated with activities that are not stress-inducing. Therefore, it is more likely that the participant falls into the bottom half of the PSS distribution.

63347,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant exhibits several psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant examination in relation to perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate level of anxiety, as suggested by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 45, which classifies them as anxious and has a positive correlation with perceived stress. While their depression symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are not indicative of clinical depression, the score shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. Notably, their self-esteem is at the maximum score of 40, suggesting a protective factor, although this measure shows a negative correlation with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is relatively low (Z-score of -0.78), with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress. Substance usage, including beer, wine, and liquor, is reported as less than 1-2 times a month, and recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all. These low-usage patterns are generally associated with neutral or weakly negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting that substance use is not a significant stress coping mechanism or exacerbating factor in this case.

Behavioral habits reveal a generally sedentary lifestyle. Exercise frequency across all categories (alone, with others, sports) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with significantly low Z-scores for exercising alone (-1.93) and with others (-1.58), indicating a substantial deviation from the population norm for physical activity. Daily recreational habits also lean towards passive engagement. While video game usage and internet usage are at or above the population average for the time spent, other activities like watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading are at the lower end of reported durations (15 minutes or less, or 16-30 minutes). Reading, in particular, is notably absent (""Do not do""), which is associated with a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress. This pattern suggests a limited engagement in activities that may buffer or alleviate stress.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveals a relatively regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by a moderate interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.58) and low intradaily variability (Z-score of -1.38), suggesting a structured daily physiological pattern. The mesor (average heart rate around the daily rhythm) is elevated compared to the population average (Z-score of 1.13), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also significantly high (Z-score of 1.69), indicating a greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs in the late afternoon (5:43 PM). The participant’s resting heart rate is within the population norm (Z-score of -0.15). Analysis of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor for hourly heart rates highlights elevated physiological arousal during the evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7-8 PM and 9-11 PM, with the most pronounced deviation occurring between 7-8 PM (Z-score of 2.29). Conversely, heart rate deviations are lowest during the early morning hours, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern, albeit with pronounced evening activity. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 49 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.46) and shows considerable nightly variation (Z-score of 1.14). The median sleep start time is late (01:28:09 AM), with moderate variability.

Considering the available data holistically, the participant's psychological profile suggests a tendency towards anxiety and a lack of active stress-coping mechanisms, such as regular exercise. The sedentary lifestyle and limited engagement in restorative activities like reading are noteworthy. While self-esteem is high, which might offer some resilience, the elevated anxiety levels and disturbed sleep patterns (indicated by PSQI score of 7 and lower than average sleep duration with high variability) are significant indicators of potential stress. The physiological data reveals a pattern of increased cardiovascular arousal during evening and night, which could be indicative of a dysregulated stress response or a consequence of heightened psychological arousal. The elevated mesor and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm, coupled with high variability in sleep duration, suggest a physiological system that may be under strain. The strong positive correlations of anxiety (STAI) and the negative correlation of reading with perceived stress, alongside the objectively lower sleep duration and higher variability, all point towards factors contributing to elevated stress levels.

Therefore, considering the combined evidence of increased anxiety, low engagement in physical activity and restorative behaviors, and evidence of physiological dysregulation (elevated heart rate during evening/night, variable sleep duration), it is plausible that this participant experiences a PSS score within the top 50% of the study population.
