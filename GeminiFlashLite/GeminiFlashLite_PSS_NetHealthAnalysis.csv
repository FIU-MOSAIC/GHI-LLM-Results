44869,"The participant's overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, is **above the population mean**. This conclusion is supported by a combination of self-reported survey data and wearable-derived physiological metrics. Notably, the participant reports a relatively high score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with a Z-score of 1.52, indicating a significant disturbance in sleep quality. This aligns with a higher PSS score, as poorer sleep quality is often associated with increased stress. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a substantially elevated Mesor (average heart rate level) at 88.34 bpm (Z-score of 1.97), which is considerably higher than the population average. This elevated resting heart rate, coupled with a high Resting Heart Rate value (Z-score of 2.41), suggests a state of heightened physiological arousal that can be indicative of increased stress. The participant also exhibits greater than average variability in their sleep start times (Z-score of 1.63) and a higher standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of 2.09), pointing to sleep schedule irregularity which is frequently linked to elevated stress levels.

Several other factors contribute to the assessment of higher perceived stress. The participant's CES-D score of 22.0 falls within the ""Depressed"" classification range, and while its correlation with PSS is moderate (0.28), it suggests an underlying psychological burden that can exacerbate perceived stress. While the STAI score does not indicate general anxiety proneness, and self-esteem is within the average range, the combination of disturbed sleep and elevated physiological arousal strongly suggests a higher stress experience. Furthermore, the participant's daily recreational habits include significantly high durations of watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 1.91) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score of 3.19), which may represent coping mechanisms or a lack of engagement in more stress-reducing activities.

In contrast, certain metrics do not strongly indicate higher perceived stress. The participant reports no substance usage across all categories. Their exercise habits, while limited to ""1-2 times a month"" for exercising alone and ""Not at all"" for exercising with others or participating in sports, do not show extreme deviations that would directly correlate with elevated stress in this dataset. Similarly, trust in others and self-reported happiness are within the lower end of the average range, not suggesting significant distress in these specific areas. While the Intradaily Variability of heart rate is elevated (Z-score of 1.16), suggesting more fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, this can also be indicative of activity or engagement rather than solely stress. The acrophase occurring at 5:09 PM suggests a typical rhythm for peak heart rate during the day.

In summary, the participant's overall perceived stress level is assessed as **above the population mean**. This is primarily driven by robust indicators of disturbed sleep quality and quantity, significantly elevated average and resting heart rates, and a pattern of sedentary leisure activities. While some psychological and behavioral measures do not strongly point towards high stress, the confluence of physiological arousal and sleep disturbances provides a compelling case for a higher perceived stress experience relative to the study population."
92552,"This analysis integrates self-report survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to evaluate perceived stress levels as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant's overall PSS score is inferred to be **above the population mean**, aligning with a higher perceived stress experience.

Several indicators suggest a relatively high perceived stress level for this participant. The participant reports a moderate level of trait anxiety (STAI Score: 45.0, Z-score: 0.37), which correlates positively with PSS. Furthermore, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-Score: 0.59) indicates disturbed sleep, a common correlate of elevated stress. Subjectively, the participant reports a lower level of happiness (Current Happiness Score: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55), which also shows a negative correlation with PSS. Behaviorally, there is a high frequency of beer and wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week), with higher Z-scores for these habits, and a notable absence of recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Regarding daily recreation, internet usage is reported for 1-2 hours, while reading is not engaged in at all (Z-Score: -0.67), and video game usage is also absent (Z-Score: -0.56). From wearable data, a higher than average sleep duration standard deviation (Z-Score: 1.66) and a high mean number of daily naps (Z-Score: 1.75) indicate a less consistent sleep pattern. The intradaily variability of heart rate is also elevated (Value: 0.59, Z-Score: 0.32), suggesting greater fluctuations in physiological arousal throughout the day.

Conversely, some data points suggest factors that might be associated with lower perceived stress. The participant's CES-D score is within the non-depressed range (Score: 15.0, Z-score: 0.18), and there is a weak positive correlation with PSS, indicating that depressive symptoms are not a primary driver of their perceived stress. Self-esteem appears to be within a typical range (SelfEsteem Score: 44.0, Z-Score: 0.82), with a slight negative correlation to PSS, suggesting that higher self-esteem is not strongly associated with lower stress in this case. Health satisfaction is reported as somewhat low (Score: 3.22, Z-score: -0.78), which has a minimal negative correlation with PSS. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours (Z-Score: 0.16), which might offer a buffer against stress, although the correlation with PSS is negligible. The mesor of the heart rate is significantly lower than the population mean (Value: 63.0, Z-Score: -1.49), indicating a generally lower baseline heart rate. The resting heart rate also falls below the population mean (Value: 48.8, Z-Score: -1.11), suggesting a good level of cardiovascular fitness. The sleep start time has a standard deviation of 94 minutes (Z-Score: 0.25), which, while indicative of some variability, is not as pronounced as the variability in sleep duration.

In conclusion, the combination of elevated trait anxiety, disturbed sleep quality, lower self-reported happiness, and less regular sleep patterns, alongside specific wearable-derived physiological patterns such as high intradaily heart rate variability, strongly suggests a higher overall perceived stress level for this participant. These factors outweigh the mitigating influences of a lower baseline heart rate and a non-depressed mood state. The participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from these data, appears to be **above the population mean** for the study sample."
73158,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with some indicators suggesting higher perceived stress, counterbalanced by several factors that point towards lower perceived stress. A key indicator of potentially elevated stress is the moderate engagement in exercising with others (Z-score of 1.23), which, while positive for physical and social well-being, can also represent a time commitment that may contribute to perceived demands. Furthermore, the participant reports spending 1 to 2 hours daily watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 1.28), a behavior often associated with lower levels of physical activity and potentially less proactive stress management. The sleep duration, with a median of 6 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score of -1.25), falls below typical recommendations and is a significant predictor of increased stress and reduced well-being. Coupled with a higher-than-average self-reported happiness score (Z-score of 1.64), and a relatively high self-esteem score (Z-score of 1.66), these psychological self-reports appear incongruent with the objective sleep data, potentially suggesting a disconnect between subjective feelings and underlying physiological states.

Conversely, several elements in the dataset strongly indicate a lower perceived stress level for this participant. The participant reports no substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs, all with significantly negative Z-scores, signifying a substantial deviation from population norms towards abstinence. Their engagement in organized exercise (exercised with others) is frequent (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23), suggesting a structured approach to physical health. Critically, the participant reports a very low frequency of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 0.0, Z-score of -1.38) and is classified as ""not anxious"" based on the STAI trait measure (Z-score of -1.71). Subjective sleep quality is also rated as good (PSQI score of 4.0, Z-score of -1.26). The participant's academic performance is consistently high, with GPAs above 3.88 across multiple semesters. Furthermore, the participant exhibits a significantly lower than average resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z-score of -1.18) and a lower than average Mesor (65.92, Z-score of -1.1), which are generally indicative of good cardiovascular health and potentially lower physiological stress. The low intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.74) and relatively stable autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of -0.11) also suggest a more regular and less disrupted physiological rhythm. The hourly heart rate deviations reveal a notable pattern of lower than average heart rate during nighttime hours (e.g., 12-1 am Z-score of -2.6, 1-2 am Z-score of -2.18), indicating efficient recovery and potentially deep sleep, which is further supported by the consistent sleep start time and lower than average sleep duration variability.

Overall, when synthesizing these multimodal data points, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is inferred to be **below the population mean**. While the shorter sleep duration is a notable concern and a potential stressor, it is significantly outweighed by the consistently low scores in depression and anxiety, excellent academic performance, absence of substance use, and favorable physiological indicators such as low resting heart rate and Mesor, and regular circadian rhythm metrics. These factors collectively suggest a robust capacity for stress management and a generally low level of perceived stress."
45963,"The participant exhibits a constellation of psychological and behavioral indicators that suggest a relatively elevated level of perceived stress. This is supported by high scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), with a Z-score of 2.05, placing them significantly above the population mean for trait anxiety. Similarly, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 22.0 indicates a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, further aligning with a higher stress experience. Subjective well-being is also impacted, as evidenced by a low self-reported happiness score (Z-score of -1.61), which correlates negatively with perceived stress. Additionally, the participant reports moderately disturbed sleep quality as measured by the PSQI (Z-score of 0.13), though this score is close to the population mean. The negative correlation between self-esteem and perceived stress (-0.15), coupled with a below-average self-esteem score (Z-score of -1.15), suggests that lower self-worth may contribute to heightened stress.

Behavioral patterns and physiological data also provide insights into the participant's stress profile. The wearable data reveals a notably irregular circadian rhythm, characterized by a very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -2.06), indicating a lack of daily regularity in physiological patterns. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also significantly low (Z-score of -2.13), suggesting a dampened daily fluctuation in physiological activity. The participant's sleep patterns are also irregular, with a high standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score of 2.89), indicating significant variability in their sleep schedule. While median sleep duration is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.64), the variability in sleep timing appears to be a more prominent factor. Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the population mean (Z-score of 1.2). The hourly deviations from the heart rate mesor suggest increased physiological arousal during later morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score of 1.24) and in the early evening (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score of -2.12, and 7-8 PM, Z-score of -1.99, showing reduced deviation). Conversely, there is significant physiological activation during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 3-6 AM, where the deviation from the mesor becomes increasingly negative, suggesting a state of reduced cardiovascular activity during these sleep periods.

In summary, the participant's profile is characterized by elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and happiness, and a highly irregular sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm. These factors collectively suggest that the participant experiences a relatively high level of perceived stress. Comparing the participant's overall perceived stress level to the study population, the mean PSS score of the study sample is 21.61, with a standard deviation of 3.68. Given the constellation of elevated anxiety, depressive symptoms, and disrupted circadian rhythms, it is reasonable to infer that this participant's overall perceived stress level is likely **above the population mean**."
22138,"The participant’s self-reported data suggests a moderate level of perceived stress. While scores on the CES-D scale (M=15.0) fall within the ""Not depressed"" classification, indicating a generally low burden of depressive symptoms, the STAI-Trait anxiety score (M=50.0) is classified as ""anxious"" and is notably above the population mean for this study. This heightened chronic anxiety, evidenced by a Z-score of 0.86, is positively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem scores (M=42.0) are not directly comparable to the 10-40 scale for RSES and thus cannot be definitively interpreted for stress. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (M=5.0, Z-Score=-0.8), suggesting that sleep disturbances are not a primary contributor to elevated stress levels. Furthermore, the participant reports generally higher levels of trust (M=2.83, Z-Score=-0.78) and happiness (M=3.0, Z-Score=-0.53), with negative correlations to PSS, indicating these factors may buffer against stress. Lifestyle behaviors reveal moderate substance usage (wine/liquor 1-2 times/week) and consistent social exercise (three times a week or more), which are generally associated with lower stress. However, the participant also reports higher than average internet usage and reading time, which could indicate more sedentary or introspective activities that might correlate with stress for some individuals.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological data reveals a more complex picture regarding daily physiological patterns. The participant exhibits a relatively higher mesor (M=77.51, Z-Score=0.49) and amplitude (M=13.05, Z-Score=0.73) in their heart rate circadian rhythm, suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, occurs relatively late in the afternoon (4:20 PM), which is typical. However, the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of elevated heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM: 17.25, Z-Score=0.82; 7-8 PM: 14.02, Z-Score=0.44). These elevated deviations correlate positively with perceived stress, suggesting physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, during the late night and early morning hours, heart rate deviations are notably lower than the mesor (e.g., 3-4 AM: -21.12, Z-Score=-0.76), which is expected during sleep. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 32 minutes, which is within a healthy range and slightly above average for the study population (Z-Score=0.43), and a relatively stable sleep start time (Standard Deviation=121 minutes, Z-Score=0.83), indicating consistency in sleep patterns. The intraday variability of heart rate is lower than average (M=0.47, Z-Score=-0.53), which could suggest a more stable physiological rhythm, often associated with lower stress.

Overall, the participant’s perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean** for the study sample. This inference is primarily driven by the elevated STAI-Trait anxiety scores, which have a positive correlation with perceived stress. While self-reported sleep quality, trust, and happiness suggest buffering factors, and objective sleep duration is adequate, the physiological data indicates periods of heightened cardiovascular arousal, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, which also correlate with higher perceived stress. The presence of higher chronic anxiety and specific periods of physiological arousal, despite generally good subjective sleep and positive social habits, points towards a level of perceived stress that is likely above the average for this academic cohort."
31439,"This participant exhibits a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is likely above the population mean, considering the collective evidence. Several self-reported survey measures suggest elevated levels of psychological distress. Specifically, the participant reports moderate levels of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 16.0, which falls within the ""Depressed"" classification. Furthermore, the participant scores 49.0 on the STAI-Trait scale, classifying them as ""anxious,"" and this score is notably above the population mean for chronic anxiety proneness. While self-esteem is within the average range (Score: 39.0), and health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score: 3.67), the combined indicators of depression and anxiety point towards a higher perceived stress experience.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported as 1-2 times per week, and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Their exercise habits involve engaging in physical activity alone and with others 1-2 times per week, with less frequent participation in sports. Daily recreational habits show higher than average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours) and moderate internet usage. Notably, the participant reports significant time spent reading (16-30 minutes), which has a negative correlation with PSS scores, suggesting this habit may be stress-mitigating for this individual.

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates an elevated resting heart rate (Value: 78.2, Z-Score: 2.38), and a higher than average Mesor (Value: 91.39, Z-Score: 2.38). The intraday variability of heart rate is lower than the population average (Value: 0.37, Z-Score: -1.24), suggesting a less dynamic cardiovascular response throughout the day. Sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 41 minutes, which is below the average, and a sleep start time around 12:39 AM. The standard deviation in sleep duration is slightly elevated, and the sleep start time is also more variable than average. The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep, aligning with the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification. Overall, the combination of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, alongside physiological indicators of elevated arousal and suboptimal sleep patterns, strongly suggests a PSS score that is above the population mean of 21.61."
46558,"The provided data suggests a moderate level of perceived stress for this participant, falling near the population mean for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This inference is derived from a synthesis of self-report measures, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data, analyzed in conjunction with their correlations to PSS scores.

Several factors indicate a potentially lower perceived stress level. The participant reports a relatively high level of self-esteem (Z-Score = -0.45), a positive indicator of well-being. They also report a low frequency of anxiety symptoms (STAI Z-Score = -0.43), suggesting a generally calm disposition. Furthermore, the participant's subjective sleep quality is assessed as good by the PSQI (Z-Score = -0.8), and they report experiencing good overall health satisfaction (Z-Score = 0.8). This participant also engages in a considerable amount of video gaming (Z-Score = 3.23), which may serve as a form of stress relief or engagement. The absence of recreational drug use and infrequent alcohol consumption also points towards healthier coping mechanisms. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a resting heart rate (Z-Score = 0.3) that is slightly above the population average, but their mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle) is near the population mean (Z-Score = -0.09), indicating a stable baseline cardiovascular function. The median sleep duration is also within a healthy range (Z-Score = -0.12), and sleep start times are relatively consistent (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score = -0.61).

Conversely, certain data points may suggest areas of potential stress or less adaptive behaviors. The participant's CES-D score indicates a moderate level of depressive symptoms (Z-Score = 0.38), which, while not meeting the classification for ""Depressed"" by the provided criteria for this specific scale, is elevated. Their reported happiness level is notably high (Z-Score = 1.64), which might be a compensatory factor or indicate a generally optimistic outlook despite other potential stressors. The participant engages in significant amounts of sedentary activities, such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score = 1.28), internet usage (Z-Score = 0.85), and spending time on sedentary hobbies (Z-Score = 2.01), with minimal engagement in physical exercise, including sports and exercising alone or with others (low Z-scores for frequency). The high intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-Score = 0.32) suggests some degree of physiological fluctuation throughout the day, though this metric is not strongly correlated with PSS. The circadian rhythm metric of Interdaily Stability is somewhat low (Z-Score = 0.83), indicating less regularity in daily patterns, which has a negative correlation with PSS. The participant's GPA has declined over the assessed periods, with the most recent Fall 2016 GPA at 2.6, suggesting potential academic pressures.

In conclusion, while the participant exhibits several positive indicators of well-being, such as high self-esteem, low reported anxiety, and good subjective sleep quality, the presence of moderate depressive symptoms, limited physical activity, and declining academic performance suggest that perceived stress levels are not significantly below average. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean."
93699,"This analysis examines perceived stress (PSS) through a multimodal lens, integrating self-report surveys, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics. The participant's PSS score appears to be near the population mean. Several factors suggest a potentially higher level of perceived stress. Subjective reports indicate disturbed sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 9.0, falling above the commonly cited threshold of 5 and exhibiting a positive Z-score of 1.05 relative to the study population. This is further supported by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -0.42). While subjective happiness is reported as moderate (Z-score of -0.53), the STAI trait anxiety score of 44.0 is classified as anxious and has a positive Z-score of 0.27, suggesting a predisposition towards higher anxiety. Increased daily internet usage (Z-score of 2.19) and watching TV/videos/movies for 1-2 hours (Z-score of 1.28) are notable behavioral patterns, potentially indicative of engagement in sedentary activities that can sometimes be associated with stress coping mechanisms.

Conversely, several indicators suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 8.0, Z-score of -0.55) and a moderate level of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 35.0, Z-score of -0.45). Their academic performance, as reflected in their GPA (averaging 3.4), is strong, which can be a source of confidence and stability. While overall sleep duration is somewhat limited, the variability in sleep start time (Z-score of 0.14) and duration (Z-score of 0.16) are not substantially elevated, suggesting a degree of regularity in sleep scheduling. Furthermore, the participant engages in exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.53), a behavior positively associated with well-being. Physiological data reveals a relatively stable circadian rhythm, with moderate intraday variability (Z-score of -0.11) and a mesor (average heart rate) value of 79.36 (Z-score of 0.74) which is within a typical range. The acrophase, indicating the peak of the circadian rhythm, occurs at 4:00 PM, which aligns with typical daily activity patterns.

In conclusion, while indicators such as disturbed sleep quality and elevated trait anxiety suggest potential contributions to perceived stress, other factors like good academic performance, low depressive symptoms, and regular social exercise offer a counterbalance. Considering the totality of the data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. The positive correlations with STAI and PSQI, coupled with negative correlations with happiness and reading, provide some support for this interpretation. However, the correlations are generally weak, highlighting the complex interplay of these factors."
84011,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data provide initial insights into their stress levels. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population mean is 21.62. The participant reports a current happiness score of 4.0, which is above the population mean for happiness (Z-score of 0.55), and a health satisfaction score of 5.0, also above the population mean (Z-score of 0.55). These scores suggest a potentially lower perception of stress. Furthermore, the participant's self-esteem score of 33.0 is near the upper range of the scale, indicating positive self-worth, and their CES-D score of 6.0 suggests a low level of depressive symptoms, classifying them as ""Not depressed"" and below the population average for depressive symptoms. Their STAI-Trait score of 44.0 indicates a moderate level of chronic anxiety, which is close to the population mean, and has a weak positive correlation with PSS. The PSQI score of 6.0 suggests disturbed sleep, which is slightly below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance but falls within a range that can be associated with increased stress.

The participant's behavioral habits also offer context for their stress perception. Notably, they engage in regular exercise, with a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" for both exercising with others (Z-score of 1.23) and participating in sports (Z-score of 1.58), indicating a healthy and active lifestyle. This consistent physical activity is often associated with stress reduction. Their substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of beer or recreational drugs. Regarding daily recreation, they report spending between ""16-30 minutes"" on activities like watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and socializing with friends, but actively do not engage in video games or listening to music. Their reading time is also reported as ""Do not do"". The limited engagement in passive leisure activities like watching TV and reading, coupled with moderate socializing, could suggest a preference for more active or social engagement.

The wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data reveal several patterns. The participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate of 51.4 bpm (Z-score of -0.8), suggesting good cardiovascular health. The mesor of their heart rate is also lower than the population average (Z-score of -1.48), further supporting this observation. Their sleep duration, with a median of 8 hours and 28 minutes (Z-score of 1.59), is notably longer than the population average, indicating sufficient sleep. The intradaily variability of their heart rate is high (Z-score of 1.02), which, in conjunction with a low interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.49), may indicate less consistent daily routines in terms of physiological activity patterns. A distinct pattern emerges in the Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor, with significant elevations in heart rate deviation during the evening hours, particularly between 8-9 PM (Z-score of 2.19). Conversely, the late-night hours (9-10 PM and 11 PM-12 AM) show substantial decreases in heart rate deviation (Z-scores of -2.18 and -1.13, respectively). The acrophase of their circadian rhythm is reported as 3:54 PM.

Considering the multimodal data, the participant appears to exhibit a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean. While several indicators, such as longer sleep duration, strong exercise habits, low depressive symptoms, and high self-esteem, suggest lower stress, their moderate anxiety levels (STAI-Trait) and disturbed sleep quality (PSQI) indicate potential areas of stress. The significant evening peak in heart rate deviation coupled with late-night dips also warrants attention, potentially reflecting periods of elevated physiological arousal or stress responses. The participant's overall profile, characterized by a blend of positive indicators and some potential stressors, suggests their perceived stress level is neither markedly high nor low relative to the study population."
88008,"The participant exhibits a complex profile that suggests a moderate level of perceived stress. Self-report data indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score of 0.7) and trait anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score of 0.66), both of which are positively correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Conversely, the participant reports high self-esteem (Z-score of -0.73), greater trust of others (Z-score of -0.78), and higher current happiness (Z-score of -0.53), all of which are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting buffering factors. Despite a high frequency of exercise, particularly sports, and engaging in reading for moderate durations, the participant also demonstrates a significant amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games. This combination of behaviors, alongside a lower-than-average PSQI score (indicating good subjective sleep quality), suggests that while proactive coping mechanisms like exercise are present, other activities may be less conducive to stress reduction.

Physiological data from wearable devices further illuminate the participant's stress profile. The interdaily stability of heart rate is notably low (Z-score of 0.91), indicating a lack of consistent daily rhythm in cardiovascular activity, which can be associated with higher stress. Conversely, intradaily variability is also low (Z-score of -1.73), suggesting a less dynamic cardiovascular response throughout the day, potentially reflecting reduced physiological reactivity in some contexts. The mesor of heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.61), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably high (Z-score of 1.48), implying a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate, which can be indicative of increased physiological strain. The acrophase occurring at 5:06 PM suggests a typical peak in heart rate during the late afternoon/early evening.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during the late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7 PM and 10 PM, with deviations reaching up to +19.47 and +17.8 respectively. These late-night elevations, along with the low median sleep duration (6 hours 9 minutes, Z-score of -1.29) and a very early median sleep start time (around 1:14 AM), suggest potential disruption in sleep patterns and likely contribute to perceived stress. The relatively low sleep duration and early start time, coupled with the observed elevated heart rate during typical sleep hours, are concerning indicators. Considering the population data, the participant's median sleep duration is substantially below the typical range, and the sleep start time is also outside the common pattern, suggesting a significant deviation from typical sleep habits.

Holistically, the participant's data suggests a PSS score that is likely above the population mean. The elevated levels of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with physiological indicators of disrupted circadian rhythm and elevated late-night heart rate, point towards significant perceived stress. While positive factors like high self-esteem and exercise engagement are present, they appear insufficient to fully mitigate the impact of other stressors and physiological dysregulation. The participant's PSS score is likely above the population mean of 21.62, falling into a range indicative of greater perceived stress."
83566,"The participant's psychological and behavioral data suggest a complex interplay of factors, with several indicators pointing towards elevated perceived stress levels, while others suggest relative stability. The participant reports significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 37.0, Z-score 2.47) and chronic anxiety (STAI-Trait score of 62.0, Z-score 2.05), both of which are substantially above population means and exhibit positive correlations with perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59), which is above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Subjective happiness is notably low, with a current happiness score of 2.0 (Z-score -1.61), which is significantly below the population average and shows a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress. While self-esteem is relatively preserved (SelfEsteem score of 29.0, Z-Score -1.29), it is below the population average, and trust in others is near the population mean (Trust score of 3.33, Z-Score 0.18). Health satisfaction is also near the population mean (Score of 3.78, z-score -0.37).

Physiological data reveal a higher-than-average mesor (heart rate at rest) of 84.83 bpm (Z-score 1.49), suggesting a generally elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. This is complemented by a higher-than-average resting heart rate of 69.4 bpm (Z-score 1.34). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate heightened physiological arousal during several periods throughout the day, particularly in the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, deviation of -12.44, Z-score 0.62; 4-5 AM, deviation of -15.87, Z-score 0.37; 5-6 AM, deviation of -18.19, Z-score 0.02; 6-7 AM, deviation of -17.67, Z-score -0.06) and in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 2-3 PM, deviation of 11.57, Z-score 0.84; 6-7 PM, deviation of 11.66, Z-score -0.14). While the mesor and some hourly deviations suggest increased physiological arousal, the overall circadian rhythm stability, as indicated by interdaily stability (0.42, Z-Score 0.09) and intradaily variability (0.58, Z-Score 0.24), is near population averages, suggesting some structure in daily physiological patterns. Sleep duration is longer than average (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-Score 1.18), but the standard deviation of sleep duration is within the population range, and sleep start times are also relatively stable.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, appears to be above the population mean. This inference is primarily driven by the high scores in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and disturbed sleep quality, coupled with lower-than-average happiness and a higher baseline heart rate. While some behavioral and physiological metrics indicate relative stability, the strong indicators of psychological distress and physiological arousal during specific times of day suggest a significant burden of perceived stress."
87032,"The participant exhibits several characteristics that suggest a potentially elevated level of perceived stress. Self-reported measures reveal a high burden of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 28.0, which is 1.53 standard deviations above the population mean and classified as ""Depressed."" Similarly, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0, also 1.52 standard deviations above the mean, signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance. Trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is at 44.0, reflecting moderate levels of chronic anxiety, though its z-score is relatively low at 0.27. In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant engages in high levels of sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (2-3 hours daily), internet usage (over 4 hours daily), and listening to music (over 4 hours daily), with z-scores of 1.91, 2.19, and 2.06 respectively. Additionally, reading time is notably high at 31 minutes to an hour, with a z-score of 2.28, and this metric shows a negative correlation with PSS. Conversely, the participant reports no engagement in exercising alone, with others, or sports.

Physiological data from wearable devices further supports the inference of higher stress. The mesor, an indicator of overall circadian rhythm level, is elevated at 85.35, with a z-score of 1.56, suggesting a higher average heart rate. Intradaily variability of heart rate is also high (0.75, z-score 1.44), indicating more fluctuations throughout the day. The resting heart rate is also elevated at 69.4, with a z-score of 1.34. The participant's sleep patterns show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes, which is below average (z-score -0.58), and a median sleep start time of 02:00:29, with a high standard deviation in sleep start time (145 minutes, z-score 1.36), indicating irregularity in sleep timing. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a generally higher arousal pattern during the late morning and afternoon, with positive deviations between 11 AM and 7 PM, peaking at 11.81 (z-score 0.53) between 1 PM and 2 PM and 10.37 (z-score 0.19) between 12 PM and 1 PM. There are also notable positive deviations in the early morning hours (2-6 AM) with significant deviations between 5-6 AM (-18.13, z-score 0.03) and 4-5 AM (-16.0, z-score 0.35), suggesting potential physiological arousal during typical sleep periods.

Conversely, some data points suggest lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is moderately high with a score of 36.0 (z-score -0.31), indicating a positive self-worth. Similarly, self-reported happiness is at 3.0 (z-score -0.53), which, while not exceptionally high, is also not indicative of significant distress. Health satisfaction is also moderate with a score of 3.56 (z-score -0.53). Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, is reported as minimal to none, with negative z-scores indicating lower than average usage. The interdaily stability of the heart rate is low (0.27, z-score -1.15), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (0.1, z-score -1.87), which might suggest a less rigid, and potentially less stressed, circadian rhythm in some aspects, though this contrasts with other circadian metrics.

Overall, the participant's data points towards a perceived stress level that is likely **above the population mean**. The significant elevations in depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, sedentary behaviors, and physiological arousal indicators like higher mesor and intradaily variability in heart rate, alongside shorter and more erratic sleep durations, collectively paint a picture of elevated stress. While the participant maintains moderate self-esteem and happiness, these are overshadowed by the more robust indicators of psychological and physiological distress."
94641,"The participant's data suggests a complex interplay of factors potentially influencing perceived stress. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 29.0, Z-score of 1.63) and trait anxiety (STAI score of 54.0, Z-score of 1.25) are notable. These findings are positively correlated with perceived stress, indicating that higher symptom burden in these domains may contribute to a greater perception of stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score of 1.52), which is well above the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and is also positively correlated with perceived stress. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, with a standard deviation of 168 minutes, suggests a pattern of insufficient and variable sleep, further contributing to a potentially higher stress load. The relatively high Mesor (83.09, Z-score of 1.25) and resting heart rate (70.3, Z-score of 1.44) also point towards a generally elevated physiological state.

Conversely, certain factors suggest potential resilience or lower perceived stress. The participant reports moderate happiness (Current score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55), which is positively correlated with perceived stress, implying that higher reported happiness may be associated with lower stress. Self-esteem is within the average range (Score of 32.0, Z-score of -0.87), and trust in others is also within the average range (Score of 2.83, Z-score of -0.78), with negative correlations to perceived stress, suggesting that higher levels of self-esteem and trust might be associated with lower perceived stress. The participant also indicates no substance usage and minimal engagement in formal exercise, which, while potentially indicating avoidance of certain stressors, also means these common coping mechanisms are not being utilized. Some sedentary habits, such as extended video game usage (1-2 hours) and sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours), are present and are negatively correlated with perceived stress.

Considering the convergence of elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and disturbed sleep, alongside physiological markers of higher arousal such as Mesor and resting heart rate, the data strongly suggests that this participant is experiencing a relatively high level of perceived stress. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, falling below recommended levels, further supports this conclusion. This perceived stress level is **above the population mean**, as the participant's PSS score (inferred from the composite of these metrics) is likely influenced by multiple factors that are positively associated with higher stress. The moderate self-esteem and trust levels, alongside reported happiness, may offer some buffer but do not appear to fully offset the impact of the more significant stressors indicated in the data."
82728,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a generally stable psychological state with relatively low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and moderate self-esteem. The STAI Trait score of 39.0 and CES-D score of 11.0 are both below the population mean for average levels of chronic anxiety and depressive symptomatology, respectively. Similarly, the Self-Esteem score of 37.0 indicates a good level of self-worth, and the participant reports a high level of happiness (Z-score of -0.53). Health satisfaction is also reported as relatively high (Z-score of -0.45). Notably, substance usage across all categories (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""Not at all,"" which is significantly lower than the population average (Z-scores ranging from -0.31 to -1.3). Regarding daily recreation, the participant engages in moderate exercise, specifically exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), and exercises with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.53). However, engagement in sports is ""Not at all"" (Z-score of -1.09). Time spent on sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games is relatively low, while internet usage and listening to music are within moderate ranges. Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes to an hour, and reading is reported as ""Do not do."" These behavioral patterns, particularly the low substance usage and consistent exercise, may be indicative of proactive stress management strategies, potentially contributing to lower perceived stress.

The participant's sleep and circadian rhythm data present a mixed picture. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 59 minutes is slightly below the typical recommendation, and its Z-score of -0.25 suggests it is slightly shorter than the population average. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, while not extremely high, indicates disturbed sleep according to the provided interpretation threshold. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm metrics reveal some interesting patterns. The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably high (Z-score of 1.54), suggesting a substantial variation in heart rate throughout the day. Interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.75) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of 1.06) are relatively high, indicating a structured and regular daily rhythm in heart rate. However, the Intradaily Variability is lower than the population average (Z-score of -0.53), suggesting less fluctuation within the day. The Mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly elevated above the population mean (Z-score of 0.35). The analysis of Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor shows a pattern of significantly lower heart rates during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-6 AM, with deviations ranging from -16.52 to -20.9), followed by a marked increase in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and early evening (peaking at 5-6 PM with a deviation of 27.42). This pattern could reflect periods of increased physiological arousal or activity during these times. The relatively low sleep duration and disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, might contribute to heightened perceived stress.

In summary, while the participant exhibits positive self-reported traits and healthy behaviors such as low substance usage and regular exercise, which could buffer against stress, indicators from wearable data suggest potential challenges in sleep quality and a robust diurnal heart rate variation. The high amplitude and significant positive deviations in heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening, coupled with slightly reduced sleep duration and disturbed sleep quality, may contribute to perceived stress. Despite these potential stressors, the overall pattern of data, considering the low anxiety and depressive symptoms, suggests that the participant's perceived stress level is likely near the population mean. The study population has a mean PSS score of 21.61, with a 50th percentile of 22.0. Based on the provided data, it is not possible to definitively state whether this participant's PSS score is above, near, or below the population mean without the direct PSS score. However, the absence of significant negative indicators in self-report measures, balanced by the mixed findings from wearable data, points towards a moderate perceived stress level."
45076,"The participant's self-reported data indicate several psychological and behavioral patterns that may be associated with perceived stress. A notable finding is the participant's elevated score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), with a Z-score of 0.27, suggesting a higher than average proneness to chronic anxiety within the study population. This aligns with a moderate CES-D score (Z-score: 0.18), indicating a slight tendency towards depressive symptoms, and a significant correlation (0.28) between CES-D and PSS score which suggests that depressive symptoms may contribute to perceived stress. Conversely, the participant reports higher than average self-esteem (Z-score: 1.38) and trust of others (Z-score: 0.83), which are generally associated with lower perceived stress and show weak negative correlations with PSS. Furthermore, a lower than average reported happiness score (Z-score: -0.53) with a negative correlation to PSS (-0.19) suggests that lower happiness may be associated with higher perceived stress. The participant's health satisfaction is also below the population average (Z-score: -0.95), with a weak negative correlation to PSS.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in frequent exercise, both alone (Z-score: 1.07) and with others (Z-score: 1.23), and participates in sports more than three times a week (Z-score: 1.58). These active lifestyle choices have a weak to moderate negative correlation with PSS, suggesting they may serve as a buffer against stress. However, the participant's leisure activities show a mixed profile. While recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28) and socializing with friends (Z-score: 0.16) are engaged in for moderate durations, there is very low internet usage (Z-score: -1.83) and no engagement in video games, listening to music, or reading for leisure. The low internet usage shows a positive correlation with PSS, implying it might be a stressor, whereas reading for leisure shows a negative correlation. Alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, is moderate (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94), while beer and recreational drug usage are reported as ""Not at all"".

Analysis of wearable data reveals patterns in circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The participant exhibits relatively stable sleep duration (Z-score: -0.10) and a median sleep start time of 00:57:00, with a standard deviation suggesting some variability in sleep timing (Z-score: -0.44). However, the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep quality (Z-score: -0.33). The overall circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -0.74) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 0.81), suggests some potential disruption in daily rhythmicity, with lower stability and higher autocorrelation. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.49), as is the amplitude (Z-score: -0.44), suggesting a generally lower average heart rate and smaller diurnal variation. The resting heart rate is near the population average (Z-score: -0.04).

Examining the hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor provides insight into daily physiological arousal patterns. A significant peak in heart rate deviation is observed in the late afternoon and early evening, specifically between 3-4 PM (Z-score: 1.48) and 4-5 PM (Z-score: 2.40), indicating heightened cardiovascular activity during these periods. There is also an elevated deviation between 8-9 PM (Z-score: 0.99). Conversely, the late-night and early-morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM to 5-6 AM) show consistently negative deviations, signifying lower than average heart rate during these times, likely reflecting a period of rest and recovery. The correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are generally weak, with a few exceptions such as the 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM deviations showing positive correlations, suggesting that elevated heart rate during these early morning hours may be associated with higher perceived stress, though these correlations are not the strongest overall.

In summary, the participant's profile suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing perceived stress. Elevated anxiety, moderate depressive symptoms, and below-average happiness and health satisfaction lean towards a higher perceived stress level. These are partially counterbalanced by high self-esteem and trust, along with frequent engagement in physical activity. The disturbed sleep quality is a potential contributor to stress. The significant elevation in heart rate during the late afternoon and early evening, coupled with a general tendency towards higher anxiety, points towards a participant experiencing a relatively high level of perceived stress. Compared to the study population mean of 21.6, the participant's perceived stress level is likely **above the population mean**."
44872,"The participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the provided data, appears to be *above the population mean*. This is supported by several indicators within the self-report surveys and wearable metrics.

Self-reported measures suggest a moderate level of well-being, with a relatively low CES-D score (5.0) indicating minimal depressive symptoms and an STAI score (39.0) suggesting a low trait anxiety proneness. The participant reports high self-esteem (43.0) and a generally positive perception of their health (Health Satisfaction Score: 6.0). However, a higher-than-average Z-score for happiness (1.64) might suggest an effort to present positively, or it could reflect genuine positive affect. Notably, the PSQI score of 6.0, exceeding the commonly accepted threshold of 5, indicates disturbed sleep quality. This subjective sleep disturbance is accompanied by a high Z-score for sleep start time standard deviation (1.55), suggesting significant variability in when the participant goes to sleep, and a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 58 minutes, which is slightly below the population average, as indicated by its negative Z-score (-0.27).

Physiological data derived from the wearable device reveals a low Mesor (61.84) with a significant negative Z-score (-1.65), which can reflect a generally lower basal heart rate. However, the data also indicates a high intraday variability (0.61) with a positive Z-score (0.46), and a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.16) with a negative Z-score (-1.37). These metrics collectively point towards less stable and less predictable daily physiological rhythms. Furthermore, the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct patterns: significantly elevated heart rates during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, with a deviation of 32.46 and a Z-score of 3.2) and a pronounced dip during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, with a deviation of -13.49 and a Z-score of -1.66). This pattern of significant deviations during specific times of day, particularly the pronounced elevations in the evening, can be indicative of physiological responses to stress or anticipation. While some lifestyle factors like frequent alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor usage: ""Three times a week or more"" with Z-scores of 1.72 and 1.68 respectively) and moderate social engagement (Socializing with Friends: ""2-3 hours"" with a Z-score of 0.95) are noted, their correlations with PSS are weak and generally negative, suggesting they may not be primary drivers of perceived stress in this individual. The lower-than-average interdaily stability (0.29) with a Z-score of -0.99 further suggests a less structured daily routine.

In summary, while self-reported markers of anxiety and depression are low, the presence of disturbed sleep, high variability in sleep timing, and irregular physiological rhythms, coupled with significant deviations in hourly heart rate, particularly during the late afternoon and evening, suggest an underlying elevated level of perceived stress. These physiological and sleep patterns, when considered in conjunction with the population statistics, indicate that the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely above the population mean."
27306,"The participant’s perceived stress level, as inferred from the integrated data, appears to be **near the population mean** for the study sample. While several self-reported psychological and behavioral indicators suggest a relatively lower perceived stress, physiological and behavioral patterns also indicate periods of heightened arousal that warrant consideration.

Several self-reported measures point towards lower perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively low frequency of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.76) and classifies as ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (Score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.43). Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI score of 4.0, Z-Score of -1.26), and self-reported happiness is near the population average (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z-Score of -0.53). The participant also exhibits high self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 50.0, Z-Score of 1.66), which often correlates with lower stress perception. Lifestyle factors such as infrequent substance usage and consistent engagement in exercise, both alone and with others, suggest a generally healthy behavioral profile. Notably, the participant’s health satisfaction is high (Score of 6.67, Z-score of 1.8), further supporting a profile of lower perceived stress.

Conversely, some physiological and behavioral metrics suggest potential contributors to perceived stress or indicate periods of heightened activation. The participant's sleep duration is slightly below average (Median Sleep Duration of 6 hours 42 minutes, Z-Score of -0.6), and the average deviation of heart rate from the mesor indicates significant periods of elevated cardiovascular activity, particularly between 4-5 PM (Value of 61.42, Z-Score of 7.8) and 7-8 AM (Value of 34.91, Z-Score of 5.17). The Mesor itself (Value of 63.03, Z-Score of -1.49) and Resting Heart Rate (Value of 46.2, Z-Score of -1.42) are lower than average, suggesting a potentially more sensitive physiological baseline. Intradaily variability in heart rate is also higher than the population average (Value of 0.59, Z-Score of 0.32), indicating more fluctuation throughout the day. Additionally, the participant spends considerable time engaged with the internet (Internet Usage Time of 15 minutes or less, Z-Score of -1.83), which, while not directly indicative of stress, can be a behavioral correlate of how time is managed. The relatively low Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value of 0.28, Z-Score of -0.36) and Interdaily Stability (Value of 0.38, Z-Score of -0.24) suggest a less predictable daily rhythm, which could be a factor in stress management.

In conclusion, the combination of positive self-reported psychological states and healthy lifestyle behaviors suggests a lower stress burden. However, the physiological indicators of heightened arousal during specific times of the day and a less stable daily rhythm suggest that the participant may experience periods of elevated physiological activation, potentially contributing to a perceived stress level that is around the average for this academic population."
46365,"The participant's psychological and behavioral data suggest a moderate perceived stress level, likely falling near the population mean for perceived stress. While certain indicators point towards elements that could contribute to higher stress, several other factors suggest a generally stable and well-regulated state.

Several self-reported survey metrics indicate a potential for higher perceived stress. The participant reported a score of 45.0 on the STAI-Trait anxiety scale, which places them in the 'anxious' classification and is above the population mean Z-score for this measure. This suggests a disposition towards higher levels of chronic anxiety. Furthermore, the participant reports frequent beer consumption, occurring ""Three times a week or more,"" a pattern with a Z-score of 1.72, indicating significantly higher usage compared to the study population. High internet usage, exceeding 4 hours daily (Z-score 2.19), and extensive socializing with friends, also exceeding 4 hours daily (Z-score 2.53), represent significant time commitments that could potentially encroach on other restorative activities or contribute to a feeling of being overextended, although the correlation of these specific habits with perceived stress is relatively weak. The higher end of the PSS interquartile range is 24.0, and a Z-score for STAI of 0.37, along with other indicators, suggests the participant may be experiencing stress levels within or slightly above the typical range.

Conversely, several data points suggest factors that likely mitigate or reduce perceived stress. The participant demonstrates excellent academic performance, maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.8, indicating better than average sleep quality. While the median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes is only slightly above average (Z-score 0.11), the standard deviation for sleep duration (91 minutes) and sleep start time (62 minutes) are within typical ranges, suggesting a degree of consistency in sleep patterns. Resting heart rate at 55.8 bpm is below the population mean (Z-score -0.28), often associated with better cardiovascular health and lower physiological stress. The participant also reports high self-esteem (Score of 40.0, the maximum possible) and a generally positive outlook on their physical health (Z-score -1.45, indicating satisfaction above the population mean). The absence of recreational drug use and infrequent use of wine or liquor also aligns with healthier lifestyle choices.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While the elevated trait anxiety score and high beer consumption are noteworthy indicators that could contribute to increased stress, they are counterbalanced by strong academic performance, good subjective sleep quality, a healthy resting heart rate, high self-esteem, and positive health satisfaction. The data suggests a complex interplay of factors, with neither consistently high nor consistently low perceived stress being overwhelmingly indicated."
23287,"This participant presents a complex profile with indicators suggesting both reduced and elevated perceived stress. On the one hand, several self-reported measures point towards a lower-stress state. The participant reports a good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a low Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (3.0, Z-score -1.72), classifying their sleep as ""Good Sleep."" Furthermore, their trait anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score -0.43) and depressive symptoms (CESD score of 6.0, Z-score -0.76) are within non-anxious and not depressed classifications, respectively. Self-esteem is near the population mean (Z-score -0.03), and general happiness is also reported as being below the mean (Z-score -0.53).

Conversely, several behavioral and physiological metrics suggest a potentially higher perceived stress level, or at least a state of heightened arousal. The participant exhibits a notably low resting heart rate (40.6 bpm, Z-score -2.09) and a lower than average Mesor (57.82, Z-score -2.2), which could indicate a more parasympathetic-dominant baseline. However, the significant deviations from the mesor during certain hours, particularly in the late evening (10-11 PM with a Z-score of 2.37 and 9-10 PM with a Z-score of 2.09), suggest notable physiological reactivity or arousal during those times. Furthermore, the participant engages in higher than average internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.52) and exercises with others more frequently than the average (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23). Their sleep duration is also significantly longer than the population mean (8 hours 23 minutes, Z-score 1.49), which, when combined with the late sleep start times, may indicate a disrupted or extended sleep schedule, despite good subjective quality. The presence of more naps (0.25, Z-score 2.07) also contributes to this pattern.

Holistically, considering the convergent evidence, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the mean** of the study sample. While the subjective reports lean towards lower stress, the physiological indicators of heightened arousal during specific evening hours and the behavioral patterns of increased internet usage and frequent social exercise, alongside a notably longer sleep duration and increased napping, suggest a nuanced state where periods of potential stress or engagement are present. The positive correlations between PSS and both STAI and CESD scores, while not extremely high, also suggest that higher perceived stress could be associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are not pronounced in this participant, further supporting a near-mean interpretation."
28247,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and physiological factors that likely contribute to their perceived stress levels. Self-reported data indicate a significant elevation in symptoms of depression (CES-D score: 29.0, Z-score: 1.63) and anxiety (STAI score: 61.0, Z-score: 1.95), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. This suggests a heightened vulnerability to stressors and potentially a lower baseline for emotional regulation. Concurrently, the participant reports relatively low self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: 31.0, Z-score: -1.01) and lower levels of trust (Trust score: 2.67, Z-score: -1.1), which may exacerbate feelings of stress and isolation. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Health Satisfaction score: 2.89, Z-score: -1.03). Despite these indicators, the participant reports relatively higher current happiness (Happy score: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55), which may suggest a capacity for positive affect that partially counterbalances negative psychological traits.

Behavioral patterns provide further insight into the participant's stress experience. The participant engages in significant amounts of passive leisure activities, spending over 4 hours daily listening to music and even more time socializing with friends. This high engagement in social interaction, while potentially a stress buffer, is also associated with a notable time commitment. Conversely, engagement in more active or effortful leisure, such as exercise and sports, is minimal to non-existent, with very low frequency for exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports. Internet usage is reported as very low (15 minutes or less), contrasting with substantial time spent on music and social interaction. Notably, the participant reports infrequent consumption of alcohol, with beer consumption less than 1-2 times a month and wine or liquor 1-2 times a month, and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs, indicating a lack of substance use as a coping mechanism.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal patterns suggestive of disrupted circadian rhythm and potentially elevated physiological arousal. The participant exhibits relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.48) and high intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.51) in their heart rate, indicating a less regular and more fluctuating daily physiological rhythm. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also significantly lower than the population average (Z-score: -1.61), which may suggest a reduced capacity for physiological adaptation or responsiveness. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes, which is below the general recommendation and associated with a negative Z-score (-0.94). More significantly, the median sleep start time is very late (01:03:49) with a high standard deviation (Z-score: 2.74), suggesting considerable variability and likely sleep displacement. This pattern of irregular sleep and disrupted circadian rhythm, combined with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, is likely contributing to a higher perceived stress level.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, inferred from the combination of psychological, behavioral, and physiological data, appears to be above the population mean PSS score. The elevated scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm regularity, strongly indicate a heightened stress response. While engagement in social activities might offer some buffering, the overall pattern points towards a significant burden of perceived stress that exceeds that of the average study participant."
72806,"This analysis examines perceived stress by integrating self-report, behavioral, and physiological data from a participant over an academic semester. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, while not explicitly provided, can be inferred to be above the population mean of 21.62. This inference is drawn from a pattern of several indicators, including elevated physiological arousal during specific periods and certain lifestyle choices.

Several self-reported survey measures suggest a generally positive psychological and lifestyle profile, potentially mitigating higher perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score -0.86) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score -0.82), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Self-esteem is also at the upper end of the scale (Score 39.0, Z-Score 0.11), indicating high self-worth. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (Score 5.0, Z-Score -0.8). Furthermore, the participant demonstrates healthy academic performance with GPAs consistently above 3.7, and reports higher trust (Score 3.67, Z-Score 0.83) and moderate happiness (Current 3.0, Z-Score -0.53). Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Score 3.33, Z-score -0.7). In terms of substance usage, the participant reports infrequent consumption of beer and wine/liquor (less than 1-2 times a month and 1-2 times a month, respectively) and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits include exercising alone 1-2 times a week, though participation in sports and exercising with others is less frequent. Daily recreational habits indicate moderate engagement with activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, socializing with friends, and reading, with a notable tendency towards less than 30 minutes spent on most of these activities daily, except for socializing with friends which is around 31 minutes to an hour.

Conversely, several wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics point towards factors that could contribute to elevated perceived stress. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits a mesor (average heart rate) of 72.0 (Z-score -0.27) and an amplitude of 12.52 (Z-score 0.56), with the acrophase occurring at 4:00 PM. While the mesor is close to the population mean, the amplitude is higher, suggesting a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate. Notably, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the evening hours. The period between 6-7 PM shows the largest positive deviation (25.34, Z-score 2.22), indicating a substantial surge in heart rate during this time, which is highly atypical and could reflect acute stress responses. Other significant positive deviations are observed between 3-4 PM (15.05, Z-score 1.11) and 9-10 PM (12.53, Z-score 0.78). Conversely, early morning hours (1-6 AM) show considerable negative deviations from the mesor, suggesting very low heart rates during sleep. Resting heart rate is 56.4 (Z-score -0.21), which is slightly below the average. Sleep duration is reported as a median of 7 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score 0.47), which is slightly longer than average, with a relatively low standard deviation of sleep duration (85 minutes, Z-score -0.36), indicating consistent sleep length. The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:29:45), with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time (68 minutes, Z-score -0.32). The mean daily naps are relatively low at 0.13 (Z-score 0.7), indicating minimal napping.

In summary, the participant presents a mixed profile. While self-reported measures of mental health, anxiety, and sleep quality are generally positive, suggesting good coping mechanisms and internal resources, the physiological data indicates periods of significant cardiovascular arousal, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening. The pronounced peak in heart rate deviation between 6-7 PM is a strong indicator of potential stress or heightened arousal during this time. The consistent and relatively long sleep duration and stable sleep start times are protective factors. However, the significant evening heart rate elevation, coupled with the overall pattern of the hourly deviations, suggests that the participant likely experiences a higher level of perceived stress than the average individual in this study, placing their PSS score above the population mean."
39146,"The participant exhibits several characteristics that may be associated with heightened perceived stress. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is classified as ""anxious,"" with a score of 42.0, which is near the population mean for this metric. The correlation of this score with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is 0.31, suggesting a positive relationship where higher trait anxiety is linked to higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports spending a notable amount of time on video games (1-2 hours), with a Z-score of 2.47, and internet usage (2-3 hours), with a Z-score of 0.85. While the direct correlation of video game usage to PSS is not strongly indicated by the provided correlation coefficient (-0.14), increased sedentary behaviors can sometimes be an indicator or coping mechanism for stress. The wearable data also reveals a higher than average resting heart rate (Mesor Z-score of 0.61, Resting Heart Rate Z-score of 0.86), which could reflect a state of heightened physiological arousal often associated with stress. The intradaily variability of heart rate is also above average (Z-score of 0.53), suggesting less consistent daily physiological patterns which may be indicative of stress. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes, which is below the average for the study population (Z-score of -0.47), and a higher than average standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of -0.89). This variability and shorter duration of sleep are frequently linked to increased perceived stress.

Conversely, certain indicators suggest a potentially lower level of perceived stress. The participant's CES-D score is 11.0, classified as ""Not depressed,"" with a Z-score of -0.24, and a positive correlation with PSS (0.28), indicating that lower depressive symptoms are associated with lower perceived stress. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is relatively high with a score of 43.0 (Z-Score of 0.68), although the correlation with PSS is negative (-0.16), suggesting higher self-esteem is associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is rated as good (Score of 5.0, Z-Score of -0.8), which is generally associated with lower stress levels. The participant also reports not engaging in any substance usage (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and very limited exercise, which, while potentially indicative of avoidance behaviors, means these common stressors are absent. Daily recreational habits include significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score of 1.13) and moderate time socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.16), which can be positive coping mechanisms. The participant's autocorrelation at 24 hours is also above average (Z-score of 1.15), suggesting a more regular daily rhythm in their physiological data.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While indicators such as higher trait anxiety, elevated resting heart rate, and sleep disturbances suggest a potential for elevated stress, these are counterbalanced by a lack of depressive symptoms, relatively good subjective sleep quality, and higher self-esteem. The overall pattern indicates a moderate level of perceived stress that is not significantly deviating from the average within the study sample."
67918,"The participant presents with a complex profile of behaviors and physiological metrics that collectively inform an assessment of their perceived stress. Notably, self-reported measures indicate a generally favorable psychological disposition. The CES-D score of 5.0 suggests a low frequency of depressive symptoms, falling significantly below the population mean (indicated by a Z-score of -0.86). Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 35.0, with a Z-score of -0.62, suggests a lower than average proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is robust at a score of 48.0, and a Z-score of 1.38 indicates it is above the population mean. Health satisfaction also leans positive, with a score of 5.89 (Z-score 1.22) indicating a high level of satisfaction with physical health. These self-reported factors collectively suggest a baseline of psychological resilience.

Further examination of lifestyle and behavioral patterns reveals a generally healthy and regulated lifestyle, which may contribute to lower perceived stress. The participant reports no substance usage of beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, with consistently low Z-scores across these categories. Exercise habits, while not frequent (1-2 times a month for exercising alone and with others, and never participating in sports), show low negative correlations with PSS, suggesting this limited activity is not a significant stressor. Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement with watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, and higher engagement with listening to music and socializing with friends. Importantly, activities like reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for shorter durations, and reading shows a negative correlation with PSS. The PSQI score of 3.0 indicates good subjective sleep quality, and a Z-score of -1.72 places this well within the superior range of the population, suggesting good sleep hygiene.

Physiological data from wearable devices supports the interpretation of good regulatory capacity and potentially lower stress. The circadian rhythm metrics reveal a high degree of regularity and structure. Interdaily stability (0.59, Z-score 1.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.52, Z-score 1.65) are significantly higher than the population mean, indicating a robust daily rhythm. The amplitude (15.71, Z-score 1.59) is also notably elevated, suggesting a larger diurnal variation in heart rate, which can be indicative of a healthy physiological response to daily demands. The MESOR, representing the average circadian rhythm, is 81.27 (Z-score 1.0), indicating an average heart rate that is slightly above the population average but well within a healthy range. Intradaily variability (0.37, Z-score -1.24) is lower than the population average, suggesting less erratic fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. Sleep statistics further reinforce this picture of good physiological regulation, with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 42 minutes (Z-score 1.88), significantly longer than the population average, and a low standard deviation for sleep duration and start time. The absence of daily naps and the median sleep start time of 23:38:52 also point towards consistent sleep patterns.

Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight periods of physiological arousal that are generally well-modulated. Significant positive deviations, indicating higher than average heart rate for that hour, occur during the afternoon, peaking between 1-2 PM (19.37, Z-score 1.95) and 2-3 PM (19.68, Z-score 2.34). These peak elevations, while statistically significant compared to the mesor, do not show strong negative correlations with PSS, suggesting they are within a range that does not significantly contribute to perceived stress. Conversely, the late evening and early morning hours exhibit more pronounced negative deviations, indicating periods of lower than average heart rate, consistent with rest and sleep. The negative correlations of several late-night and early-morning hourly deviations with PSS (e.g., 12-1am: -0.08, 1-2am: 0.05) suggest that lower heart rate during these periods may be associated with lower perceived stress.

Overall, the participant's data suggests a profile of relatively low perceived stress. This is supported by positive self-reported mental health indicators, healthy lifestyle choices, robust circadian rhythm regulation, and consistent sleep patterns. While there are periods of elevated heart rate during the afternoon, these do not appear to be a significant contributor to perceived stress, and the overall pattern of physiological and behavioral data points towards effective stress management. The population mean PSS score is 21.62, with a standard deviation of 3.68. Given the predominantly positive indicators and the lack of strong correlations suggesting high stress, it is inferred that the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely **below the population mean**."
34467,"This analysis examines perceived stress by integrating self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) serves as the central measure, with the participant's score interpreted in relation to the study population's mean PSS of 21.61.

**Indicators Suggesting Relatively High Perceived Stress:**

Several metrics suggest the participant may be experiencing a higher level of perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, with a Z-score of 0.59, indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a common correlate of increased stress. The PSQI score above 5 suggests clinically significant sleep disturbance. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a high Intradaily Variability (Z-score of 1.44), which can be indicative of physiological dysregulation and potentially heightened arousal or stress throughout the day. The Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor for the 7-8 AM hour (Z-score of 3.24) and 8-9 AM hour (Z-score of 2.26) shows notably elevated heart rate deviations during these morning hours, potentially reflecting anticipatory stress or a difficult transition into the day. The participant also reports being ""Happy"" with a high Z-score of 1.64, but the negative correlation with PSS suggests that this reported happiness may be superficial or mask underlying stress.

**Indicators Suggesting Relatively Low Perceived Stress:**

Conversely, several factors point towards a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score of -0.66, classified as ""Not depressed"") and low chronic anxiety proneness (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score of -0.82, classified as ""not anxious""). Self-esteem is within the healthy range (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 40.0, Z-Score of 0.26). Lifestyle behaviors also suggest lower stress, with no reported use of alcohol, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. While exercise frequency varies, the participant engages in exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.23), a behavior often associated with positive well-being. The Mesor (Value of 58.35, Z-score of -2.13) and Resting Heart Rate (Value of 45.6, Z-score of -1.49) are notably low, suggesting a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -0.9) is also lower, which might indicate more flexibility rather than rigidity in daily routines, potentially reducing stress.

**Holistic Interpretation and Comparison to Population Mean:**

Considering the combined evidence, the participant exhibits a complex profile. While indicators of disturbed sleep and elevated morning heart rate variability suggest potential stress, the absence of significant depressive symptoms or anxiety, coupled with healthy self-esteem and low resting physiological markers, leans towards a perceived stress level that is likely **near the population mean**. The positive self-reported happiness, despite a negative correlation with PSS, suggests a coping mechanism or a subjective experience that does not directly translate to high perceived stress on the PSS. The lower than average Mesor and Resting Heart Rate could indicate good physical conditioning, which may buffer against perceived stress. However, the high intradaily variability and pronounced morning heart rate deviations warrant attention as potential subtle indicators of stress not fully captured by self-report."
59673,"This participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be above the population mean, based on the collective indicators. Several self-reported measures and behavioral patterns suggest a higher subjective stress experience. The participant reports a PSQI score of 8.0, which, relative to the study population, is a Z-score of 0.59, indicating disturbed sleep. This aligns with a higher-than-average sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score of 0.98), suggesting inconsistency in sleep patterns, and a higher mean daily nap frequency (Z-score of 1.27), which can be a compensatory behavior for poor nighttime sleep or an indicator of daytime fatigue associated with stress. Furthermore, the participant's self-esteem score is notably high (Z-score of 1.66), which typically correlates with lower stress, however, other indicators point towards elevated stress. The participant also reports engaging in wine or liquor consumption 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.94), which is above the population average and can sometimes be a coping mechanism for stress.

Conversely, some data points suggest factors that might contribute to lower perceived stress or a neutral baseline. The participant reports being ""not depressed"" with a CES-D score of 7.0 (Z-score of -0.66) and ""not anxious"" with an STAI score of 37.0 (Z-score of -0.43), both of which are below the population mean and generally indicative of lower psychological distress. Health satisfaction is reported as relatively low (Z-score of -1.2), but this metric's correlation with PSS is weak (-0.08). Similarly, trust in others is above average (Z-score of 1.15), which is generally associated with greater well-being.

Regarding physiological data, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals several periods of elevated deviation from the mesor, particularly during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM: 13.74, 1-2 PM: 15.48, 5-6 PM: 16.06, 6-7 PM: 20.83) and also during late night hours (11-12 AM: 13.43). These elevated deviations during waking hours, especially in the afternoon and early evening, could reflect physiological responses to stressors or demands. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate good interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.09) but moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.17). The mesor (average heart rate) and amplitude are close to population means, suggesting that the overall rhythm structure is not severely disrupted, though the intradaily variability could point to some fluctuations. The acrophase at 5:58 PM is within a typical range.

In summary, while the participant reports low levels of depression and anxiety, indicators related to sleep quality, nap frequency, substance use, and physiological arousal patterns during key parts of the day suggest a higher perceived stress level. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean for this study sample."
74899,"This participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and physiological indicators, with several factors suggesting a potentially elevated level of perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate heightened anxiety proneness, as reflected by a high STAI-Trait score (52.0, Z-score 1.06), which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). Similarly, the participant reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CESD score 17.0, Z-score 0.38), with a positive correlation to perceived stress (0.28). These psychological states, coupled with a notably disturbed sleep pattern (PSQI score 9.0, Z-score 1.05), are commonly associated with increased perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports below-average happiness (Current happiness 3.0, Z-score -0.53), with a negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.19), and lower satisfaction with their health (Health Satisfaction score 6.0, Z-score 1.3), also negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.08), further supporting the inference of higher perceived stress.

In contrast, certain behavioral patterns and physiological metrics suggest potential resilience or lower perceived stress. The participant demonstrates a relatively high level of engagement in physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), and participating in sports (Z-score 0.91). While exercise frequency with others is moderate (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53), overall physical activity is a factor that can mitigate stress. The participant also reports relatively high trust of others (Trust score 4.17, Z-score 1.79), which is negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.05), implying a potentially supportive social environment. While sleep duration is notably short (Median Sleep Duration 5 hours 58 minutes, Z-score -1.52), indicating a significant area of concern for stress management, the standard deviations for sleep duration and start time are within the average range, suggesting some degree of regularity in sleep timing once initiated. The participant's academic performance, indicated by their GPA, is within a solid range, with recent GPA scores around 3.24 to 3.5.

Overall, the participant's data suggest a perceived stress level that is **above the population mean**. The elevated scores on anxiety and depressive symptom scales, coupled with significantly disturbed sleep quality and lower self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, strongly point towards a higher subjective experience of stress. While consistent engagement in physical activity and higher trust in others are positive indicators, they appear insufficient to fully offset the cumulative impact of the aforementioned negative correlates. The significant deviations in several early morning and late evening hours from the mesor in heart rate, particularly pronounced dips in the early morning (e.g., 5-6 AM: -20.17, Z-score -0.26; 7-8 AM: -21.29, Z-score -1.03), and elevated heart rate deviations in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 22.1, Z-score 1.69; 6-7 PM: 15.49, Z-score 0.52) suggest a disrupted physiological rhythm that may be indicative of stress, although the precise interpretation requires careful consideration of the context of the mesor and other circadian metrics. The low interdaily stability (Value 0.43, Z-score 0.17) in activity patterns also suggests a lack of consistent daily structure, which can contribute to perceived stress."
35011,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological and behavioral indicators that, when holistically considered, suggest a moderate level of perceived stress, likely around the population mean. Several self-reported survey metrics offer insight into this assessment. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 20.0, while not explicitly indicating depression in this dataset's classification, is above the 75th percentile for the study population and shows a positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that increased depressive symptoms may be associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait score is 36.0, which is below the population mean and classified as ""not anxious,"" correlating positively with PSS, indicating that lower chronic anxiety is associated with higher perceived stress, which is an inverse relationship worth noting. Self-esteem scores are relatively high (45.0), and while the correlation with PSS is negative, suggesting higher self-esteem is linked to lower stress, the absolute score is not significantly deviant from the mean. Subjective health satisfaction is low, as indicated by a Z-score of -1.78, and although the correlation with PSS is a weak negative, this measure could indicate underlying concerns that contribute to stress. Happiness levels are slightly above the population mean (Z-score of 0.55) with a negative correlation to PSS, suggesting that current happiness may partially buffer perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns reveal a mix of potentially stress-buffering and stress-exacerbating activities. Substance usage, particularly beer and wine/liquor, is at a higher frequency (1-2 times a week) than the population average, with positive Z-scores indicating above-average consumption. However, the correlations with PSS are negligible, suggesting limited direct impact on perceived stress levels from these specific habits. Exercise frequency, across all categories, is low, generally occurring 1-2 times a month, with mostly negative correlations to PSS, suggesting that insufficient physical activity might be a missed opportunity for stress reduction. Sedentary behaviors, such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, are higher than average, while more engaging activities like video games, reading, and socializing with friends are engaged in less frequently. The relatively high time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.64) and lower time spent socializing with friends (Z-score of -0.62) may contribute to a sense of isolation or passive coping, which can be associated with higher stress.

Physiological metrics derived from the wearable data also provide context. The participant exhibits significant deviations from typical circadian rhythms, evidenced by a very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -1.98) and high Intradaily Variability (Z-score of 1.37) in heart rate, suggesting a disrupted or irregular daily physiological pattern. The Mesor (average heart rate) is elevated (Z-score of 1.74), and the Amplitude is notably low (Z-score of -2.1), which could indicate a diminished capacity for physiological recovery and response to stressors. The resting heart rate is significantly elevated (Z-score of 2.31), suggesting a chronically heightened physiological arousal state. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 5 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -1.37), and a relatively late median sleep start time (02:34 AM), further contributing to potential sleep deprivation. The hourly deviation from the Mesor reveals pronounced positive deviations during late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM: 9.4, 1-2 PM: 7.72), potentially reflecting periods of increased physiological strain. Conversely, significant negative deviations occur during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -8.22, 4-5 AM: -7.12), indicating a period of physiological suppression that might be indicative of fragmented or non-restorative sleep.

Considering the combined self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While certain indicators like elevated resting heart rate, disrupted circadian rhythm, and shorter sleep duration suggest physiological strain that could contribute to higher perceived stress, these are counterbalanced by self-reported lower anxiety levels and relatively stable self-esteem. The moderate CES-D score and below-average health satisfaction do lean towards indicators of stress, but the lack of strong positive correlations with PSS across the board, and particularly the inverse relationship observed with the STAI, suggests a complex interplay of factors rather than an unequivocally high stress state."
89710,"The participant's self-reported data indicates several factors that may contribute to a higher perceived stress level. The participant reports a CES-D score of 39.0, classified as ""Depressed"" and with a z-score of 2.67, suggesting a significantly higher burden of depressive symptoms compared to the study population. Similarly, the STAI score of 55.0, classified as ""anxious"" with a z-score of 1.35, indicates a proneness to chronic anxiety that is above the population mean. The PSQI score of 10.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a z-score of 1.52, also points to significant subjective sleep difficulties. The participant's reported happiness level is also low, with a score of 2.0 and a z-score of -1.61, which is below the population mean and suggests lower self-reported happiness. In terms of daily habits, the participant spends a considerable amount of time on ""Video Games"" (1.71 standard deviations above the mean) and ""Internet Usage"" (2.19 standard deviations above the mean), and ""Listening to Music"" (2.06 standard deviations above the mean), which could be indicative of using these activities as coping mechanisms or distractions. Furthermore, the participant reports drinking wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, with a z-score of 0.94.

Conversely, several metrics suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level or indicate more positive psychological and behavioral characteristics. The participant's self-esteem score is 25.0 with a z-score of -1.85, indicating higher self-esteem than the population mean. Similarly, trust of others is relatively high, with a score of 2.33 and a z-score of -1.74, which is below the population mean for trust. Health satisfaction is also reported as low, with a score of 2.0 and a z-score of -1.7, though this could be a consequence of other underlying stressors rather than an independent indicator of low stress. The participant engages in exercise with others 1-2 times a week (z-score 0.53) and participates in sports 1-2 times a month (z-score 0.25), suggesting some level of physical activity. Sleep duration, while below the average of 8 hours, averages 6 hours and 44 minutes (z-score -0.56), which is not excessively low. The sleep start time variability is higher than average (z-score 1.09), suggesting a less regular sleep schedule, but the overall sleep duration variability is close to the mean.

Considering the aggregated hourly heart rate data and circadian rhythm metrics, the participant exhibits an average resting heart rate of 58.2 bpm (z-score 0.01), which is very close to the population mean. The mesor of the heart rate is 70.67 bpm (z-score -0.45), indicating a slightly lower average heart rate across the day than the population. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is 7.57 bpm (z-score -1.04), suggesting a somewhat reduced daily fluctuation in heart rate compared to the average. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is 0.22 (z-score -1.56), indicating a lower degree of regularity in daily heart rate patterns, which could be associated with disrupted daily routines. The mean aggregate deviations from the mesor reveal elevated heart rate during the evening hours (e.g., 5-6 PM shows a deviation of 20.32 with a z-score of 1.43, and 8-9 PM shows a deviation of 14.83 with a z-score of 0.91), which may reflect periods of increased physiological arousal. Conversely, there are notably lower deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM shows a deviation of -11.45 with a z-score of 0.77), suggesting periods of lower heart rate during sleep.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, appears to be **above the population mean**. This is primarily driven by significantly elevated scores in measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and anxiety proneness (STAI), as well as poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI). These psychological distress indicators, combined with a lower self-reported happiness level and considerable time spent on sedentary entertainment activities, strongly suggest a higher perceived stress burden. While some factors like higher self-esteem and trust could be protective, they are overshadowed by the pronounced presence of negative psychological symptoms and disturbed sleep. The irregular daily heart rate patterns (low interdaily stability) also align with a potentially less structured and more stressful lifestyle."
97596,"This participant presents with a complex profile, demonstrating certain indicators associated with heightened perceived stress alongside others that suggest a lower stress experience. Notably, the participant reports a high burden of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 33.0, which is 2.05 standard deviations above the study population mean. This is further complemented by a moderate level of chronic anxiety, with an STAI-Trait score of 47.0, falling 0.56 standard deviations above the mean. Subjectively, sleep quality appears to be significantly compromised, with a PSQI score of 15.0, placing the participant 3.83 standard deviations above the mean and indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance. In terms of daily habits, the participant dedicates a substantial amount of time to listening to music (more than 4 hours daily, Z-score 2.06) and reports engaging in reading for 16-30 minutes daily, with a negative correlation to PSS score, suggesting these activities may serve as a buffer. Socializing with friends also occupies a significant portion of their day (2-3 hours), indicating a potentially supportive social network. However, despite these potentially stress-mitigating factors, several physiological and behavioral metrics suggest underlying strain. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated at 63.6 bpm, which is 0.65 standard deviations above the population mean. Furthermore, the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates notable physiological arousal during specific periods, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening. The periods of 5-6 PM and 6-7 PM show the largest positive deviations from the mesor (16.29 and 17.13 respectively), coinciding with potential evening work or social demands. The intraday variability of heart rate is also high (Z-score 0.81), suggesting less stable diurnal physiological patterns.

Conversely, several indicators suggest a lower perceived stress level. The participant reports a relatively high self-esteem score of 36.0 (Z-score -0.31), indicating a positive self-perception. Happiness levels are also reported as relatively low (Current score 2.0, Z-score -1.61), which, in conjunction with high CESD and STAI, might suggest a more pronounced mood disturbance rather than solely stress. Notably, the participant engages in regular exercise, attending to ""Exercised Alone"" three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), which is generally associated with positive mental health outcomes. Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of beer or recreational drugs, and infrequent use of wine or liquor. The participant's academic performance, as reflected in their GPAs, is strong across multiple semesters, indicating successful functioning in a demanding academic environment. Sleep duration is also relatively long, with a median of 8 hours and 10 minutes (Z-score 1.22), although the subjective quality of this sleep is compromised according to the PSQI. The circadian rhythm appears to be generally stable, with an interdaily stability of 0.39, which is only slightly below the population mean.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the integrated data, appears to be **above the population mean**. The significant elevations in depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, and particularly the severely disturbed sleep quality, strongly suggest a higher perceived stress load. While positive factors such as self-esteem, exercise, and strong academic performance are present, they are not sufficient to fully counterbalance the impact of the negative psychological and sleep metrics. The physiological data, particularly the elevated resting heart rate and intraday variability, further support the notion of an increased physiological stress response. The significant negative correlation between Reading time and PSS score highlights a potential coping mechanism that could be further leveraged."
57359,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a profile characterized by relatively low levels of psychological distress and high self-regard. Notably, their scores on the CES-D (11.0, Z-score -0.24) and STAI-Trait (39.0, Z-score -0.23) indicate they are not experiencing significant depressive symptoms or chronic anxiety, falling below the population mean for both measures. This is further supported by a high Self-Esteem score (35.0, Z-score -0.45) and high self-reported happiness (3.0, Z-score -0.53), both of which are lower than average on their respective scales, suggesting a potentially more positive and confident disposition. Health satisfaction is also reported as being relatively good (3.78, Z-score -0.37). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA (ranging from 3.84 to 4.0), is exceptionally high, which may contribute to a sense of accomplishment and well-being. Regarding lifestyle, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for beer and wine/liquor), no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and infrequent solitary exercise (1-2 times a month), though they engage in sports 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits are generally moderate, with limited time spent watching TV/videos and playing video games, and more substantial internet usage (2-3 hours), though reading is not a reported habit. The participant's sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score 6.0, Z-Score -0.33), with a score above 5 commonly suggesting clinical significance.

Wearable-derived physiological and behavioral data present a more nuanced picture, with some indicators suggesting potential physiological strain that could be associated with stress. The participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (52.3, Z-score -0.7), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm metrics reveal a high degree of regularity in heart rate patterns, as evidenced by strong interdaily stability (0.43, Z-score 0.17) and a relatively low intradaily variability (0.51, Z-score -0.25). The Mesor (70.97, Z-score -0.41) is also lower than the population average. However, the detailed analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals significant patterns. Notably, there are pronounced positive deviations during waking hours, particularly between 8-9 AM (17.81, Z-score 2.26) and 7-8 PM (17.82, Z-score 1.1), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal during the day. Conversely, heart rate deviations are significantly negative during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: -12.22, Z-score -1.48; 3-4 AM: -22.17, Z-score -0.92; 5-6 AM: -23.01, Z-score -0.68), indicating a substantial dip in heart rate during presumed sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-score 1.18) and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Median 00:05:32, Standard Deviation 74 minutes), which might typically be associated with lower stress. However, the relatively high number of mean daily naps (0.18, Z-score 1.27) could be an indicator of insufficient restorative sleep or a response to daytime fatigue.

In consideration of the integrated data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While self-reported psychological measures suggest a low stress profile, the objective physiological data, particularly the elevated heart rate deviations during certain periods of the day and the clinically significant PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, point towards potential underlying stressors or challenges in maintaining optimal physiological regulation. The high academic achievement and positive self-reported psychological traits may serve as protective factors, mitigating the outward expression of stress. The discrepancy between subjective reports and objective physiological patterns warrants further attention to understand the full impact of the academic semester on the participant's well-being."
17308,"The analysis of the provided data suggests a participant experiencing a moderate level of perceived stress, likely near the population mean. This is supported by several factors, including a slightly elevated score on the STAI–Trait scale, indicating a propensity towards chronic anxiety. While the CES-D score falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification and has a weak positive correlation with PSS, the presence of general anxiety proneness warrants consideration. Furthermore, a notable finding is the participant's self-reported happiness score, which is above the population average, suggesting a potential buffering effect against higher stress levels. Health satisfaction, although slightly below average, does not appear to be a significant driver of perceived stress.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral patterns, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), which has minimal correlation with perceived stress. Exercise habits indicate a healthy engagement, with exercising alone occurring three or more times a week, which shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress, potentially suggesting that physical activity may be a coping mechanism rather than a stressor. Sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies and using the internet are relatively low, with internet usage being significantly below the population average. This suggests a potential preference for less passive engagement, which may or may not directly impact stress perception. The participant also reports not engaging in video games or reading, which could represent missed opportunities for stress-reducing activities.

Physiological data reveal a relatively low resting heart rate, suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates notable deviations from the mesor, particularly during late morning (10-11 AM) and afternoon/early evening (3-5 PM, 5-6 PM), where heart rate is significantly elevated above the mesor. Conversely, deep sleep hours (1-5 AM) show significant negative deviations, suggesting a period of reduced physiological activity during this time. The mesor itself is lower than the population average, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is within the population norm. While interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is below average, suggesting some irregularity, intradaily variability and 24-hour autocorrelation are near the population mean. Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration and a relatively stable sleep start time, with standard deviations below the population mean. The PSQI score suggests good overall sleep quality, contradicting the slightly reduced interdaily stability in heart rate.

Considering the interplay of these factors, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While some indicators like trait anxiety lean towards higher stress, this is counterbalanced by good sleep quality, above-average happiness, and a relatively low resting heart rate. The elevated heart rate deviations during waking hours, especially in the late morning and afternoon, may represent transient physiological responses to stressors rather than a chronic state of heightened arousal. The lower than average mesor and mesor deviation during sleep hours are indicative of effective physiological recovery. The overall profile suggests an individual who, while possessing some predispositions to anxiety, demonstrates adaptive coping mechanisms and physiological patterns that likely maintain their perceived stress levels in alignment with the study population."
51851,"This analysis examines the psychological and behavioral data of a participant in relation to their perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant's reported academic performance, indicated by GPAs of 3.63 (Fall 2015) and 3.79 (Spring 2016), suggests a relatively strong engagement with academic demands. Furthermore, low scores on the CES-D (14.0, Z=0.07) and STAI-Trait (35.0, Z=-0.62) scales, classifying the participant as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" respectively, along with a high score on self-esteem (46.0, Z=1.1), suggest a robust psychological foundation and a lower propensity for experiencing stress-related symptoms. These factors, particularly the low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, are generally associated with a lower perceived stress level. The participant also reports high overall health satisfaction (Score=6.44, Z=1.63), further supporting the inference of a lower perceived stress state. Additionally, a high degree of trust in others (Score=2.5, Z=-1.42) and moderate levels of happiness (Current=3.0, Z=-0.53) contribute to a profile less predisposed to elevated stress.

Conversely, certain behavioral and physiological metrics warrant consideration in the context of perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z=0.59) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a common correlate of higher perceived stress. While the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes (Z=-0.28) is close to the population mean, the sleep start time standard deviation of 111 minutes (Z=0.61) suggests variability in sleep onset, which can be disruptive. The wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal a relatively low interdaily stability (Value=0.32, Z=-0.74), implying a less structured daily routine, and a high intradaily variability (Value=0.72, Z=1.23), suggesting greater fluctuations in physiological activity throughout the day. Notably, the mesor (Value=60.05, Z=-1.9) and resting heart rate (Value=41.1, Z=-2.03) are substantially lower than the population average, which could indicate a lower baseline physiological arousal but may also, in conjunction with high intradaily variability, suggest a system that is more reactive to stressors. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor for heart rate shows elevated values during evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, 18.88, Z=1.11; 8-9 PM, 16.83, Z=1.27; 10-11 PM, 16.4, Z=1.57), potentially indicating heightened physiological activity in the latter part of the day, which can be associated with stress.

When considering the overall profile, the participant's strong academic performance, low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and positive health satisfaction appear to counteract indicators of potential stress such as disturbed sleep and high intradaily physiological variability. The positive correlations observed between the PSS score and metrics like CES-D, STAI, and intradaily variability suggest that elevations in these measures are associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, negative correlations between PSS and metrics like self-esteem and trust suggest that higher levels of these traits are associated with lower perceived stress. Given the available data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While specific indicators such as disturbed sleep and evening heart rate deviations suggest some challenges, the robust psychological traits and academic success provide a mitigating influence on overall perceived stress."
77872,"The participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean for the study sample. While several indicators point to potentially higher stress, these are counterbalanced by factors suggesting a more moderate stress experience. Specifically, the positive correlation between higher deviations from the mesor during late evening hours (e.g., 11 PM - 12 AM, with a Z-score of 1.85) and the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12 AM - 1 AM, Z-score of 1.63) suggests periods of elevated physiological arousal during times typically associated with rest. This is further supported by a relatively high mesor (Z-score of 0.65) and amplitude (Z-score of 0.75), indicating a generally higher average heart rate and greater variation around that average. The intraday variability of heart rate also presents a higher-than-average Z-score of 0.16, suggesting a less consistent daily heart rate pattern. Moreover, a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 50 minutes (Z-score of -0.44) is below the typical recommendation for optimal functioning, and the sleep start time standard deviation (Z-score of -0.02) suggests some variability, though not extreme.

Conversely, several self-report measures and behavioral patterns indicate a lower perceived stress level, or at least a resilience to stressors. The participant reports not being depressed (CES-D Z-score of -0.24) and not being chronically anxious (STAI Z-score of -0.82). Self-esteem is relatively high (Z-score of 0.82), and happiness is reported as near the average (Z-score of -0.53). Health satisfaction is also notably high (Z-score of 0.97). In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in moderate substance usage (Beer, 1-2 times a week, Z-score of 1.01, though with a negative correlation to PSS), and limits recreational drug use. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is in the moderate range (1-2 times a week), and the participant actively engages in reading for 16-30 minutes daily (Z-score of 1.3). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI Z-score of -0.8), and overall interdaily stability of their activity pattern is near the population mean (Z-score of -0.08). The participant's academic performance, as indicated by their GPA, is in the 2.97-3.2 range, which is moderate. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm occurring in the late afternoon (5:58 PM) aligns with typical human physiology.

In summary, the participant's physiological data suggest a tendency towards elevated cardiovascular activity and some disruption in sleep regularity, which could be associated with stress. However, their self-reported psychological well-being, particularly regarding anxiety and depression, along with positive lifestyle choices like reading and good subjective sleep quality, appear to mitigate the overall perceived stress. Considering the confluence of these factors, the participant's perceived stress level is assessed as being near the population mean."
72348,"The participant's self-reported data and wearable-derived metrics suggest a profile that may be associated with a PSS score near the population mean, with some indicators leaning towards slightly higher perceived stress. A notable indicator is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, which is above the general population threshold for disturbed sleep and has a positive Z-score of 0.59, suggesting poorer subjective sleep quality compared to the study sample. This aligns with a weak positive correlation (0.28) observed between CES-D scores and PSS, though the participant's CES-D score of 6.0 is classified as ""Not depressed."" Furthermore, the participant's higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score of 1.55) and a significantly elevated Mesor (Z-score of 1.69) suggest a generally higher physiological arousal baseline. The wearable data also indicates marked deviations from the Mesor during morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM: Z=1.50, 9-10 AM: Z=1.71), potentially reflecting increased physiological activation during typical wakeful periods, which could be perceived as stressful. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 2.49) is particularly high, indicating a strong diurnal rhythmicity, which, when coupled with other indicators, might reflect a rigid or heightened internal clock.

Conversely, several metrics suggest factors that might contribute to lower perceived stress. The participant reports high happiness (current score of 3.0, though with a negative Z-score of -0.53 relative to the sample mean) and has a relatively high self-esteem score (34.0, with a negative Z-score of -0.59). Their GPA scores (ranging from 3.6 to 3.93) indicate academic success, which can buffer against stress. Moreover, the participant reports no substance usage and limited engagement in vigorous physical activities such as sports or exercising with others, which could reduce exposure to certain stressors. Their sleep duration is notably long (median duration of 8 hours 22 minutes, Z-score of 1.48), and the variability in sleep duration and start time is relatively low (Z-scores of -1.40 and -1.24, respectively), suggesting a stable sleep schedule, despite the overall poorer subjective sleep quality indicated by the PSQI. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate is also relatively low (Z-score of -0.81), suggesting less chaotic physiological fluctuations throughout the day.

Overall, the participant's PSS score is inferred to be near the population mean. The data presents a complex picture, where higher physiological arousal and subjective reports of disturbed sleep are juxtaposed with positive self-regard, academic achievement, and stable sleep patterns. While the heightened physiological activity and poor sleep quality might suggest a tendency towards elevated stress, the robust self-esteem and happiness levels could act as mitigating factors. The participant's perceived stress level is likely near the population mean, with the indicators for higher stress (physiological arousal, disturbed sleep quality) being balanced by indicators for lower stress (self-esteem, happiness, stable sleep schedule)."
89607,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a psychological profile that may be associated with elevated perceived stress. The CES-D score of 24.0 (Z-score of 1.11) falls into the ""Depressed"" classification, indicating a higher burden of depressive symptoms compared to the study population. Similarly, the STAI trait anxiety score of 49.0 (Z-score of 0.76) classifies the participant as ""anxious,"" suggesting a tendency towards experiencing chronic anxiety. These elevated scores in depression and anxiety are positively correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, aligning with the expectation that higher levels of these symptoms would contribute to greater perceived stress. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 7.0, indicating ""Disturbed Sleep,"" also correlates with the PSS, suggesting that subjective sleep quality is a factor in perceived stress. The participant's academic performance, as indicated by their GPA, shows a decline from 3.2 in Fall 2015 to 2.6 in Spring 2016 and then a slight recovery to 2.7 in Fall 2016, which could reflect periods of heightened stress during the academic semester.

In contrast, several self-reported lifestyle and attitudinal measures suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports high levels of engagement in social activities, with ""Socializing with Friends"" occurring for 1-2 hours daily. They also report frequent engagement in ""Exercised Alone"" (three times a week or more), ""Exercised with Others"" (three times a week or more), and ""Sports"" (three times a week or more). These positive lifestyle habits are generally associated with better mental well-being. While the correlation with PSS is relatively weak for these specific activities, consistent engagement in exercise and social interaction can serve as protective factors against stress. Additionally, the participant reports high self-esteem (Score of 40.0, which is the maximum score on the RSES), indicating a strong sense of self-worth, which typically acts as a buffer against perceived stress. Similarly, high ""Health Satisfaction"" (Score of 4.0) and a generally positive outlook on ""Trust"" (Score of 3.0) may contribute to a more resilient psychological state.

Analysis of wearable data reveals a complex physiological and behavioral rhythm. The ""Interdaily Stability"" of heart rate (Value of 0.56, Z-score of 1.24) is notably higher than the population mean, suggesting a highly regular daily pattern of physiological activity. This regularity, while potentially indicative of structure, does not appear strongly correlated with the PSS score in this dataset. The ""Resting Heart Rate"" is also elevated at 68.6 (Z-score of 1.24), which is above the population mean. Higher resting heart rate can be associated with physiological arousal and, in some contexts, higher stress levels. The pattern of ""Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor"" shows pronounced negative deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am: -8.81, 4-5 am: -11.79, 5-6 am: -12.84), indicating periods of significantly lower-than-average heart rate during typical sleep times. Conversely, there are substantial positive deviations during the afternoon, particularly between 1-2 pm (16.96) and 2-3 pm (13.1), suggesting increased physiological arousal during these periods. The ""Median Sleep Duration"" is notably long at 8 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score of 1.26), which is above the population mean. However, the positive correlation of this metric with PSS is weak, suggesting that while sleep duration is ample, it may not be effectively mitigating stress.

Based on a holistic interpretation of the available data, the participant exhibits several indicators strongly suggesting a relatively high perceived stress level, exceeding the population mean. The elevated scores in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), are significant self-reported markers that positively correlate with PSS. While positive lifestyle factors such as frequent exercise, social interaction, and high self-esteem are present, they do not appear to fully counteract the impact of the psychological symptoms and sleep disturbances on perceived stress. The elevated resting heart rate further supports a state of physiological arousal that can be associated with stress. Therefore, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean of 21.62."
59900,"The participant’s psychological and behavioral profile suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing their perceived stress, which appears to be near the population mean for perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological state, with low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 13.0, Z-score -0.03), low chronic anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score -0.43), and a healthy level of self-esteem (Self-Esteem score of 39.0, Z-Score 0.11). Furthermore, the participant reports high trust in others (Trust score of 3.67, Z-Score 0.83) and a moderate level of happiness (Current Happy score of 4.0, Z-Score 0.55). Despite these positive indicators, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality, as evidenced by a high PSQI score of 14.0 (Z-Score 3.37), which is substantially above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This finding is a significant factor that may contribute to heightened perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times per week, aligning with population norms for these substances (Beer Z-Score 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-Score 0.94). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as not at all. Physical activity levels are notably low, with no reported frequency of exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, indicated by substantially negative Z-scores for these metrics (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively). Daily recreational habits are varied, with moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-Score 0.01), and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-Score 0.16). Other sedentary habits, such as video games, internet usage, listening to music, and reading, are engaged in for shorter durations or not at all, with most Z-scores being negative. These behaviors, particularly the lack of physical activity, may indirectly influence perceived stress levels.

Wearable data reveals a circadian rhythm characterized by relatively stable mesor (71.11, Z-Score -0.39) and amplitude (8.27, Z-Score -0.81), suggesting a generally regulated cardiovascular system. However, the circadian rhythm exhibits reduced regularity and structure compared to the population, as indicated by low Interdaily Stability (0.32, Z-Score -0.74) and Intradaily Variability (0.38, Z-Score -1.16). The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above the population mean (59.1, Z-Score 0.11). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of lower-than-average heart rate during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM Z-score 0.48, 3-4 AM Z-score 0.76, 4-5 AM Z-score 0.92, 5-6 AM Z-score 0.81), potentially reflecting sleep patterns. Conversely, higher heart rate deviations are observed during midday and early evening hours, particularly between 1 PM and 2 PM (Z-score 0.25) and 4 PM and 5 PM (Z-score 0.20). Sleep statistics indicate a prolonged median sleep duration (9 hours 22 minutes, Z-Score 2.71) and a relatively consistent sleep start time (Median 00:10:24, SD 137 minutes), which are generally favorable. However, the significant disturbance reported in subjective sleep quality (PSQI score) appears to be a primary driver of perceived stress, potentially overriding the benefits of longer sleep duration.

In summation, while the participant presents with strong psychological resilience and positive social connections, significant sleep disturbance and a lack of physical activity are notable indicators that likely contribute to their overall perceived stress. The participant's perceived stress level is inferred to be near the population mean for the study sample."
28254,"This participant exhibits a complex profile with indicators suggesting both potential elevated and reduced perceived stress. On the one hand, several self-report measures point towards psychological well-being and lower trait anxiety. Specifically, the participant reports low depressive symptoms (CESD score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.76) and very low trait anxiety (STAI score of 32.0, Z-score of -0.92), both of which are notably below the population means and generally associated with lower perceived stress. Similarly, self-esteem is within the typical range (SelfEsteem score of 40.0, Z-Score of 0.26), and self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy current score of 3.0, Z-Score of -0.53), though the correlation with perceived stress is negative, suggesting higher happiness might be associated with lower stress. Furthermore, the participant engages in moderate social drinking (Beer 1-2 times a week, Z-Score 1.01; Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-Score 0.94), which, while potentially a coping mechanism, is not a direct indicator of high stress in itself.

Conversely, several physiological and sleep-related metrics, alongside specific behavioral patterns, may suggest underlying contributors to perceived stress. The participant's sleep quality appears to be disturbed (PSQI score of 7.0, Z-Score of 0.13), exceeding the common threshold for significant sleep disturbance. This is further supported by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 45 minutes (Z-Score of -0.53), which is below average, and a notable variability in sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation of 122 minutes, Z-Score of 0.86). The wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics also indicate a lack of regularity; interdaily stability is low (Value of 0.28, Z-Score of -1.07), and intradaily variability is also relatively low (Value of 0.46, Z-Score of -0.6), suggesting a less structured daily physiological rhythm. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is also lower than average (Value of 8.37, Z-Score of -0.78), which can sometimes be associated with stress or fatigue. Furthermore, the participant reports moderate engagement in sedentary behaviors, such as watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-Score of 0.01) and video games (15 minutes or less, Z-Score of 0.2), while also reporting lower than average time spent socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score of -0.62), potentially indicating reduced social support or engagement. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of significant deviation from the mesor, particularly elevated deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM: 1.81 Z-score, 5-6 AM: 1.36 Z-score, 6-7 AM: 0.84 Z-score) and afternoon hours (e.g., 1-2 PM: 0.75 Z-score, 2-3 PM: 1.0 Z-score, 3-4 PM: 0.75 Z-score), which, relative to their resting heart rate, could suggest periods of physiological activation.

Considering the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While strong indicators of low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms suggest a foundation of psychological resilience, the presence of disturbed sleep, disrupted circadian rhythm regularity, and patterns of physiological arousal during specific times of day, alongside lower social engagement, point towards potential stressors impacting well-being. The average academic performance (GPAs ranging from 3.18 to 3.48) is also indicative of moderate academic pressure. The interplay between low self-reported negative affect and potentially disruptive physiological and behavioral patterns warrants further exploration to understand the subjective experience of stress in this individual."
35347,"The participant exhibits a relatively low perceived stress level, falling below the population mean PSS score of 21.61. This conclusion is supported by several key indicators across self-reported surveys and wearable-derived metrics. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 10.0, Z-score -0.34) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02). Furthermore, a notable Z-score of -2.07 for trust suggests a significantly lower-than-average trust of other people, which, while not directly indicative of stress, may point to a more cautious interpersonal disposition. Self-esteem is reported at a moderate level (Score 45.0, Z-Score 0.96).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a substantial amount of internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.19) and significant recreational reading (more than 4 hours, Z-score 6.21), with the latter showing a moderate negative correlation with PSS. Socializing with friends is also high (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74). In contrast, physical activity is notably low, with exercising alone, exercising with others, and sports all reported at ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" or ""Not at all"" frequencies, indicated by negative Z-scores. Sleep duration is notably high, with a median of 8 hours and 29 minutes (Z-score 1.61), contrasting with a PSQI score of 6.0, which suggests disturbed sleep quality, despite the longer duration. The sleep start time is highly variable, with a median of 02:12:00 and a standard deviation of 56 minutes (Z-score -0.6), indicating a less regulated sleep schedule.

Physiologically, the participant's circadian rhythm, as inferred from heart rate data, shows some regularity. The interdaily stability of 0.45 (Z-score 0.33) and intradaily variability of 0.55 (Z-score 0.03) suggest a moderately consistent daily pattern. The acrophase at 6:18 PM indicates the peak of their circadian rhythm, and the mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.43) compared to the population. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals a pattern of increased heart rate in the late evening and early morning hours, with notable peaks between 6-7 PM and 12-1 AM, which may correlate with late-night activity or sleep onset. The relatively low resting heart rate of 57.8 bpm (Z-score -0.04) suggests good cardiovascular fitness.

In summary, the participant reports low levels of psychological distress and engages in high levels of passive leisure activities such as internet use and reading, while showing minimal engagement in physical exercise. Despite a generally positive psychological profile and longer sleep duration, the PSQI score indicates subjective sleep disturbance and a highly variable sleep start time. These factors, in conjunction with the participant's overall low PSS score, suggest a predominantly low perceived stress state, though the disturbed sleep quality and low interpersonal trust warrant consideration. The participant’s overall perceived stress level is below the population mean."
45641,"The participant exhibits a psychological profile suggestive of elevated perceived stress, with several indicators aligning with higher Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate burden of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CES-D score of 22.0, which is above the 75th percentile of the study population's PSS scores and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress. Similarly, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is at 46.0, placing it above the population mean PSS score and correlating positively with perceived stress, suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety. While self-esteem is relatively lower than the population mean PSS score at -0.87 Z-score, its weak negative correlation with PSS suggests it may not be a primary driver of perceived stress in this context. Subjective sleep quality, measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (score of 7.0), with a positive correlation to PSS, indicating that poorer sleep quality may contribute to higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant demonstrates a lower than average satisfaction with their health (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -1.45), which correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting that poorer health satisfaction is not directly linked to higher perceived stress. In terms of behavioral habits, there is a notable tendency towards sedentary activities, with high reported durations for ""Sedentary Hobby"" (Z-score of 2.01) and ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (Z-score of 0.64), and a significant reduction in ""Socializing with Friends"" (Z-score of -1.41). These sedentary habits show a weak association with perceived stress, with only ""Internet Usage"" exhibiting a minor positive correlation.

Conversely, several factors suggest a lower perceived stress profile or do not strongly indicate elevated stress. The participant reports minimal substance usage, with ""Beer,"" ""Wine or Liquor,"" ""Recreational Drugs,"" and ""Non-prescribed Drugs"" all indicating low to no usage, and these have negligible correlations with PSS. Similarly, exercise habits, including ""Exercised Alone,"" ""Exercised with Others,"" and ""Sports,"" are reported at low frequencies, with ""Sports"" having a weak negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that engagement in sports is associated with lower perceived stress. The participant's happiness levels, while below the population mean PSS score at -0.53 Z-score, exhibit a negative correlation with PSS, indicating that higher happiness is associated with lower perceived stress. Wearable data reveals relatively stable circadian rhythm metrics, with an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 1.41 suggesting high regularity in daily patterns, and an Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.53 indicating low within-day fluctuations. While the MESOR and Amplitude of heart rate are elevated compared to the population mean PSS score, their correlations with PSS are weak. The participant demonstrates largely regular sleep patterns, with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score of 0.89) and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of -0.02), and a low standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score of -0.73), all of which have weak negative correlations with PSS. The absence of naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score of -0.86) also suggests a potentially more structured sleep schedule.

Holistically, the participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely **above the population mean**. The combination of elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and disturbed subjective sleep quality, all of which show positive correlations with perceived stress, strongly points towards a higher stress experience. While some factors such as low social interaction and sedentary habits could be indicative of stress, their direct correlations with PSS are weak. Conversely, the stable circadian rhythms and consistent sleep duration patterns, which typically are associated with lower stress, do not appear to counterbalance the significant psychological indicators of heightened stress. The positive correlations observed for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are particularly salient in this assessment."
64572,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a complex interplay of factors influencing their perceived stress. On measures related to mental well-being, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.97) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 35.0, Z-score of -0.62), both indicating a relatively lower burden compared to the study population. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53), and trust in others is above average (Z-score of 0.83). Health satisfaction is also slightly below the population mean (Z-score of -0.45). Regarding lifestyle, the participant reports no substance usage and engages in moderate exercise, particularly sports (Z-score of 0.91). Daily recreational habits include a moderate amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with less time dedicated to reading and sedentary hobbies compared to the average. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is indicated as disturbed (score of 6.0, Z-score of -0.33), with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -0.69). The median sleep start time is approximately 12:43 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start times.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data reveals several notable patterns. The participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm as indicated by a high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.66), suggesting good regularity in daily patterns. However, intradaily variability is near the population average (Z-score of -0.11), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly higher than average (Z-score of 0.39), suggesting a degree of routine. The mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is below population average (Z-score of -0.92), and the resting heart rate is also notably low (Z-score of -0.93). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.49). Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal elevated heart rate activity in the late evening and night, particularly between 7 PM and 10 PM, with peak deviations occurring between 8 PM and 9 PM (Z-score of 2.47) and 9 PM and 10 PM (Z-score of 1.81). Conversely, heart rate during the early morning hours (2 AM to 6 AM) shows significant deviations below the mesor, suggesting a period of low physiological arousal during sleep.

Considering the aggregated data, the participant demonstrates characteristics that could be associated with both lower and higher perceived stress. Low levels of reported depression and anxiety, along with above-average trust and sports engagement, might suggest a lower baseline stress level. However, the reported disturbed sleep quality, below-average sleep duration, and a tendency for elevated heart rate during evening hours could indicate physiological responses potentially linked to higher stress. The significant deviations from the mesor in the evening hours warrant further attention, as they may reflect arousal or difficulty winding down. The participant’s overall perceived stress level, inferred from the totality of these metrics, appears to be **near the population mean**. While some indicators point towards lower stress (e.g., low depression/anxiety), others, particularly sleep and evening heart rate patterns, suggest that perceived stress may be closer to the average for this study sample."
28312,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, hovering near the population mean. While some indicators point towards elevated stress, others suggest resilience and effective coping mechanisms. The participant reports experiencing anxiety, as indicated by a STAI Trait score of 48.0, which falls within the ""anxious"" classification and is above the population mean. This subjective experience of chronic anxiety correlates positively with perceived stress. Furthermore, a PSQI score of 9.0 indicates disturbed sleep quality, which is a significant factor often associated with heightened stress. The high Z-score (1.05) for the PSQI further emphasizes this deviation from the norm within the study population.

Conversely, several factors suggest a lower stress burden. The participant's self-esteem score of 35.0 is relatively high, indicating strong self-worth, and this correlates negatively with perceived stress. Similarly, higher self-reported happiness (Current score of 4.0 with a positive Z-score) and trust (Score of 3.0 with a near-zero Z-score) also show negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting a degree of psychological well-being. In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports moderate consumption of beer and wine/liquor, and no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels, particularly exercising alone and sports participation, are infrequent. Daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with less time dedicated to reading.

Physiological data reveals a notable pattern of higher cardiovascular arousal during specific daytime hours. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant positive deviations from the mesor during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: +21.85, 4-5 PM: +14.29, 3-4 PM: +14.84). This pattern, particularly the elevated heart rate in the late afternoon and evening, could reflect increased physiological stress or activity during these times. The mesor itself is elevated (Z-score of 1.3), indicating a generally higher baseline heart rate compared to the population. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also high (Z-score of 1.54), suggesting greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 35 minutes, which is slightly above average, but the median sleep start time is late (1:23 AM), with a relatively low standard deviation for sleep start time, suggesting a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is moderate (Z-score of 0.33), implying some regularity in daily patterns.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While the subjective reports of anxiety and disturbed sleep, coupled with elevated physiological arousal during certain hours, suggest potential stressors, these are counterbalanced by strong self-esteem, higher happiness, and consistent sleep timing. The correlation coefficients, while informative, do not strongly suggest a significantly elevated or diminished PSS score, reinforcing the conclusion of a central tendency."
56805,"The participant presents with a complex profile that, when analyzed holistically, suggests a perceived stress level that is **near the population mean**. While several indicators point towards elevated stress, these are counterbalanced by factors indicative of resilience and effective self-management.

Several self-reported measures indicate a tendency towards lower perceived stress. The participant reports very low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 1.0, Z-score of -1.28), indicating no significant depressive burden. Similarly, trait anxiety is low, with a STAI score of 20.0 (Z-score of -2.11), suggesting a general proneness to be unanxious. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 50.0 (Z-score of 1.66), which can serve as a protective factor against stress. Health satisfaction is also high (score of 7.0, Z-score of 2.05), aligning with a positive perception of well-being. Furthermore, the participant reports no substance usage and engages in regular physical activity, particularly exercising with others (three times a week or more, Z-score of 1.23) and participating in sports (three times a week or more, Z-score of 1.58), behaviors often associated with stress reduction. Notably, internet usage is low (15 minutes or less, Z-score of -1.83), which may indicate a reduced exposure to potentially stressful online content.

Conversely, certain physiological and sleep-related metrics suggest areas where perceived stress may be elevated or contributing to suboptimal functioning. The median sleep duration is significantly low at 5 hours and 33 minutes (Z-score of -2.02), accompanied by a relatively high standard deviation in sleep duration (75 minutes, Z-score of -0.59), suggesting inconsistency in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is also very late at 01:19:59 (standard deviation of 54 minutes, Z-score of -0.63). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals low interdaily stability (0.3, Z-score of -0.9), indicating less regularity in daily activity patterns. The MESOR of heart rate (64.45, Z-score of -1.3) is also relatively low. In terms of daily heart rate variation, there is a notable pattern of significant deviations below the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM with a Z-score of -1.92, and 4-5 AM with a Z-score of -2.08), which could reflect prolonged periods of low physiological arousal during crucial sleep/rest times. Positive correlations between elevated PSS and these early morning negative heart rate deviations are observed, suggesting that when these periods of low arousal are more pronounced, perceived stress may be higher. Conversely, several periods of elevated heart rate relative to the mesor are observed during typical waking hours (e.g., 8-9 AM with a Z-score of 1.94, 10-11 AM with a Z-score of 1.93, and 3-4 PM with a Z-score of 1.0), which, without additional context, could indicate physiological activation.

In summation, the participant exhibits strong protective psychological traits, high self-esteem, and healthy lifestyle habits, including regular exercise and absence of substance use. However, these positive attributes are juxtaposed with significantly compromised sleep duration and a less stable circadian rhythm, along with specific patterns of heart rate deviation during the early morning hours that correlate with increased perceived stress. Given this interplay of factors, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean for the study sample."
26800,"The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be below the population mean. This inference is supported by several indicators. The participant's score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) itself is not directly provided, but can be estimated as being relatively low given the context of other measures. For instance, their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is 5.0, with a Z-score of -0.8, indicating good subjective sleep quality, which is typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, their CES-D score of 7.0 (Z-score -0.66) suggests a low level of depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score of 40.0 (Z-score -0.13) indicates relatively low chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is reported as high (Score: 45.0, Z-Score: 0.96). Happiness is reported at a moderate level (Current: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53), leaning towards lower rather than higher happiness, yet this is not strongly correlated with PSS. Health satisfaction is also reported as good (Score: 4.0, Z-score: -0.2).

Several behavioral patterns also align with lower perceived stress. The participant reports exercising alone less than 1-2 times a month (Z-Score: -1.18) and not at all with others (Z-Score: -1.58), but participates in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 0.91). Daily recreation habits show moderate engagement with internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.18) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.16), while significantly avoiding activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score: -1.25), listening to music (Z-Score: -1.19), and reading (Z-Score: -0.67). The participant also engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 0.94), but reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data contribute to this assessment of lower perceived stress, albeit with some nuances. The participant's resting heart rate is notably low (Value: 49.4, Z-Score: -1.04), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular health and potentially lower physiological stress response. The MESOR (mean heart rate) is also relatively low (Value: 67.3, Z-Score: -0.91). Sleep duration is near the population mean (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 14 minutes, Z-Score: 0.06), with a relatively stable sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation: 89 minutes, Z-Score: 0.13). The circadian rhythm metrics suggest moderate regularity (Interdaily Stability: 0.3, Z-Score: -0.9), with average variability (Intradaily Variability: 0.47, Z-Score: -0.53). The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is observed at 4:08 PM.

The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor present some interesting patterns. There are significant positive deviations during the late morning hours (9-10 AM: Z-Score 2.2, 10-11 AM: Z-Score 1.43), suggesting a period of higher physiological arousal during this time, which may or may not be directly linked to stress. Conversely, very low heart rate deviations are observed in the early morning hours (4-5 AM: Z-Score -0.61, 5-6 AM: Z-Score -0.42), consistent with deep sleep. The most pronounced negative deviations occur during the deep sleep phases, which is a normal physiological response.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **below the population mean**. This conclusion is drawn from the combination of low self-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep quality, and physiological metrics such as a low resting heart rate. While there are periods of elevated heart rate during the late morning, these do not appear to outweigh the broader indicators of lower perceived stress."
47142,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of behavioral and physiological indicators that suggest a moderate perceived stress level, likely near the population mean for the study sample.

Several factors point towards a potentially elevated PSS score. The participant's Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 19.0, with a Z-score of 0.59, indicates a notable burden of depressive symptoms. While not reaching a ""depressed"" classification threshold based solely on this score relative to the population, its positive correlation (0.28) with PSS suggests that experiencing more depressive symptoms is associated with higher perceived stress. Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait score of 43.0 (Z-score 0.17) falls within a range that could contribute to heightened stress, with a positive correlation of 0.31 further reinforcing the link between chronic anxiety proneness and perceived stress. Physiologically, the Mesor of heart rate (83.59, Z-score 1.32) is significantly elevated above the population mean, suggesting a generally higher baseline level of cardiovascular activity that may reflect a sustained state of arousal, a common correlate of stress. Furthermore, the observed Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.5, Z-score 1.48) is notably high, indicating a strong regularity in daily heart rate patterns, which, in conjunction with other metrics, could signal a rigidly structured physiological response possibly influenced by stress. The higher-than-average mean daily naps (Z-score 2.66) may also reflect attempts to compensate for sleep deficits or manage fatigue, which can be stress-related.

Conversely, certain indicators suggest factors that may mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), which is well below the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is further supported by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score -0.81), which, while not exceptionally long, falls within a reasonable range, and the sleep start time shows moderate stability (standard deviation of 69 minutes, Z-score -0.31). Self-reported happiness is relatively low (Z-score -0.53) with a negative correlation to PSS (-0.19), suggesting that lower happiness is not strongly associated with increased perceived stress in this instance, and the self-esteem score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.45) is near the population average, indicating no significant deficiency in self-worth that would typically exacerbate stress. The participant also reports no substance usage, and limited engagement in social activities (16-30 minutes/day with friends, Z-score -1.41), which could reduce exposure to certain stressors. Notably, Intradaily Variability in heart rate is low (0.36, Z-score -1.31), suggesting a more stable, less fragmented pattern of physiological activity throughout the day, which can be indicative of lower stress reactivity.

Considering the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While elevated indicators of depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, and physiological arousal (Mesor) suggest potential for higher stress, the good subjective sleep quality, moderate sleep duration, and low intradaily heart rate variability present counterbalancing factors. The combination of these elements suggests a perceived stress level that is not markedly divergent from the average within the study sample."
60396,"**Multimodal Analysis of Perceived Stress**

This analysis integrates self-report survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics to interpret the participant's perceived stress level. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a key outcome, and its score is contextualized against the study population's mean PSS of 21.62.

**Indicators of Relatively Higher Perceived Stress:**

Several indicators suggest a potentially elevated level of perceived stress for this participant. The participant exhibits a STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) Trait score of 42.0, classifying them as ""anxious."" While the Z-score for this measure is only slightly above the population mean (0.07), it indicates a propensity towards chronic anxiety. This aligns with a positive correlation (0.31) between STAI scores and PSS, suggesting that individuals with higher trait anxiety tend to report higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant's PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) score of 6.0, indicating ""Disturbed Sleep,"" is above the commonly cited threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Poor sleep quality is a well-established correlate of increased stress, and the PSQI score being relatively close to the population mean (Z-score of -0.33) suggests this may be a consistent issue. The wearable data reveals a significant intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score of -1.45), which, when contrasted with a relatively stable autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.57), could suggest a disrupted internal rhythm that may be exacerbated by stress. Moreover, the participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumption occurring 1-2 times per week (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), which can be both a coping mechanism for stress and a contributor to physiological dysregulation.

**Indicators of Relatively Lower Perceived Stress:**

Conversely, certain data points suggest potential resilience or lower perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively high level of trust (Trust score of 3.83, Z-score of 1.15), which has been weakly negatively correlated with PSS (-0.04), potentially indicating a supportive social environment that buffers stress. Self-esteem is also relatively high (SelfEsteem score of 33.0, Z-score of -0.73), and this measure shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.15), suggesting that higher self-worth may mitigate perceived stress. The participant's reported happiness level (Current Happy score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55) is above the population mean. Furthermore, the participant engages in regular exercise, particularly with others (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more', Z-score of 1.23), and while the correlation with PSS is negligible (-0.02), social exercise can be a positive coping strategy. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 23 minutes is within a healthy range, and the sleep duration standard deviation is relatively low (Z-score of -0.69), suggesting consistent sleep patterns. The mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is below the population mean (Z-score of -1.11), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm (variation around the mesor) is also slightly below average (Z-score of -0.2). This might indicate a less pronounced physiological response to daily fluctuations.

**Holistic Interpretation and Comparison to Population Mean:**

Considering the balance of these indicators, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While the presence of trait anxiety (STAI) and disturbed sleep (PSQI) are notable, they are offset by positive indicators such as high trust, high self-esteem, and consistent sleep duration. The moderate substance use is a potential area for concern, but its correlation with PSS is weak. The physiological data, particularly the mesor and amplitude, do not suggest extreme deviations indicative of high stress. The PSS score itself, if available and analyzed holistically, would provide the most direct confirmation, but based on the provided correlational data and individual metric interpretations, a position near the population average is most likely."
92412,"The participant's self-reported measures suggest a generally low perceived stress level. The CES-D score of 3.0 (Z-score: -1.07) indicates a low frequency of depressive symptoms, falling below the population mean for depressive symptomatology. Similarly, the STAI trait anxiety score of 32.0 (Z-score: -0.92) suggests a low level of chronic anxiety, also below the population average. The participant reports high self-esteem with a score of 44.0 (Z-score: 0.82), which is above the population mean for self-esteem, and high current happiness (Z-score: 1.64), indicating a positive psychological disposition. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score: -1.26) classifies their sleep quality as ""Good Sleep,"" suggesting minimal subjective sleep difficulties. Trust in others is reported at a moderate level (Z-score: -0.46), and health satisfaction is above average (Z-score: 0.63).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of exercise, participating in solo and group exercise three times a week or more, and sports 1-2 times a week, with a tendency towards engaging in physical activity with others (Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23). Their substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of alcohol (beer or wine/liquor) or recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits include moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage (both with Z-scores near 0), and limited time spent listening to music, socializing with friends, and engaging in sedentary hobbies or reading, with the latter two being particularly infrequent.

Physiological data from the wearable devices provide further insights into the participant's stress profile. The participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (Value: 53.0, Z-score: -0.61). The mesor, a measure of average heart rate, is also below the population mean (Value: 67.41, Z-score: -0.89), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is above average (Value: 13.08, Z-score: 0.74). The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (6:03 PM). Interdaily stability of heart rate is near the population mean (Value: 0.43, Z-score: 0.17), suggesting a moderate degree of regularity in daily activity patterns. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Value: 0.66, Z-score: 0.81), which could indicate some degree of physiological reactivity throughout the day. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals several periods of significant deviation. Notably, there is a pronounced positive deviation in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM: 39.22, Z-score: 4.19; 6-7 PM: 25.03, Z-score: 2.17), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal during this time. Conversely, the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -18.81, Z-score: -0.87; 3-4 AM: -20.46, Z-score: -0.65) show significant negative deviations, indicating periods of lower than average heart rate, consistent with sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (7 hours 48 minutes, Z-score: 0.76) and a highly regular sleep start time (median 00:54:15, standard deviation 49 minutes, Z-score: -0.74), suggesting good sleep hygiene. The lack of reported daily naps (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86) also supports consistent sleep patterns.

Overall, the participant's psychological and behavioral data strongly suggest a low perceived stress level. Their low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, indicate a positive mental state. The excellent sleep quality and duration further support this. While there are periods of elevated heart rate deviation in the late afternoon/early evening, this appears to be within a range that does not strongly correlate with higher perceived stress in this individual, and may reflect normal daily activity. The consistent sleep patterns and low resting heart rate contribute to an overall picture of physiological well-being. Considering the population mean PSS score of 21.63 and the strong indicators of low stress across multiple domains, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **below the population mean**."
92038,"**Multimodal Analysis of Perceived Stress**

This analysis integrates self-reported survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to assess perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant's PSS score, while not explicitly provided, can be inferred to be within the average range of the study population. The population mean PSS score is 21.62, with a standard deviation of 3.68, indicating that scores between approximately 17.94 and 25.30 are considered typical.

Several self-reported factors suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level. The participant reports a low frequency of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z-score -1.18) and low chronic anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02), both of which are associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 50.0, Z-Score 1.66) and high current happiness (Happy score of 5.0, Z-Score 1.64), which tend to correlate inversely with stress. Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Score of 6.0, Z-score 1.3). Behavioral data indicates moderate substance usage (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a week), no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and consistent engagement in physical activity, exercising alone and with others three times a week or more. Recreational habits include moderate internet usage, and engagement in reading for 16-30 minutes daily.

Conversely, certain aspects of the data may indicate areas of potential stress or suboptimal functioning, although these are less pronounced. The participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI score of 6.0, Z-Score -0.33), although this score is not significantly elevated above the population average for sleep disturbance. Sleep duration variability is somewhat higher than average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score 1.0), and sleep start times also exhibit some variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score 0.69). Physiological data reveals elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during late afternoon and early evening hours (3-4 PM: 21.34, Z-Score 2.24; 4-5 PM: 25.31, Z-Score 2.45), potentially reflecting periods of higher physiological arousal or stress during these times. Similarly, high intradaily variability in heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-Score 1.23) suggests less stable circadian rhythms.

Overall, the data suggests a participant who, despite some indicators of sleep disturbance and physiological arousal patterns in the late afternoon/early evening, generally exhibits psychological traits and self-reported behaviors associated with lower perceived stress. The low scores on depression and anxiety scales, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, point towards a resilient individual. The participant's PSS score is likely near the population mean for this study sample."
86440,"The participant exhibits several indicators that collectively suggest a relatively high level of perceived stress. Subjectively, the participant reports moderate sleep disturbance, with a PSQI score of 7.0, which is above the threshold for clinically significant sleep difficulties. This is accompanied by a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 1 minute, which, while not extremely short, may be insufficient to fully mitigate stress given the observed sleep disturbance. Furthermore, the daily recreation habits data reveals a significant amount of time spent on passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes) and internet usage (1-2 hours), which can be associated with lower levels of engagement and potentially higher stress levels. The absence of regular exercise, with 'Exercised Alone' occurring less than 1-2 times a month and 'Exercised with Others' only 1-2 times a month, further suggests a lack of stress-reducing physical activity. Notably, the participant's daily routine shows elevated physiological arousal during the late afternoon and early evening hours, indicated by the Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor reaching peaks between 2 PM and 3 PM (13.65), and continuing into the evening. This prolonged period of elevated heart rate, particularly when contrasted with generally lower heart rates during the early morning hours, points to an ongoing physiological strain. The participant's resting heart rate, at 51.0, is lower than the population mean, which, while not directly indicative of stress, suggests a potentially more sensitive autonomic nervous system response when stressors are present. The limited negative correlations with PSS for most leisure activities and the positive correlation for internet usage suggest that these habits are not effectively buffering perceived stress.

Conversely, certain aspects of the data may point towards factors that could mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of anxiety (STAI score of 38.0, classified as 'not anxious') and depressive symptoms (CESD score of 12.0, classified as 'Not depressed'). Self-esteem appears to be within a healthy range, with a score of 37.0 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Trust in others is also moderately high (Score of 3.5), and self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score of 0.55). The participant demonstrates significant engagement in sports (1-2 times a week), which is a positive behavioral factor for stress management. The circadian rhythm metric of Interdaily Stability is near the population mean (Z-score of -0.16), indicating a moderately regular daily cycle, and the Mesor (64.67) and Amplitude (8.91) are also within a reasonable range, not suggesting extreme circadian disruption. The sleep start time variability is also relatively low (Z-score of -0.7), indicating a more consistent sleep schedule, which is generally beneficial for stress regulation.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While indicators of good mental health (low anxiety, depression, and high self-esteem) and some positive habits like sports participation are present, the significant indicators of sleep disturbance, limited engagement in other stress-reducing activities, and evidence of sustained physiological arousal during the day suggest that perceived stress is a prominent concern. The substantial time dedicated to passive leisure and internet usage, coupled with a lack of consistent exercise, further supports this interpretation. The correlations with PSS, although not consistently strong, lean towards higher stress being associated with less engaging activities and potentially greater internet usage."
29792,"The participant exhibits a complex pattern of psychological and behavioral indicators, with several factors potentially contributing to a heightened perception of stress. Self-report measures reveal a moderate level of chronic anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 43.0 (Z-score: 0.17), which, while classified as ""anxious,"" is only slightly above the population mean. The participant also reports disturbed sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score: 0.13), exceeding the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and correlating negatively with their perceived stress. Behavioral data further suggest potential stress influences. Substance usage, particularly alcohol, is notable with beer consumption occurring ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.72) and wine or liquor ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.94). This frequency of alcohol consumption, especially beer, is significantly above the population average and warrants attention in the context of stress. Furthermore, the participant spends a considerable amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours daily, Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (31 minutes to 1 hour daily, Z-score: 1.71), which could represent coping mechanisms or sedentary behaviors that may not effectively mitigate stress. Physiologically, the participant's average mesor heart rate is lower than the population mean (Mesor: 69.94, Z-score: -0.55), and their resting heart rate is also notably lower (Value: 52.0, Z-score: -0.73), potentially indicating a baseline state of lower physiological arousal. However, the analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals marked elevations during the evening hours, specifically between 7-8 PM (Value: 23.64, Z-score: 2.12) and 8-9 PM (Value: 13.51, Z-score: 0.68), and to a lesser extent in the late evening and early morning. These pronounced peaks in cardiovascular activity during the latter part of the day and early night could be indicative of heightened physiological reactivity to stressors, particularly in the absence of effective stress management.

Conversely, several indicators suggest a lower perceived stress level. The participant reports high self-esteem (SelfEsteem Score: 40.0, Z-Score: 0.26), which is the maximum possible score and typically associated with resilience to stress. Their reported happiness level is also above the population mean (Happy Current Score: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55). Academic performance, as indicated by the Fall 2015 GPA of 3.21 and Fall 2016 GPA of 3.4, is within a range that does not strongly suggest significant academic stress is overriding other life domains. Moreover, the participant engages in regular social interaction with friends (1-2 hours daily, Z-score: 0.16) and exercises with others frequently (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.23), behaviors often associated with buffering stress. Physiologically, the relatively low mesor and resting heart rate, as previously noted, suggest a potentially calm baseline. The intradaily variability of heart rate (Value: 0.5, Z-Score: -0.32) is lower than average, suggesting a more stable daily pattern of physiological activity, which can be a sign of lower stress. The autocorrelation at 24 hours for heart rate (Value: 0.19, Z-score: -1.12) is also significantly below the population mean, indicating a weaker day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns, which might suggest less rigid adherence to daily routines and possibly more adaptation or less cyclical stress.

In summary, while the participant demonstrates protective factors such as high self-esteem and engagement in social activities, the presence of chronic anxiety, disturbed sleep, and elevated physiological arousal in the late evening and early night hours, coupled with significant alcohol consumption, collectively suggest a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. The PSS population mean is 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68, meaning a score above 25.3 would be considered in the top quartile. While the exact PSS score is not provided, the convergence of negative indicators points towards a position above the population mean. The notable evening heart rate elevations, despite a lower baseline, indicate that the participant may experience periods of heightened physiological stress, particularly in conjunction with their reported sleep disturbances and social habits."
14737,"This participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely falling near the population mean of 21.62 (SD 3.68). While several indicators point towards potential challenges, others suggest resilience and healthy habits.

Several factors suggest a higher perceived stress level. The participant reports a moderate level of trait anxiety (STAI score of 45.0, Z-score 0.37), which positively correlates with perceived stress (correlation of 0.31). Furthermore, their sleep patterns exhibit notable irregularity. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score -1.41), indicating a shortfall compared to typical recommendations. This short sleep duration is accompanied by significant variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.74) and sleep start time (Z-score 1.14), suggesting disrupted sleep hygiene. The PSQI score of 6.0, while falling within the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, is only slightly above the commonly cited threshold of 5, indicating a subjective experience of disturbed sleep but not necessarily severe. The intradaily variability of heart rate (Z-score 0.67) is also elevated, indicating greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, which can be indicative of physiological arousal and potentially stress.

Conversely, several aspects of this participant's profile suggest a lower perceived stress level or protective factors. Their self-esteem score is relatively high at 34.0 (Z-score -0.59), with a negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.15), indicating that higher self-esteem may buffer stress. Similarly, their reported happiness is above the population average (Score 4.0, Z-score 0.55), with a negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.19), suggesting a generally positive affect. Health satisfaction is moderate (Score 3.56, Z-score -0.53), and they report not using alcohol, wine, liquor, or recreational drugs, which are positive lifestyle choices with weak correlations to perceived stress. Physical activity levels are low, with limited engagement in exercising with others (Z-score -1.58) and sports (Z-score -1.09), but some engagement in exercising alone (Z-score -0.43). Their daily recreational habits include moderate video game usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.96) and sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41), which are common coping or leisure activities. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average (Value 54.2, Z-score -0.47), which is generally a positive physiological indicator.

In summary, while the participant exhibits signs of potential stress, particularly in sleep disruption and trait anxiety, their relatively high self-esteem, reported happiness, and generally healthy substance use habits likely counterbalance these factors, suggesting a perceived stress level that is likely near the study population mean."
28653,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data, alongside wearable-derived metrics, suggest a complex interplay of factors potentially influencing their perceived stress. Notably, the participant reports high levels of self-esteem (Z-score = 1.52) and happiness (Z-score = 1.64), and exhibits a low degree of trait anxiety (STAI score = 29.0, Z-score = -1.22) and depressive symptoms (CESD score = 6.0, Z-score = -0.76). Furthermore, their self-reported health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.63) is also elevated, indicating a positive overall outlook on their well-being. This cluster of high self-esteem, happiness, low anxiety and depressive symptoms, and high health satisfaction, all with positive Z-scores relative to the population mean, generally aligns with lower perceived stress. The participant also reports minimal substance usage and engages in regular exercise with others (frequency = three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.23), behaviors often associated with better stress management.

Conversely, certain behavioral patterns and physiological indicators may suggest a moderate to higher level of perceived stress. The participant's academic performance, as indicated by their GPA, shows a slight decline between the Fall 2015 (3.89) and Fall 2016 (3.52) semesters. Regarding daily habits, while many recreational activities are engaged in for limited durations, internet usage (Z-score = -1.16) and socialising with friends (Z-score = -1.41) are reported for longer durations than some other activities, which could reflect compensatory behaviors. From wearable data, the participant exhibits a significantly elevated amplitude (Z-score = 2.26) in their heart rate rhythm, suggesting a larger variation between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. This, coupled with a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 1.41) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 1.4), indicates a highly regular, but potentially rigid, circadian rhythm. The significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 3-4 PM with a Z-score of 3.82, and 4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.1), suggest periods of substantial physiological arousal that could be linked to perceived stressors during these times. Conversely, the Intradaily Variability of heart rate is notably low (Z-score = -2.08), suggesting less fluctuation in heart rate within a given day, which can sometimes be associated with lower physiological reactivity to immediate stressors, but also potentially a less adaptable physiological state.

Holistically, the participant's self-reported psychological state, characterized by high self-esteem, happiness, and low anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with favorable lifestyle choices like regular exercise, strongly points towards a generally lower perceived stress level. However, the observed academic decline and distinct patterns in heart rate variability, particularly the elevated amplitude and late afternoon/early evening arousal peaks, suggest that specific stressors or periods of heightened physiological demand may be present and contribute to their perceived stress. Based on the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While positive psychological indicators are strong, the physiological markers of significant diurnal heart rate variation and specific arousal peaks during academic or work-related hours suggest that perceived stress is not significantly below the average."
95559,"**Multimodal Analysis of Perceived Stress**

The participant exhibits several behavioral and physiological patterns that may inform their perceived stress levels. Notably, the **Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -1.98)** and **Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.8)** metrics derived from heart rate data are significantly lower than the population mean, suggesting a reduced regularity and structure in the participant's circadian rhythm. This is further supported by a low **Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: -1.29)**, indicating a diminished temporal predictability in their physiological activity. The **Amplitude (Z-score: -1.16)** of the circadian rhythm is also below average, potentially reflecting a blunted physiological response to daily cycles.

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a **Median Sleep Duration of 6 hours and 39 minutes**, which is associated with a negative Z-score (-0.66) and a weak negative correlation with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. This suggests that while their sleep duration is somewhat shorter than the population average, it may not be a primary driver of high perceived stress. However, the **Mean Daily Naps (Z-score: 2.07)** is notably high, indicating a significant tendency for napping. This could be an indicator of either seeking restorative periods or, conversely, a sign of fatigue or sleep deficiency that might contribute to perceived stress.

Several self-reported survey measures also provide insight. The **STAI Trait Anxiety score (29.0)** is relatively low (Z-score: -1.22), indicating low chronic anxiety proneness, and shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS. The **CES-D score (8.0)** is within the ""Not depressed"" classification (Z-score: -0.55), with a moderate positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that depressive symptoms are not a significant factor. **Self-Esteem (Score: 45.0)** has a positive Z-score of 0.96, indicating higher than average self-esteem, which generally correlates with lower stress. This is supported by a negative correlation with PSS. Similarly, **Health Satisfaction (Score: 3.56)** is below average (Z-score: -0.53), but shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that lower satisfaction with physical health is not strongly linked to higher perceived stress.

Regarding daily habits, the participant reports **Beer consumption of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.72)**, which is a higher frequency compared to the population average. This behavior shows a weak negative correlation with PSS. **Listening to Music (2-3 hours)** is also a significant daily activity (Z-score: 1.13), with a weak positive correlation with PSS. Conversely, the participant reports **not engaging in Reading** (Z-score: -0.67), which shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that this activity, if undertaken, might be associated with lower stress. The **PSQI score of 7.0** indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" and is slightly above the population mean (Z-score: 0.13), with a positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that subjective sleep quality concerns are associated with higher perceived stress.

The participant's physiological arousal patterns, as indicated by the **Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor** for heart rate, show increased activity during late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM, 9-10 PM), with deviations exceeding 7.0 bpm. This is particularly notable during periods that are typically associated with rest, and some of these deviations (e.g., 7-8 PM, 3-4 AM) show moderate positive correlations with PSS. The **Resting Heart Rate (Value: 54.1)** is below average (Z-score: -0.48), with a moderate positive correlation with PSS, implying that a lower resting heart rate might be associated with higher perceived stress in this participant.

Overall, the data suggests a participant with lower chronic anxiety and higher self-esteem, but with notable irregularities in their circadian rhythm and sleep patterns, including frequent naps and a tendency towards disturbed sleep. The higher frequency of alcohol consumption and elevated heart rate deviations during evening and early morning hours, coupled with a lower resting heart rate, warrant consideration.

**Comparison to Population Mean:** Based on the provided data and analysis, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. This inference is drawn from the combination of disturbed sleep patterns, potentially blunted circadian rhythms, and elevated heart rate deviations during rest periods, which tend to correlate with higher stress, even in the presence of low trait anxiety and high self-esteem."
30152,"The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be near the population mean, with a potential to be slightly below it. This assessment is informed by a combination of self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics. On the self-report side, the participant reports moderate levels of anxiety (STAI score of 41.0, with a Z-score of -0.03, indicating it is slightly below the average proneness to chronic anxiety within the study population) and no significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, with a Z-score of -0.24, suggesting a lower-than-average frequency of depressive symptoms). Self-esteem is within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 36.0, with a Z-score of -0.31). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is indicative of disturbed sleep (Score of 7.0, with a Z-score of 0.13), which could contribute to perceived stress. However, objective sleep duration is somewhat below average, with a median of 6 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score of -0.48). The consistency of sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of 0.41) suggests some irregularity in sleep schedules.

Further contributing to a moderate perceived stress level are several behavioral and physiological indicators. The participant engages in moderate levels of social drinking (Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 0.94) and watches a moderate amount of TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 1.28), while not engaging in recreational drug use or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits suggest a preference for solo workouts, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-Score: 1.07), but limited exercise with others or participation in sports. The participant also reports spending 2-3 hours on the internet daily (Z-Score: 0.85). Physiologically, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (Value of 49.4, Z-Score of -1.04), which is generally associated with lower physiological stress. The mesor of the circadian rhythm is also notably low (Value of 62.67, Z-score of -1.54), potentially indicating a more energy-conserving physiological state. The interdaily stability of heart rate is slightly below average (Value of 0.35, Z-Score of -0.49), suggesting some variability in daily routines.

Conversely, certain metrics might suggest elevated perceived stress. The PSQI score of 7.0 indicates disturbed sleep, a common correlate of higher stress. While anxiety scores are not high, the correlation with PSS is positive (0.31), suggesting that any level of anxiety is associated with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the hourly heart rate data reveals periods of significantly elevated cardiovascular arousal, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening. Specifically, the mean deviation from the mesor is notably high between 3-4 PM (18.77, Z-score 1.78), 4-5 PM (24.58, Z-score 2.34), and 5-6 PM (23.91, Z-score 1.95), as well as a moderate elevation between 7-8 PM (18.91, Z-score 1.29). These periods of pronounced physiological activation during typical daytime hours could indicate a physiological response to stress.

In summation, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean, with a tendency towards being slightly below average. While some indicators, such as subjective sleep quality and pronounced afternoon/early evening heart rate deviations, suggest potential stress contributors, the absence of high anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with a low resting heart rate and mesor, balances these factors. The observed pattern suggests a participant who experiences moderate physiological arousal during specific parts of the day, potentially linked to daily stressors, but does not report significant psychological distress or chronic anxiety, placing their overall perceived stress near the study group's average."
59592,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, positioned near the population mean. While several factors indicate potential stressors, others point to resilience and effective coping mechanisms.

Factors potentially contributing to a higher perceived stress level include elevated trait anxiety (STAI score of 46.0, z-score of 0.46, correlating positively with PSS), and a tendency towards more sedentary daily habits. Specifically, the participant engages in a notably high amount of 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies' (1-2 hours daily, z-score of 1.28) and 'Internet Usage' (2-3 hours daily, z-score of 0.85). Furthermore, the 'Intradaily Variability' of heart rate is quite high (z-score of 1.65), suggesting a less stable physiological rhythm throughout the day, which can be associated with increased arousal and potentially stress. The participant's 'Resting Heart Rate' is also above the population average (z-score of 0.95). A shorter average sleep duration (median of 6 hours 57 minutes, z-score of -0.29) and a highly variable sleep start time (standard deviation of 39 minutes, z-score of -0.97) also indicate potential sleep disturbances which are often linked to higher stress levels.

Conversely, several aspects of the participant's profile suggest a capacity for managing stress effectively. The participant reports generally good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score of 5.0 (z-score of -0.8) which falls within the ""Good Sleep"" classification. Self-esteem is relatively high (Self-Esteem score of 35.0, z-score of -0.45) and current happiness levels are above average (Happy score of 3.0, z-score of -0.53), with negative correlations to PSS scores, suggesting these factors may buffer stress. Physical health satisfaction is also above average (Health Satisfaction score of 3.67, z-score of -0.45). The participant also exhibits a strong pattern of reduced physical activity with others ('Exercised with Others' frequency is less than 1-2 times a month, z-score of -0.88), but maintains moderate exercise alone ('Exercised Alone' frequency is 1-2 times a week, z-score of 0.32), and engagement with sports is minimal ('Sports' frequency is not at all, z-score of -1.09). While the *intradaily variability* of heart rate is high, the *interdaily stability* of the circadian rhythm is relatively low (z-score of -0.9), indicating a less consistent daily structure in physiological patterns, which can be a marker of stress, but the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably low (z-score of -1.25), suggesting less pronounced daily fluctuations in physiological activity. The participant's consumption of wine or liquor is also above average (1-2 times a week, z-score of 0.94), and beer consumption is less frequent (less than 1-2 times a month, z-score of -0.41).

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, inferred from the available data, appears to be around the population mean for the study sample (Population PSS Mean: 21.61). The conflicting indicators, such as high trait anxiety and sedentary habits alongside higher self-esteem and good subjective sleep, create a nuanced picture. The elevated heart rate variability and reduced interdaily stability in circadian rhythms suggest some physiological strain, but the positive self-report measures offer counterbalancing evidence."
89652,"The participant’s self-reported data indicates a moderate level of perceived stress. While the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population mean is 21.6 with a standard deviation of 3.67, suggesting scores in the range of 18-25 are common, the participant’s specific PSS score is not provided. However, other indicators suggest a potentially elevated stress experience. The PSQI score of 4.0, with a Z-score of -1.26, classifies as good sleep quality, which might suggest a lower perceived stress. Similarly, low scores on the CES-D (5.0, Z-score -0.86) and STAI (35.0, Z-score -0.62) indicate minimal depressive symptoms and low chronic anxiety, respectively, which are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, a high level of trust (4.67, Z-score 2.75) and happiness (5.0, Z-score 1.64) are generally related to positive psychological well-being and lower stress. Positive academic performance, indicated by GPAs between 3.63 and 3.95, also does not point towards significant academic stress.

Conversely, several behavioral and physiological metrics suggest potential indicators of increased stress. The participant exhibits a higher than average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 1.3), which can be indicative of physiological dysregulation often associated with stress. The standard deviation of sleep duration is also elevated (Z-score 1.62), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns, a common consequence of stress. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below typical recommendations and can contribute to stress and reduced cognitive function, though the PSQI score suggests subjective good sleep quality. The mean daily naps (Z-score 1.49) could indicate compensatory behavior for insufficient nighttime sleep. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of significant deviation from the mesor. Notably, pronounced positive deviations are observed during the afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 3-4 PM with a Z-score of 1.61), suggesting increased physiological arousal during these times. This pattern of higher average heart rate during later daylight hours could be reflective of sustained stress responses throughout the day.

In summary, while the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, low anxiety, and depression, and high trust and happiness, several objective metrics point towards potential stressors. The elevated intradaily heart rate variability, inconsistent sleep duration patterns, and specific patterns of elevated heart rate during the afternoon and early evening hours are indicative of a physiological state that may be influenced by stress. Considering these factors, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**, with elements suggesting a potential for elevated stress that are not fully captured by their subjective reports or are perhaps being managed through other coping mechanisms."
28724,"This participant exhibits a psychological and behavioral profile that suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely falling near the population mean for the study sample. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the primary measure of perceived stress; while a direct score for the PSS is not provided in this dataset, we can infer the participant's standing relative to the population mean (M=21.62, SD=3.68) based on related metrics.

Several indicators suggest potentially higher perceived stress. The participant reports anxiety as a trait on the STAI, with a score of 40.0, classifying them as anxious. This trait is moderately positively correlated with PSS (r=0.31), suggesting that higher trait anxiety may be associated with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant's sleep patterns show some signs of irregularity. Their Median Sleep Start Time is late at 23:58:59, with a standard deviation of 28 minutes, indicating some variability in bedtime. The PSQI score of 6.0, while not exceptionally high, classifies as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and the wearable data reveals a high Intradaily Variability (Z-score=1.51), implying a less stable daily physiological rhythm. The participant also spends a notable amount of time watching TV/Videos/Movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score=0.64), which can sometimes be associated with passive coping mechanisms.

Conversely, several factors point towards a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports a high level of happiness (Score=5.0, Z-score=1.64), which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.19), indicating that greater happiness is associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-esteem is also within a healthy range (Score=39.0), with a minimal Z-score, and this measure shows a slight negative correlation with PSS (r=-0.15). The participant reports ""Not at all"" for Beer and Recreational Drugs usage, which are generally considered adaptive behaviors. They also exercise alone with a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score=1.07), a positive lifestyle choice. Their median sleep duration is 7 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score=0.79), which is on the longer side and negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.04), suggesting better sleep quantity. The MESOR (Value=70.67, Z-score=-0.45) and Amplitude (Value=9.02, Z-score=-0.57) of their heart rate rhythm are also below population averages, which might indicate a less demanding physiological state during the recording period.

Overall, the participant's profile presents a mixed picture. While some indices, particularly related to sleep variability and trait anxiety, suggest potential stressors, these are counterbalanced by strong indicators of well-being, including high reported happiness and good self-esteem. Considering the population statistics for PSS (Mean=21.62, 50th percentile=22.0), the absence of a direct PSS score prevents a definitive quantitative statement. However, the presence of significant positive coping resources (happiness, self-esteem, exercise) alongside moderate sleep disturbances and trait anxiety suggests that their overall perceived stress level is likely **near the population mean**. The correlations provided offer insight into associations, but the holistic view of the data indicates a balanced interplay of potentially stress-inducing and stress-alleviating factors."
69831,"This participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a pattern of moderate perceived stress, likely slightly above the population mean. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population mean is 21.63, and while a direct PSS score is not provided, the constellation of other metrics can inform this inference. The participant exhibits relatively low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D: 10.0, Z = -0.34) and general anxiety (STAI: 38.0, Z = -0.33), both of which are below the population mean for these metrics, indicating lower than average trait anxiety and current depressive symptomology. Self-esteem is also within a typical range, with a Z-score of -0.31 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Health satisfaction (Z = -1.2) is notably lower than the population average, suggesting potential dissatisfaction with physical health that may contribute to perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns indicate a lifestyle that may be associated with higher stress. While exercise frequency is low (Exercised Alone: Z = -1.93, Exercised with Others: Z = -1.58), the participant engages in moderate sports participation (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z = 0.91). Notably, there is significant engagement in sedentary leisure activities, with very high reported time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.06) and socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.53), alongside substantial internet usage (3-4 hours, Z = 1.52) and watching TV/videos/movies (2-3 hours, Z = 1.91). This pattern of high screen time and social engagement, coupled with low physical activity, may reflect coping mechanisms or contribute to elevated stress. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor consumption (1-2 times a week for both), is slightly above average, as indicated by positive Z-scores, which could be a minor contributing factor to stress.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal regular sleep patterns but potentially disrupted diurnal physiological rhythm. The median sleep duration is 8 hours (Z = 1.01), which is above average, suggesting sufficient sleep length. However, the median sleep start time is late (01:34:59) with a standard deviation of 35 minutes, indicating some variability and a later chronotype. The PSQI score of 6.0, while classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" is close to the threshold for clinically significant disturbance and its Z-score is -0.33, suggesting subjective sleep quality is only slightly poorer than average. The MESOR (average heart rate) of 71.67 bpm (Z = -0.31) is below average, suggesting a potentially lower basal heart rate. The circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (0.38, Z = -0.24) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.32, Z = -0.03), are near the population average, indicating a moderately stable daily rhythm. However, the Intradaily Variability (0.44, Z = -0.74) is lower than average, which might imply less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, potentially related to more sedentary periods. The hourly deviation from the mesor data reveals the most significant deviations in the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am: -19.96, Z = -0.57; 4-5 am: -22.31, Z = -0.70), followed by elevated heart rates in the evening (e.g., 7-8 pm: 18.13, Z = 1.15; 6-7 pm: 17.3, Z = 0.83), which deviates from typical patterns and could reflect physiological stress responses or a disrupted diurnal cycle, correlating positively with PSS for these specific hours.

Considering the combination of factors, the participant's perceived stress is inferred to be near the population mean. The lower scores on anxiety and depression scales, coupled with adequate sleep duration, suggest resilience in these areas. However, the low health satisfaction, significant engagement in sedentary leisure activities, and particularly the evening elevations in heart rate deviation from the mesor point towards potential stressors or a physiological response pattern that may elevate perceived stress. The overall pattern suggests a lifestyle that, while not indicative of severe psychological distress, presents elements that could contribute to a perceived stress level that is likely at or slightly above the population average."
44927,"The participant's overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the provided data, appears to be **above the population mean**. This conclusion is supported by a confluence of self-reported and physiological indicators. The participant reports a higher than average level of trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, which has a positive correlation with perceived stress. Furthermore, while self-esteem is within the average range and depression symptoms are low, indicating no significant underlying mood disorders, other factors suggest elevated stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a relatively low engagement in typical stress-reducing activities, such as exercising with others or engaging in sedentary hobbies for extended periods. Conversely, they report a high frequency of sports participation, which, while beneficial, may also indicate a demanding schedule. Sleep data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average and has a negative correlation with perceived stress. The variability in sleep start times is also higher than average, suggesting potential disruptions in sleep regularity.

Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a diurnal pattern characterized by elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during waking hours, particularly in the morning and late afternoon. The 7-8 AM hourly deviation of +5.25 and the 9-10 AM deviation of +9.75, both significantly above average, suggest a heightened physiological arousal during these periods, potentially indicative of the body's stress response. The relatively low resting heart rate and mesor values might suggest a physically fit individual, but the overall pattern of heart rate deviation during the day is more indicative of stress-induced activation rather than relaxation. The reduced interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability in heart rate, though not statistically extreme, also contribute to the picture of a less regulated circadian rhythm, which can be associated with higher stress. The negative correlations observed between certain physiological measures (e.g., Amplitude, Resting Heart Rate) and perceived stress, while present, are less impactful in this overall assessment than the direct indicators of anxiety and sleep disturbance.

In summary, the combination of elevated trait anxiety, shorter and more variable sleep duration, and physiological indicators of increased arousal during typical daily activities points towards a perceived stress level that is likely higher than the population mean. While there are positive lifestyle aspects such as high sports participation, these may be undertaken within a context of existing stress."
71894,"This participant exhibits a complex profile with indicators suggesting elevated perceived stress, alongside certain mitigating factors. Self-reported measures reveal significant elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 34.0, Z-score 2.15) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 64.0, Z-score 2.24), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28 and 0.31, respectively). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 19.0, Z-score -2.7), which is negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.15), potentially serving as a protective factor against further stress escalation, though the overall high anxiety and depression scores suggest this protective effect may be limited. Self-reported happiness is also below the population average (Current Happiness score of 2.0, Z-score -1.61), further supporting a disposition towards lower well-being. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score of 6.0, Z-Score -0.33), falling just above the threshold for clinically significant disturbance, and is associated with a negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.15).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in significant internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and listening to music for extended periods (Z-score 2.06), which are moderately correlated with perceived stress (0.11 and 0.07, respectively). While these habits could represent coping mechanisms or indicators of disengagement, the positive correlations suggest they may be associated with higher stress levels in this context. Conversely, the participant reports less frequent substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and demonstrates a commitment to exercise, specifically exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), which shows a modest negative correlation with perceived stress (0.04). However, the lack of participation in sports (Z-score -1.09) and less frequent exercise with others (Z-score 0.53) may indicate a more solitary approach to physical activity, potentially limiting social support benefits. Reading frequency, although relatively low (15 minutes or less), shows a negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.21), suggesting it may be a stress-reducing activity.

Physiological data from the wearable device present a mixed picture. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits moderate regularity (Interdaily Stability of 0.47, Z-score 0.5) but with higher than average variability within the day (Intradaily Variability of 0.66, Z-score 0.81), which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.16). The Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is slightly elevated (Value of 80.91, Z-score 0.95), and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (Value of 8.47, Z-score -0.75), suggesting a potentially blunted daily physiological fluctuation. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (Value of 63.6, Z-score 0.65) and shows a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (0.14). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor indicates significant elevations during typical waking hours, particularly between 6-7 AM (Z-score 4.44) and 7-8 AM (Z-score 4.61), suggesting a strong physiological response to morning demands, which is positively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, periods of lower than average heart rate deviation are observed during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, Z-score -1.88; 1-2 AM, Z-score -1.35), potentially reflecting a delayed wind-down or impaired recovery. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes (Z-score -0.58), which is shorter than ideal and negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.05). The standard deviation of sleep duration is also relatively high (Value of 54 minutes, Z-score -1.06), suggesting some variability in sleep consolidation, which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.14). The median sleep start time is late (23:55:28), with a standard deviation of 58 minutes (Z-score -0.56), suggesting a tendency towards inconsistent sleep timing.

Overall, the participant’s perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. The combination of significantly elevated self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with high internet usage and physiological indicators such as increased intradaily heart rate variability and elevated morning heart rates, strongly suggests a substantial perceived stress burden. While certain factors like low self-esteem, reduced substance use, and moderate engagement in solitary exercise may present as potential buffers, they are not sufficient to counteract the overall pattern of distress. The disturbed sleep quality further contributes to the impression of an individual experiencing considerable stress."
30453,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with several indicators potentially influencing their perceived stress levels. A notable area of concern is their subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a significantly elevated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (Z-score of 4.29). This score is considerably higher than the study population's mean, suggesting a substantial degree of disturbed sleep, which is frequently associated with increased stress. Furthermore, their median sleep duration is 6 hours and 25 minutes, which is below the typical recommended range and exhibits a Z-score of -0.96, indicating shorter sleep duration compared to the population. While the standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly elevated (Z-score of 1.0), suggesting some variability, the overall sleep quantity and quality appear to be contributing factors to a higher perceived stress experience.

Other self-reported measures also point towards potential stress contributors. The participant reports a CES-D score of 31.0 (Z-score of 1.84), which is in the ""Depressed"" classification and higher than the population mean, indicating a greater burden of depressive symptoms. Similarly, their STAI Trait anxiety score is 51.0 (Z-score of 0.96), suggesting a propensity for higher chronic anxiety. These elevated scores for depressive symptoms and anxiety are positively correlated with perceived stress, further reinforcing the hypothesis of a higher stress level. Conversely, lower self-esteem (Z-score of -1.57), lower reported happiness (Z-score of -1.61), and lower health satisfaction (Z-score of -1.11) are also observed, all of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress and suggest a potentially more vulnerable psychological state.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in some activities that could mitigate stress. They report exercising with others ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score of 1.23) and participating in sports ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score of 1.58). These higher frequencies of social and structured physical activity are negatively correlated with perceived stress, potentially acting as protective factors. Additionally, they spend considerable time reading (Z-score of 2.28) and listening to music (Z-score of 2.06), activities that can be associated with relaxation and enjoyment and are also negatively correlated with perceived stress. However, the participant also reports high internet usage (Z-score of 0.18) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score of 1.41), which have weaker or negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting a mixed pattern of behavioral engagement.

Physiological data from the wearable provides additional context. The participant's resting heart rate is noted to be 67.5 bpm (Z-score of 1.11), which is above the population mean, suggesting a slightly elevated baseline physiological arousal. The intradaily variability of heart rate is also high (Z-score of 0.6), indicating greater fluctuations throughout the day, which can be indicative of stress or a more dynamic physiological state. The mesor of the heart rate is 80.18 (Z-score of 0.85), also above the population mean. The aggregated hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal heightened arousal during the early morning hours, specifically from 3 AM to 7 AM, with deviations ranging from -13.43 to -2.11. This pattern, particularly the significant deviations during sleep hours, aligns with the reported poor sleep quality and may reflect physiological disruptions. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is noted as 3:51 PM.

Considering the combined self-report and physiological data, the participant appears to experience a relatively high level of perceived stress. The significantly elevated PSQI score, coupled with higher scores on the CES-D and STAI, lower self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, strongly indicate a heightened stress experience. While engaging in social exercise and activities like reading and listening to music may offer some buffering, the physiological indicators, particularly the elevated resting heart rate and disruptions in daily heart rate patterns coinciding with reported poor sleep, reinforce this interpretation. Based on the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely above the population mean for this study sample."
66047,"This analysis synthesizes self-report survey data and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics to interpret perceived stress levels. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, as inferred from the aggregate data, appears to be **near the population mean**, which is calculated at 21.61 with a standard deviation of 3.68. The participant's PSS score likely falls within the range of 20.0 to 24.0, encompassing the 25th to 75th percentile of the study sample.

Several factors suggest a moderate level of perceived stress. The participant exhibits elevated levels of anxiety, as indicated by a Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 73.0 (Z-score: 3.13), classifying them as ""anxious."" This is further supported by a significantly high score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) of 46.0 (Z-score: 3.4), classifying them as ""depressed,"" which is positively correlated with perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also compromised, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52), indicating ""disturbed sleep,"" and is also positively correlated with perceived stress. The participant's self-reported happiness is below the population average (current score of 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), and they report lower than average health satisfaction (score of 1.22, Z-score: -2.28).

Conversely, some indicators suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level. The participant demonstrates higher than average self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 21.0, Z-Score: -2.42), which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Their trust in others is near the population average (Trust score of 2.83, Z-Score: -0.78). Behaviorally, the participant reports low engagement in substance use and recreational activities. Notably, they spend a significant amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 3.17) and using the internet (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.19), which show weak positive and negative correlations with perceived stress, respectively. While exercise habits are minimal, particularly exercising with others (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-Score: -1.58), indicating potential social withdrawal, this is not strongly associated with perceived stress.

Analysis of wearable data reveals several patterns. The participant has a higher than average resting heart rate (Value: 68.4, Z-Score: 1.22), which is moderately positively correlated with perceived stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows deviations from the mesor, with pronounced positive deviations occurring during late morning and nighttime hours (e.g., 10-11pm: 10.57, Z-score: 0.65). The circadian rhythm metrics indicate an acrophase around 6:35 PM, suggesting a relatively late peak in the daily heart rate cycle. Sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 15 minutes (Z-Score: 0.08), which is close to the population average, but a higher than average number of daily naps (Value: 0.28, Z-Score: 2.4), which is positively correlated with perceived stress. Intradaily variability of heart rate is slightly elevated (Value: 0.58, Z-Score: 0.24), suggesting a degree of physiological variability throughout the day. Overall, the physiological data, particularly the elevated resting heart rate and higher than average naps, aligns with a moderate level of perceived stress."
79834,"The participant exhibits a multimodal profile that appears to be associated with a PSS score likely near or slightly below the population mean. This inference is based on several indicators from self-report surveys, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics.

Regarding self-reported measures, the participant reports a low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 8.0, z-score of -0.55), is classified as ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score of 37.0, z-score of -0.43), and indicates a moderate level of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 37.0, z-score of -0.17). Their reported happiness is also somewhat below the population average (z-score of -0.53). The participant's PSQI score of 6.0 falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" category, exceeding the common threshold for significant sleep disturbance, though its z-score of -0.33 suggests it is not markedly worse than the population. Trust in others is notably low, with a z-score of -1.42, suggesting a potential area of social vulnerability. Despite a healthy BMI (24.33), health satisfaction is slightly above average (z-score of 0.55).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular consumption of wine or liquor (""Three times a week or more,"" z-score of 1.68), while abstaining from beer and recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is notably low, with infrequent engagement in exercising alone (z-score of -1.18), exercising with others (z-score of -1.58), and sports (z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational habits include moderate amounts of watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, with limited time spent listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals a generally regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by an interdaily stability z-score of -0.33 and an autocorrelation at 24 hours z-score of 0.64, suggesting some level of daily regularity. The resting heart rate is below the population average (z-score of -0.62), and the mesor is also lower than average (z-score of -0.57). The amplitude of heart rate variation is above the population average (z-score of 0.56), suggesting a greater range in daily heart rate fluctuations. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals periods of significantly elevated heart rate during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 9-10pm, z-score of 1.61; 6-7pm, z-score of 1.36), and also during mid-afternoon (2-3pm, z-score of 1.19). Conversely, notable dips in heart rate from the mesor occur in the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am, z-score of -0.7; 1-2am, z-score of -0.85). Sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 18 minutes, z-score of 1.39), but the median sleep start time of 00:46:30 is relatively late. Sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability are within a reasonable range, with standard deviations of 85 minutes and 52 minutes respectively. The absence of daily naps is also noted (z-score of -0.86).

In summation, the participant's relatively low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with moderate self-esteem and happiness, suggest a baseline psychological well-being that might mitigate higher perceived stress. However, the disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI, alongside significant alcohol consumption and very low levels of physical activity and social interaction, represent potential stressors. The observed patterns of elevated heart rate in the late evening/night and mid-afternoon, contrasted with pronounced reductions in the early morning, may reflect physiological responses to these lifestyle factors. Considering the overall profile, the participant's perceived stress level is likely near or below the population mean."
33133,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted profile that warrants careful consideration when inferring perceived stress levels. Self-report data reveal elevated scores in the CES-D (Z-score: 1.84) and STAI (Z-score: 0.76), suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively. These findings are particularly salient as the CES-D score of 31.0 is classified as ""Depressed"" and the STAI score of 49.0 is classified as ""anxious,"" indicating a significant subjective experience of negative affect. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z-Score: 1.98), which is well above the typical threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This self-reported poor sleep quality is corroborated by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is below the population average as suggested by its negative Z-score of -0.68. The sleep duration also exhibits a notably low standard deviation (Z-Score: -0.85), implying a consistent but insufficient amount of sleep. Conversely, the participant reports higher academic performance (GPA ranging from 3.23 to 3.85) and moderate levels of social interaction (Socializing with Friends: 1-2 hours). While self-esteem is near the population average (Z-Score: -0.17), the combination of high depressive symptoms, anxiety, and poor sleep quality strongly suggests a relatively high perceived stress level.

Analysis of wearable data provides further context for understanding the participant's physiological and behavioral patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is within the average range for the population (Z-Score: 0.05). However, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of higher-than-average physiological arousal during typical waking hours, particularly between 8-9 AM (Z-Score: 2.09) and 5-6 PM (Z-Score: 0.83), and notably during the late morning hours of 4-5 AM and 5-6 AM (Z-Scores: -0.57 and -0.44, respectively, when deviation is compared to the mesor). This pattern of heightened cardiovascular activity during periods that typically precede or overlap with waking hours, coupled with significant negative deviations from the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -19.97, 4-5 AM: -21.56), could be indicative of disrupted sleep-wake cycles or physiological responses to stress that manifest during these times. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a slightly lower-than-average interdaily stability (Z-Score: -0.08), suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns, and a higher-than-average intradaily variability (Z-Score: 0.6), which can be associated with more fragmented physiological activity throughout the day. These physiological indicators, especially the elevated arousal during waking hours and fragmented rhythm, align with the self-reported elevated stress and poor sleep.

Considering the data holistically, the participant's profile suggests a relatively high perceived stress level. The confluence of elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, significantly disturbed sleep quality, and insufficient sleep duration are strong indicators of heightened stress. While academic performance is a positive indicator, it appears to be maintained despite considerable subjective distress and physiological disruption. The wearable data, particularly the heightened heart rate deviations during waking and early morning hours and reduced circadian stability, further supports the inference of an underlying stress response that impacts physiological regulation. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is inferred to be **above the population mean**. This conclusion is primarily driven by the strong self-reported indicators of psychological distress and sleep disturbance, which are consistently associated with higher perceived stress."
47810,"**Psychological and Behavioral Correlates of Perceived Stress**

The participant exhibits a pattern of characteristics that suggest a moderate level of perceived stress, appearing to be near the population mean for perceived stress. While several indicators point towards a higher perceived stress level, other factors suggest a degree of resilience or adaptive coping. Notably, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-Score = 1.05), which is above the commonly accepted threshold for clinical significance and falls in the upper quartile of the study population. This is further corroborated by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 40 minutes (Z-Score = -0.65), which is below the population average. The significant positive correlation between PSQI score and PSS (0.37, though not explicitly provided, is inferred by the positive correlation values for related metrics) suggests that poorer subjective sleep quality is associated with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a high intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-Score = 2.01), indicating a less stable circadian rhythm and potentially heightened physiological reactivity, which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.16). This physiological dysregulation may contribute to increased stress perception.

Conversely, several factors suggest a lower perceived stress or buffering mechanisms. The participant reports low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Score = 37.0, Z-Score = -0.43) and is classified as ""not anxious,"" with a modest positive correlation to PSS (0.31), suggesting that while higher anxiety is associated with stress, this participant's baseline anxiety is low. Similarly, self-reported happiness is relatively low (Current = 3.0, Z-Score = -0.53), with a mild negative correlation to PSS (-0.19), implying that lower happiness might be slightly related to higher stress, but not a primary driver in this case. The participant also demonstrates healthy lifestyle choices, such as not engaging in substance usage (Beer: ""Not at all,"" Recreational Drugs: ""Not at all""), moderate wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-Score = 0.94), and regular exercise (Exercised Alone, Exercised with Others, and Sports all at 1-2 times a week). While the correlation between exercise and PSS is generally low and mixed, the presence of these habits can be interpreted as a potential coping mechanism. Furthermore, the participant's GPA is consistently high across academic terms (ranging from 3.51 to 3.58), indicating academic success which might buffer against stress. The mean aggregate deviation from mesor data indicates a pattern of physiological activation during the evening and early night hours (e.g., 6-7pm to 9-10pm show deviations above zero, with values up to 18.79), and a notable dip in heart rate deviation during the early morning hours (3-4am and 4-5am), which is likely reflective of the sleep period, though the reported sleep duration is suboptimal. The latter observation, along with a relatively low resting heart rate (Value = 56.3, Z-Score = -0.22), might suggest a generally healthy cardiovascular baseline.

In conclusion, this participant's data indicates a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean. The primary indicators for heightened stress are compromised sleep quality and elevated intradaily heart rate variability. However, the presence of low trait anxiety, consistent academic performance, and engagement in regular physical activity may serve as protective factors. The observed physiological patterns, particularly the deviations from the mesor throughout the day and night, combined with the suboptimal sleep duration, suggest that further investigation into the interplay between sleep, physiological arousal, and subjective stress perception would be beneficial."
58196,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a profile generally associated with lower levels of perceived stress. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 6.0, Z-score -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02), both of which are indicators that do not correlate with increased perceived stress. While the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 46.0 is high, indicating strong self-worth, its correlation with PSS is weakly negative (-0.16), suggesting higher self-esteem is associated with marginally lower stress. Furthermore, the participant reports high happiness (Z-score 1.64), with a negative correlation to PSS (-0.19), aligning with a lower perceived stress profile. Subjective health satisfaction is high (Z-score 1.38), and trust in others is near the population average (Z-score 0.18).

Lifestyle habits also lean towards lower stress indicators. The participant engages in moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported as 1-2 times per week, neither showing a strong positive correlation with PSS. Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Physical activity is frequent, with exercise alone and with others occurring ""Three times a week or more,"" with the latter exhibiting a slight negative correlation with PSS (-0.02). Sedentary leisure activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and extended internet usage are reported at low frequencies or durations, with reading also being infrequent (""Do not do""). These lower engagement levels in passive or potentially time-consuming leisure activities, coupled with higher physical activity, are generally associated with better stress management.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data provide further insights. The participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (Value 53.4, Z-score -0.56), which can be indicative of good cardiovascular health and lower baseline physiological arousal. The mesor, representing the average heart rate across the 24-hour cycle, is also below the population average (Value 66.57, Z-score -1.01). While intradaily variability is higher than the population average (Value 0.66, Z-score 0.81), this metric, in isolation, does not strongly predict perceived stress in this dataset. The participant's sleep duration, with a median of 6 hours and 33 minutes, is below the population average (Z-score -0.79), which could potentially indicate stress, but this is offset by a good subjective sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-Score -1.26) and a classification of ""Good Sleep."" The sleep start time is consistently around 1 AM, with a standard deviation suggesting some regularity. The hourly deviations from the mesor for heart rate show generally lower-than-average heart rates during early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM), followed by periods of higher than average heart rate during late morning and afternoon (e.g., 7-10 AM, 12-2 PM, 3-5 PM, 9-10 PM). These patterns do not show a clear monotonic relationship with PSS scores in this dataset.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, inferred from the comprehensive analysis of self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, appears to be **near the population mean**. While several factors suggest lower stress (e.g., low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise), the slightly below-average sleep duration, and certain heart rate variability patterns, in the absence of a direct PSS score, suggest a balanced profile that aligns closely with the study's average."
62246,"The participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean for perceived stress. Several indicators point towards a relatively neutral or slightly lower perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score -0.82), both of which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is high (Score 45.0, Z-Score 0.96), which is often inversely related to stress. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as good (Score 3.0, Z-Score -1.72). Furthermore, the participant engages in frequent exercise, particularly exercising alone (Frequency 'Three times a week or more', Z-Score 1.07), which is a positive coping behavior. Daily recreation habits indicate moderate engagement in video games, internet usage, and socializing with friends, with minimal time spent on watching TV/videos/movies or listening to music.

Conversely, some aspects of the data might suggest potential contributors to stress or lower overall well-being, although their correlations with PSS are generally weak. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores indicating a higher-than-population frequency of consumption for beer (Z-Score 1.01). Health satisfaction is moderately positive (Score 5.11, Z-score 0.63). Wearable data reveals a mesor (average daily heart rate) of 78.05 bpm (Z-score 0.56) and an amplitude of 12.24 bpm (Z-score 0.47), suggesting a reasonably active cardiovascular system. The interdaily stability of heart rate is moderate (Value 0.44, Z-Score 0.25), indicating some regularity in daily patterns, while intradaily variability is notably low (Value 0.32, Z-Score -1.59), suggesting a less dynamic heart rate fluctuation throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak in the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon (4:23 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show higher than average deviations during the early morning hours (3-6 AM), which could be indicative of physiological activation during this period, with significant positive deviations appearing from 8 AM onwards, peaking in the early afternoon.

Considering the balance of these factors, the participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean. The strong indicators of good mental health (low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem), positive coping behaviors (frequent exercise), and good subjective sleep quality outweigh the moderate substance use and the pattern of heart rate variability. The participant's overall perceived stress level is assessed as being near the mean of the study sample."
55424,"This participant presents a complex profile with indicators of both heightened and diminished perceived stress. On one hand, several self-reported measures suggest a degree of psychological distress and potential impairment. The participant's score on the CES-D scale (35.0) is significantly elevated (Z-score of 2.26), indicating a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28). Similarly, the STAI-Trait anxiety score (57.0) is notably high (Z-score of 1.55), suggesting a predisposition to chronic anxiety, and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31). Furthermore, the participant reports very poor subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 14.0, which is substantially above the typical threshold for sleep disturbance (Z-score of 3.37). Subjectively, the participant also reports low levels of happiness (Current score of 2.0, Z-score of -1.61), which aligns with a lower self-reported happiness and a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.19). The significant number of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.24, Z-Score: 1.9) also suggests potential issues with daytime fatigue or poor sleep quality, which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.13).

Conversely, certain behavioral and physiological metrics indicate more stable or potentially less stressful patterns. The participant demonstrates high academic performance, with GPAs consistently above 3.8 across multiple semesters, and their self-esteem score is near average (Z-score of -0.87), with a slight negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.15). In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in exercise with others frequently (Three times a week or more, Z-Score: 1.23), and this behavior shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.02). While substance usage (beer and wine/liquor) is reported at a moderate frequency (1-2 times a month), recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all,"" which could be considered a positive health behavior. The wearable data indicates a relatively regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by moderate interdaily stability (Value: 0.42, Z-Score: 0.09) and intradaily variability (Value: 0.48, Z-Score: -0.46). The mesor (average heart rate level) is close to the population mean (Value: 72.96, Z-Score: -0.13), and the resting heart rate is also within a typical range (Value: 57.6, Z-Score: -0.07). The sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 24 minutes, Z-Score: 0.27) is slightly above average, and the standard deviation of sleep duration is notably low (Value: 69 minutes, Z-Score: -0.72), suggesting consistent sleep timing.

Holistically, the data suggests that this participant experiences a **relatively high level of perceived stress**. While some physiological and behavioral indicators point towards stability, the overwhelming presence of elevated scores in depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, and sleep disturbance, coupled with low self-reported happiness, strongly suggests a significant burden of perceived stress. The participant's overall perceived stress level is likely **above the population mean**. The population mean for the Perceived Stress Scale is 21.61, with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. Given the significant elevations in CES-D and STAI-Trait, and the highly disturbed sleep indicated by the PSQI, it is reasonable to infer a PSS score that would place them above the average for this study sample."
23576,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data indicate a generally lower-than-average perceived stress level. This is supported by low scores on measures of depression (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72), both of which are below the population mean and suggest a lack of significant depressive or anxious symptomatology. Self-esteem scores (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score: 0.96) are notably high, indicating a strong sense of self-worth, which often correlates with lower perceived stress. Happiness levels (Current Z-score: -0.53) are also below average, though this may not directly indicate stress but rather a neutral or slightly less than optimally happy state. Furthermore, the participant reports no substance usage and engages in regular physical activity, including exercising alone frequently and participating in sports and exercising with others weekly. While recreational screen time such as watching TV/videos and playing video games is above average, dedicated reading habits are notably absent. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (Z-score: -0.33), suggests disturbed sleep, which is a factor often associated with higher stress, but the overall picture from self-report remains on the lower end of perceived stress.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data provides a nuanced view that, on balance, continues to suggest a relatively low perceived stress level, albeit with specific points of attention. The participant exhibits a regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a relatively high interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.5) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 1.06), suggesting a structured daily routine. The mesor (average heart rate) is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.35), and the resting heart rate is also very close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.07). While the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is close to the mean (Z-score: -0.1), the acrophase at 4:05 PM suggests a typical peak in daily activity. The hourly deviation from the mesor reveals several periods of elevated physiological arousal during daylight hours, particularly between 9 AM and 12 PM, and again from 3 PM to 5 PM, with significant positive deviations indicating higher heart rates than expected for those times. This pattern, especially the elevated arousal during midday and early afternoon, could be interpreted as a response to daily demands or activities. However, the overall sleep duration is longer than the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.72), indicating sufficient time spent asleep, even if subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed. The variability in sleep duration and start times is relatively low, suggesting consistent sleep schedules, which is typically associated with lower stress.

In summary, the participant's data collectively suggests a lower-than-average perceived stress level compared to the study population. While subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed, this is counterbalanced by low scores on measures of anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, regular exercise habits, and a relatively stable circadian rhythm. The observed peaks in heart rate deviation during waking hours are present but do not appear to manifest as high levels of subjective distress or significant disruptions in core physiological regulation or daily routines, thus supporting a conclusion that the participant experiences perceived stress at a level **below the population mean**."
93485,"This participant exhibits several indicators that, in isolation, suggest a relatively lower perceived stress level. Their self-reported scores on the CES-D scale (6.0) and STAI-Trait (35.0) are below the population mean, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" respectively. This is further supported by their generally positive self-esteem (Score: 44.0, Z-Score: 0.82) and moderate level of happiness (Z-Score: -0.53). Subjectively, their sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Score: 5.0, Z-Score: -0.8). Behaviorally, the participant reports very low usage of recreational and non-prescribed drugs, and a moderate frequency of alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week). They engage in regular solitary exercise three times a week or more, which is above average for the sample (Z-Score: 1.07). While they do not engage in sports or exercise with others, and their sedentary recreational habits are low (e.g., watching TV/videos/movies: ""Do not do""), their internet usage and listening to music habits are within moderate ranges.

Conversely, several factors point towards potential areas of stress or suboptimal regulation. The participant's amplitude of heart rate variability (Value: 16.65, Z-Score: 1.9) is notably high, indicating a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate, which can sometimes be associated with stress. Their resting heart rate is also relatively low (Value: 47.3, Z-Score: -1.29), which in isolation is generally positive, but in conjunction with high amplitude could suggest a system that is easily aroused. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant negative deviations from the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: -29.13, Z-Score: -2.03; 4-5 AM: -32.15, Z-Score: -2.33; 5-6 AM: -32.26, Z-Score: -2.02), suggesting periods of significantly reduced cardiovascular activity during these times, potentially indicative of sleep disruption or prolonged inactivity. The participant also exhibits a higher than average interdaily stability of their heart rate rhythm (Value: 0.53, Z-Score: 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.47, Z-Score: 1.23), suggesting a more rigid daily pattern, which, combined with the negative deviations during early morning, might indicate an inflexible circadian rhythm or difficulty transitioning between states. Their sleep duration is close to the median for the study (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 1 minute, Z-Score: -0.2), but the standard deviation of sleep duration is within the lower range (Value: 70 minutes, Z-Score: -0.69), suggesting some consistency but not necessarily optimal regularity. Their sleep start time median is very late (00:58:14), and the standard deviation is moderate (Value: 81 minutes, Z-Score: -0.05).

Considering the overall profile, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean for the study sample. While their self-reported psychological measures and sleep quality indicators suggest a relatively low stress experience, the physiological data, particularly the high amplitude of heart rate variability and pronounced negative deviations during early morning hours, along with strong circadian rhythm stability, could indicate underlying physiological stress responses or suboptimal regulation that are not fully captured by subjective reporting. The positive correlations between certain physiological metrics and PSS scores (e.g., Intradaily Variability and PSS) further suggest that these physiological patterns might be associated with stress."
62617,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a potentially elevated level of perceived stress. This inference is supported by several indicators, including lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-Score: 1.24, correlation with PSS: -0.15) and a heightened sense of happiness (Current Score: 5.0, Z-Score: 1.64, correlation with PSS: -0.19). Additionally, the participant exhibits a lower than population average interdaily stability of heart rate (Value: 0.2, Z-Score: -1.73, correlation with PSS: -0.13) and a higher than population average intradaily variability (Value: 0.34, Z-Score: -1.45, correlation with PSS: 0.15), which can reflect a less regulated physiological state. The participant's health satisfaction is also slightly above the population mean (Score: 4.78, Z-score: 0.38, correlation with PSS: -0.07), which could be interpreted in conjunction with other metrics.

Conversely, several aspects of the participant's data do not strongly indicate elevated stress. The participant reports not experiencing significant depressive symptoms (CES-D Score: 1.0, Z-score: -1.28, correlation with PSS: 0.28) or chronic anxiety (STAI Score: 28.0, Z-score: -1.31, correlation with PSS: 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Score: 5.0, Z-Score: -0.8), and sleep duration appears to be longer than average (Median Sleep Duration: 8 hours 25 minutes, Z-Score: 1.53, correlation with PSS: -0.04). The participant also reports higher than average trust of others (Score: 4.0, Z-Score: 1.47, correlation with PSS: -0.03). Regarding daily activities, the participant engages in exercise more frequently than the population average, both alone (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more', Z-Score: 1.07, correlation with PSS: 0.04) and with others (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z-Score: 0.53, correlation with PSS: -0.01), and participates in sports (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z-Score: 0.91, correlation with PSS: -0.12). Substance usage is moderate, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 0.94, correlation with PSS: 0.03), while beer, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs are used less frequently or not at all. Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Time: '16-30 minutes', Z-Score: 0.01, correlation with PSS: 0.04) and internet usage (Time: '16-30 minutes', Z-Score: -1.16, correlation with PSS: 0.1), with minimal reported time spent on video games, listening to music, socializing, reading, or sedentary hobbies.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean. While there are several protective factors evident in the data, such as low reported anxiety and depression, good subjective sleep quality, and active lifestyle, the lower self-esteem, higher reported happiness, and significantly disrupted circadian rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability) suggest an underlying elevation in perceived stress. The academic GPA, while showing a slight downward trend across semesters, remains high (2016 Fall GPA: 3.54), which may indicate resilience in the face of academic demands. The Mesor of the participant’s heart rate is slightly above the population mean (Value: 78.2, Z-Score: 0.58, correlation with PSS: 0.06), and resting heart rate is also slightly above the population mean (Value: 60.6, Z-Score: 0.29, correlation with PSS: 0.14), which could be indicative of a generally higher physiological arousal state. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows periods of lower-than-average heart rate deviation from the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), which, in conjunction with sleep duration data, might suggest some disruption in sleep architecture or arousal patterns that could contribute to perceived stress."
42137,"The participant's psychological and behavioral data suggest a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean for the study sample. While several factors indicate a lower perceived stress, there are also indicators of potential psychological strain.

Self-reported measures present a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively low score on the CES-D scale (15.0, Z-score 0.18), suggesting infrequent depressive symptoms, which aligns with lower perceived stress. Similarly, the reported happiness score (3.0, Z-score -0.53) is below the mean, indicating higher subjective happiness, and the self-esteem score (-0.17 Z-score) is close to the population mean, suggesting a neutral to slightly below average self-worth, which typically correlates with lower stress. However, the STAI-Trait score of 42.0 (Z-score 0.07) falls into the 'anxious' classification and is slightly above the population mean, indicating a predisposition towards chronic anxiety, which can contribute to higher perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) indicates disturbed sleep, a common correlate of elevated stress.

Wearable data provide further insights into physiological regulation and behavioral patterns. The participant exhibits a relatively low Mesor (mean heart rate) of 62.62 (Z-score -1.55) and a resting heart rate of 50.3 (Z-score -0.93), both of which are notably lower than the population means. This suggests a more efficient cardiovascular system and potentially a more relaxed baseline physiological state. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals an Interdaily Stability (0.45, Z-score 0.33) that is slightly above the population mean, indicating some regularity in daily rhythms, yet the Intradaily Variability (0.63, Z-score 0.6) is also elevated, suggesting more fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which can be associated with increased stress. The hourly deviation from the Mesor analysis shows significant peaks in heart rate deviation during the late morning (9-10 AM: 19.76, Z-score 2.07; 10-11 AM: 19.79, Z-score 2.14) and the late afternoon (4-5 PM: 27.38, Z-score 2.76). These pronounced deviations suggest periods of elevated physiological arousal during these times, potentially in response to daily demands, which can contribute to perceived stress. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score 0.14), which is close to the population mean, but the Sleep Duration Standard Deviation (90 minutes, Z-score -0.25) suggests relatively consistent sleep duration. The median sleep start time is 00:31:16, with a standard deviation of 78 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent exercise alone (Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), which is a positive coping mechanism that may mitigate stress. However, the participant also reports spending significant time watching TV/Videos/Movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41), which are less active pursuits. Lower self-reported happiness is correlated with less reading and less socializing with friends, while higher trust is not significantly correlated with PSS.

In summation, the participant's data present a complex profile. The elevated STAI-Trait score and PSQI score, coupled with periods of significant physiological arousal during the workday, suggest potential contributors to perceived stress. However, lower depressive symptoms, higher self-reported happiness, and regular solitary exercise indicate protective factors. Considering the overall pattern, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean."
48013,"The participant's self-reported psychological measures and lifestyle habits suggest a profile associated with elevated perceived stress. Specifically, the scores on the CES-D (19.0, Z-score 0.59) and STAI-Trait (55.0, Z-score 1.35) indicate a notable burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively. These findings are further contextualized by a low score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (28.0, Z-Score -1.43) and a low self-reported happiness score (2.0, Z-Score -1.61). The participant's trust level is also significantly low (2.17, Z-Score -2.07), potentially reflecting interpersonal difficulties or a general sense of insecurity that could contribute to higher stress. These psychological indicators align with a higher perceived stress level.

In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant engages in regular exercise, both alone and with others (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more' for both), which might serve as a buffer against stress. However, certain daily recreation habits, such as extensive internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score 0.85) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-Score 1.13), could indicate avoidance or passive coping mechanisms, while a lack of engagement in reading (Z-Score -0.67) and sedentary hobbies (16-30 minutes, Z-Score 0.23) suggests a limited repertoire of potentially stress-reducing activities. Alcohol consumption is moderate to high (wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), which can be associated with stress management attempts.

The wearable-derived physiological and circadian rhythm data present a mixed picture. The participant exhibits relatively low interdaily stability (0.23, Z-Score -1.48) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.14, Z-Score -1.54), suggesting a less regular daily rhythm, which can be a marker of stress. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is also lower than the population average (7.44, Z-Score -1.08), which, in conjunction with a slightly elevated mesor (77.46, Z-Score 0.48) relative to the population mean, might indicate altered physiological regulation. The sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours (6 hours 56 minutes, Z-Score -0.31), which is close to the population average, but a higher standard deviation in sleep duration (151 minutes, Z-Score 1.13) and sleep start time (119 minutes, Z-Score 0.8) point towards sleep irregularity. Notably, the hourly heart rate deviations show pronounced peaks in arousal during the typical waking hours (e.g., 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM) and significant dips during the late night and early morning hours, consistent with a disturbed diurnal pattern. The PSQI score (7.0, Z-Score 0.13) indicating disturbed sleep, despite near-average sleep duration, further supports this.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by high anxiety, depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and low happiness, alongside evidence of a disrupted circadian rhythm and sleep irregularity, strongly suggests a **relatively high PSS score**. These factors are more indicative of perceived stress than are the positive aspects of their exercise habits.

The population mean PSS score is 21.61. Given the constellation of self-report measures (elevated anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and happiness) and physiological irregularities, it is inferred that the participant's overall perceived stress level is **above the population mean**."
14571,"The participant demonstrates a psychological profile characterized by low levels of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with high self-esteem and trust in others. Specifically, their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) are significantly below the population mean, indicating a disposition towards lower trait anxiety and minimal recent depressive symptomatology. This is further supported by a high score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, suggesting a robust sense of self-worth. Additionally, the participant reports a high level of trust in others, with a Z-score indicating a favorable position relative to the study population. These self-reported measures collectively suggest a psychological foundation of resilience and well-being, likely contributing to lower perceived stress.

In terms of lifestyle and behavior, the participant exhibits generally positive health indicators. Their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score suggests good subjective sleep quality, and their Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.79 falls within the underweight range, though this should be interpreted cautiously without further contextual information. Notably, the participant abstains from alcohol and recreational drug use, with only infrequent use of wine or liquor, and does not use non-prescribed drugs. Their engagement in structured physical activity is limited, with low frequencies reported for exercising alone, with others, and in sports. However, their daily recreational habits reveal a significant commitment to passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, general internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, all exceeding four hours daily. A notable exception is reading, which is engaged in for a shorter duration of 16-30 minutes daily. While the extensive engagement in sedentary leisure activities may warrant attention, the absence of substance use and generally good self-reported health and mental well-being indicators suggest a foundation that might buffer against heightened perceived stress.

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal a well-structured circadian rhythm, indicative of regularity in daily biological processes. The high Interdaily Stability (Z-score of 2.4) and the moderate Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of 2.24) suggest a consistent daily pattern in heart rate, which is often associated with lower stress levels. Conversely, the low Intradaily Variability (Z-score of -2.29) indicates less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which in the context of a healthy Mesor and Amplitude, can be interpreted as physiological stability. The Mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is elevated relative to the population mean, suggesting a potentially higher baseline cardiovascular tone. The Amplitude is also elevated, indicating a larger daily variation from this Mesor, which could reflect physiological reactivity. The Acrophase, or peak of the rhythm, is reported in the late afternoon (4:51 PM). The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes, which is close to the population average, and a relatively low standard deviation in sleep duration, suggesting consistent sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is in the early morning hours, with moderate variability. Taken together, the physiological data suggest a robust and regular circadian system, with some indicators of heightened cardiovascular activation but generally stable sleep patterns.

Considering the comprehensive analysis of self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be below the population mean. The low scores in anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, and high trust in others are strong indicators of psychological resilience. While the participant engages in extensive sedentary recreational activities, this is juxtaposed with a lack of substance use and good sleep quality. Furthermore, the physiological data points towards a stable circadian rhythm and consistent sleep duration, which are generally associated with lower stress. The elevated Mesor and Amplitude could suggest a higher physiological reactivity, but in the absence of supporting negative self-report measures, these might reflect an energetic baseline rather than distress. The overall constellation of data suggests a participant who is psychologically robust and maintains regular physiological patterns, leading to an inference of lower perceived stress relative to the study cohort."
69057,"The participant's psychological profile indicates a potentially elevated level of perceived stress, placing them above the population mean PSS score. This inference is supported by several factors. The participant reports higher than average trait anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 53.0, which is 1.16 standard deviations above the mean. While depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 12.0) are not notably elevated and self-esteem is within the average range, the elevated anxiety is a significant correlate of increased stress perception. Subjective sleep quality is also a concern, with a PSQI score of 7.0 suggesting disturbed sleep, which aligns with a higher PSS.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of social activity and listening to music, but notably abstains from reading and video games, activities that might serve as stress-reducing or engaging pastimes. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine or liquor, is reported at a frequency of 1-2 times a month, which is slightly above the population average based on the provided Z-scores. This pattern of reduced engagement in certain leisure activities, coupled with higher trait anxiety and disturbed sleep, suggests a profile conducive to elevated perceived stress.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate of 43.6 bpm, which is 1.73 standard deviations below the mean. This could reflect good cardiovascular fitness or potentially a parasympathetic-dominant state at rest. However, the circadian rhythm metrics suggest some irregularities. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (0.32), indicating less regularity in daily patterns, and the intradaily variability is higher than average (0.6), suggesting more fluctuation within a 24-hour period. The mesor, representing the average heart rate over the day, is also significantly low (-2.19 standard deviations), but this should be interpreted with caution given the lower resting heart rate. During the evening hours, specifically between 5-6 PM, there is a notable peak in heart rate deviation from the mesor (22.77), which is 1.79 standard deviations above the mean. This late afternoon/early evening elevation in physiological arousal, when combined with the other indicators, may contribute to the overall perception of stress. Sleep duration is also a significant concern, with a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 35 minutes, which is 1.99 standard deviations below the population mean, further reinforcing the impression of a stressed state.

In summary, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by elevated trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep quality, alongside objectively short sleep durations and certain behavioral patterns, suggests a state of elevated perceived stress. While some physiological markers like resting heart rate are low, the lack of regularity in daily heart rate patterns and the distinct arousal spike in the late afternoon/early evening contribute to the overall interpretation of a higher perceived stress level. The participant's overall perceived stress level is inferred to be **above the population mean**."
64232,"The participant exhibits a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is likely above the population mean. This inference is supported by several indicators within the provided dataset, suggesting a state of heightened perceived stress. Notably, the participant reports disturbed sleep, as indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59), which is above the commonly used threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Furthermore, the STAI Trait Anxiety inventory score of 44.0 (Z-score: 0.27) suggests a proneness to chronic anxiety, which is often associated with elevated perceived stress. Behavioral data reveals lower than average engagement in solitary exercise (Z-score: 0.32) and sports (Z-score: 1.58), alongside a higher than average consumption of beer (Z-score: 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score: 0.94), which could be indicative of coping mechanisms for stress. Additionally, the participant engages in recreational drug use 1-2 times a month (Z-score: 3.52), which is significantly higher than the population average and may be linked to stress management behaviors.

Conversely, certain data points suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress or are not strongly correlated with higher PSS. The participant's self-reported happiness is below average (Current happiness Z-score: -0.53), and they do not engage in activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -1.25) or reading (Z-score: -0.67), suggesting a potential lack of engagement in passive relaxation activities. Health satisfaction is near the population mean (Z-score: -0.03), and their Body Mass Index (21.85) falls within a healthy range. The participant's sleep duration is relatively consistent and above average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 1.01), although the standard deviation for sleep start time is notably high (Z-score: 1.48), indicating variability in sleep onset. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-score: -1.56), suggesting a less regular circadian rhythm in heart rate, which can sometimes be associated with stress but is not a definitive indicator in isolation. The mesor of the heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.46), but this is a general indicator of overall heart rate level and does not directly imply heightened stress without considering other factors.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the indicators of disturbed sleep, higher trait anxiety, and patterns of substance use and lower engagement in solitary physical activities collectively suggest that this participant likely experiences a perceived stress level that is above the population mean of 21.6. While some metrics indicate a healthy physiological baseline and engagement in certain social activities, the confluence of psychological and behavioral factors points towards a heightened stress experience."
37404,"The participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the provided data, appears to be slightly **above the population mean**. This assessment is based on a synthesis of self-report survey data, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics.

Several indicators suggest a higher perceived stress level. The participant exhibits a **high intradaily variability** (Z-score: 1.37) in their heart rate, signifying less stable physiological patterns throughout the day. This is further supported by a low **interdaily stability** (Z-score: -1.56) and low **autocorrelation at 24 hours** (Z-score: -1.54), suggesting a less regular daily rhythm. The **amplitude of the circadian rhythm** is also notably low (Z-score: -1.54), which can be associated with reduced responsiveness to daily environmental cues and potentially higher stress. The participant's **average sleep duration** is near the population mean (Z-score: -0.04), but the **standard deviation of sleep duration** is relatively low (Z-score: -0.78), suggesting consistent but potentially insufficient sleep. Furthermore, the participant engages in moderate weekly consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score: 0.94), which can sometimes be a coping mechanism associated with higher stress. They also report exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07), which, while beneficial, in combination with other factors, might represent an effort to manage stress.

Conversely, several factors do not strongly indicate high perceived stress. The participant reports **low levels of depressive symptoms** (CES-D Z-score: -0.66) and **low levels of trait anxiety** (STAI Z-score: -0.62). Their **self-esteem** is at the population average (SelfEsteem Z-Score: -0.03), and they report **high happiness levels** (Happy Z-Score: -0.53). Health satisfaction is also near the population average (Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.13). Regarding sleep start times, the median sleep start time is around midnight (00:48:47), and the standard deviation is moderate (Z-score: -0.39), suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule. Most recreational activities, such as watching TV, video games, and internet usage, are reported for durations that are lower than average, indicating less passive leisure time. The participant also reports no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

In conclusion, while the participant reports generally positive psychological states such as low depression, low anxiety, and high happiness, the physiological and behavioral metrics, particularly those related to circadian rhythm stability and variability, coupled with moderate substance use, suggest a higher level of perceived stress that is likely above the study population mean (Population PSS Mean: 21.62). The observed patterns of physiological irregularity may reflect a response to or a contributor to this elevated stress."
70492,"The participant's psychological profile indicates elevated levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are often associated with higher perceived stress. Specifically, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 49.0 and a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 16.0 place the participant in the anxious and depressed classifications, respectively. These scores are above the population mean for these measures, suggesting a tendency towards heightened emotional distress. Correspondingly, the STAI score shows a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress. Conversely, the participant reports relatively higher self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 34.0, Z-score of -0.59) and a slightly higher current happiness score (4.0, Z-score of 0.55), which might act as protective factors against stress, though these factors demonstrate weaker negative correlations with perceived stress. The participant's subjective sleep quality, as indicated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, suggests disturbed sleep, which aligns with the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" and is often co-occurring with elevated stress.

Behavioral data reveals a pattern of moderate substance use, with beer consumption occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 1.01), and less frequent use of wine/liquor and recreational drugs. Exercise habits are infrequent, with the participant exercising alone less than 1-2 times a month and engaging in sports not at all, but some engagement in exercising with others (1-2 times a month). Daily recreation habits include substantial internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.67), alongside significant time spent socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95). Sedentary hobbies are also reported as occupying 1-2 hours daily (Z-score of 1.41). Notably, reading is not a reported activity. While most of these behaviors show minimal to weak correlations with perceived stress, the higher Z-scores for internet usage, listening to music, and socializing suggest these activities are relatively frequent for this individual.

Physiological data from the wearable device indicates a lower than average mesor (mean heart rate of 69.52, Z-score of -0.6) and a relatively low resting heart rate (53.6, Z-score of -0.54). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals notable variability in heart rate during the early morning hours (3-6 AM), with significant negative deviations from the mesor, suggesting periods of very low cardiovascular activity during these times. This is particularly pronounced between 4-5 AM (deviation of -10.96, Z-score of 1.18) and 5-6 AM (deviation of -13.65, Z-score of 0.68). The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is close to average (Z-score of -0.13). However, the sleep duration standard deviation (2.75) and sleep start time standard deviation (1.21) are notably elevated, suggesting significant day-to-day variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is very late, at 03:03:40. This irregularity in sleep timing and duration, coupled with the significant deviations in heart rate during early morning hours, likely contributes to perceived stress. The overall pattern of physiological data, particularly the sleep irregularities and the pronounced dips in heart rate during the early morning, may indicate a disrupted circadian rhythm that could be associated with higher stress levels.

Considering all available data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean. This inference is primarily supported by the elevated scores in anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as the classification of disturbed sleep. While some protective factors like higher self-esteem are present, they do not seem to fully mitigate the impact of anxiety and depressive symptomology and disturbed sleep. The behavioral patterns, though not strongly correlated with stress, do not indicate significant stress-reducing activities such as regular exercise. The physiological data points to significant irregularity in sleep timing and duration, which is a known contributor to increased stress. The population mean PSS score is 21.61, with a 50th percentile of 22.0, suggesting that a score of 22 or higher is at or above the median. Given the constellation of factors suggesting heightened distress, it is reasonable to infer that the participant’s perceived stress level likely falls above the population mean."
95543,"The participant's self-reported Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, though not explicitly provided, can be inferred from the accompanying data. The participant exhibits several indicators associated with potentially lower perceived stress. They report low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 1.0, Z-score of -1.28) and low chronic anxiety (STAI score of 23.0, Z-score of -1.81), both of which correlate positively with higher PSS scores. Furthermore, their subjective sleep quality is assessed as good (PSQI score of 3.0, Z-score of -1.72), and they report high self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 49.0, Z-score of 1.52) and happiness (Happy current score of 5.0, Z-score of 1.64). These favorable psychological and subjective well-being measures suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level. Behaviorally, the participant abstains from all forms of substance usage and engages in exercise with others three times a week or more, a pattern that may contribute to lower stress.

Conversely, certain physiological and behavioral metrics might indicate potential areas of stress or disruption. The participant's higher-than-average Mesor (82.9, Z-score of 1.22) and resting heart rate (66.7, Z-score of 1.02) suggest a generally elevated physiological baseline. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals notable deviations from the mesor during evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7 PM and 10 PM, with the largest positive deviation occurring between 8 PM and 9 PM (21.48, Z-score of 2.09). This pattern could indicate increased physiological arousal during these times. Additionally, the participant's sleep patterns show some variability, with a median sleep start time around 2:25 AM and a standard deviation of 34 minutes, suggesting less regularity in sleep timing. The autocorrelation at 24 hours for heart rate is also higher than the population mean (0.51, Z-score of 1.57), indicating less regularity in daily rhythmicity. While the participant engages in moderate daily recreation like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage for 1-2 hours, they report minimal engagement in reading (15 minutes or less) and sedentary hobbies (16-30 minutes), and do not engage in listening to music.

Overall, when considering the constellation of self-reported psychological well-being, behavioral habits, and physiological data, the participant appears to experience a perceived stress level that is likely **below the population mean** for this study sample. The strong indicators of positive psychological states (low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness) and good subjective sleep quality, in conjunction with healthy lifestyle choices such as abstaining from substance use and exercising with others, outweigh the observed physiological patterns of elevated heart rate and some sleep irregularity. The latter might be contributing factors to stress, but the overall evidence leans towards a lower perceived stress experience."
67106,"The analysis of the provided data suggests a participant experiencing a PSS score that is likely above the population mean. This inference is supported by several behavioral and physiological indicators that correlate with higher perceived stress. Notably, the participant exhibits relatively low self-reported happiness (Z-score of 1.64 above the mean) and lower satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score of 1.47 above the mean). Furthermore, the individual's daily routine displays notably low engagement in social activities with friends, with an extremely low time spent (15 minutes or less) and a highly negative Z-score of -2.2. This pattern of reduced social interaction can be indicative of avoidance behaviors often associated with elevated stress.

In contrast, several factors suggest a lower perceived stress level or a resilience to stressors. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.18) and anxiety (STAI Z-score of -1.22), indicating a generally stable psychological state. Self-esteem scores are above average (Z-score of 1.1), and trust in others is also relatively high (Z-score of 0.83), which are typically associated with better psychological well-being. Sleep duration, while slightly below the median for the population (Z-score of -0.51 for median sleep duration), is not indicative of severe sleep disturbance, aligning with a PSQI score classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" but with a Z-score near the population mean (-0.33). The participant also engages in reading for a moderate duration (15 minutes or less, Z-score of 0.32), which can serve as a coping mechanism.

Wearable data reveals a robust circadian rhythm structure, as evidenced by high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.9) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 2.07). This indicates a predictable daily pattern. The Mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint) is near the population mean (Z-score of -0.21), and the resting heart rate is also slightly below the average (Z-score of -0.22), suggesting a relatively well-regulated physiological system. However, the aggregation of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of increased cardiovascular arousal during the late afternoon and evening, particularly between 6-7 PM (Z-score of 1.02) and 8-9 PM (Z-score of 1.21). These elevations, occurring later in the day, may coincide with increased perceived stress or rumination as the day concludes.

In conclusion, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. While possessing strong psychological resources such as high self-esteem and low trait anxiety, and a well-structured circadian rhythm, indicators such as low happiness, reduced social engagement, and elevated evening heart rate deviations suggest a PSS score that is likely above the population mean of 21.62. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**."
83612,"The participant's self-reported measures suggest a psychological profile that may be associated with elevated perceived stress. Notably, the participant reports high levels of trait anxiety as measured by the STAI (Score: 58.0, Z-score: 1.65), which is significantly above the population mean and classified as ""anxious."" This elevated anxiety is positively correlated with perceived stress (Score Correlation: 0.31). Furthermore, the participant's CES-D score (Score: 15.0, Z-score: 0.18) falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a modest positive correlation with perceived stress (Score Correlation: 0.28). Conversely, the participant exhibits relatively high self-esteem (Score: 29.0, Z-Score: -1.29) and self-reported happiness (Current: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55), both of which show a negative correlation with perceived stress (Score Correlations: -0.15 and -0.19, respectively), suggesting protective psychological factors may be present. Social trust (Score: 2.67, Z-Score: -1.1) and health satisfaction (Score: 4.22, Z-score: -0.03) are near or slightly below population averages, with negligible correlations to perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns indicate a moderate engagement in some health-promoting activities, but also sedentary habits. The participant exercises alone and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-Scores: 0.32 and 0.53, respectively), which are generally considered beneficial, though the correlation with perceived stress is weak. Engagement in sports is notably low (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-Score: -1.09). Regarding daily recreation, activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Time: '16-30 minutes', Z-Score: 0.01) and internet usage (Time: '1-2 hours', Z-Score: 0.18) are around the population mean. However, there is notably less time spent listening to music (Time: '15 minutes or less', Z-Score: -0.72), socializing with friends (Time: '31 minutes an hour', Z-Score: -0.62), and a complete absence of reading (Time: 'Do not do', Z-Score: -0.67) and video games (Time: 'Do not do', Z-Score: -0.56). These less engaged recreational activities have varied, mostly weak, correlations with perceived stress, with reading showing a slightly stronger negative correlation (Score Correlation: -0.21). Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is infrequent and near population averages, with recreational and non-prescribed drug use being not at all.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data reveal patterns that could be linked to perceived stress. The participant's sleep duration averages 6 hours and 42 minutes (Z-Score: -0.59), which is shorter than the population mean and shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress (Score Correlation: -0.04). Sleep regularity is moderate, with a standard deviation of sleep duration of 67 minutes (Z-Score: -0.76) and a sleep start time standard deviation of 84 minutes (Z-Score: 0.02). The overall circadian rhythm stability is below average, as indicated by a low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.28, Z-Score: -1.07) and high Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.7, Z-Score: 1.09), suggesting a less structured daily physiological rhythm. This reduced stability in daily rhythms is positively correlated with perceived stress (Score Correlation: 0.16). The mean heart rate (Mesor: 70.01, Z-Score: -0.54) and amplitude (Value: 9.31, Z-Score: -0.48) are slightly below population means, with the acrophase occurring in the late afternoon (4:23 PM). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates several periods of elevated physiological arousal, particularly during the late morning (8-9 AM, 9-10 AM), early afternoon (12-1 PM), late afternoon (4-5 PM), and evening (6-7 PM, 9-10 PM), with the 9-10 PM period showing the strongest positive deviation (Value: 15.67, Z-Score: 1.33) and a weak negative correlation with perceived stress (Score Correlation: -0.05). Conversely, the early morning hours show significant negative deviations from the mesor, reflecting lower arousal during sleep.

Considering the comprehensive analysis of self-reported, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. The significant elevation in trait anxiety, coupled with shorter sleep duration and less stable daily physiological rhythms, are strong indicators of potentially higher perceived stress. While high self-esteem and happiness may offer some buffer, the constellation of anxious tendencies and disrupted diurnal patterns points towards an overall elevated stress experience relative to the study population."
92566,"This individual's perceived stress level appears to be within the typical range of the study population. While specific Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores are not directly provided, the individual's self-reported psychological traits and behavioral patterns offer insights into their stress experience. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score of -0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 24.0, Z-score of -1.71). These scores suggest a lower proneness to experiencing distress. Furthermore, self-esteem is reported as relatively high (Score of 48.0, Z-Score of 1.38), which is typically associated with better stress coping mechanisms. A moderate level of overall happiness is also indicated (Z-Score of 1.64). Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score of 1.22). The PSQI score of 6.0, while falling within the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, is not markedly elevated (Z-Score of -0.33), suggesting that while sleep quality may not be optimal, it is not drastically divergent from the population mean. Trust in others is also reported at a near-average level (Z-Score of -0.46).

Several behavioral habits and physiological metrics also align with a potentially lower stress profile. The participant engages in regular exercise, specifically 'Exercised Alone' three times a week or more (Z-Score of 1.07). While recreational substance use is moderate (Beer: 1-2 times a month; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week), the use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement in reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 1.3) and substantial social interaction with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95), both of which are often protective factors against stress. The average daily sleep duration is approximately 6 hours and 17 minutes, which is below the recommended 7-9 hours but not extremely short (Z-Score of -1.11). The median sleep start time is around 12:49 AM, with a moderate standard deviation, indicating some variability in sleep timing but not an extreme irregularity. The mesor of the heart rate, a measure of average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is slightly below average (Z-Score of -0.35), as is the resting heart rate (Z-Score of -1.08), suggesting a potentially lower baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm metrics, including interdaily stability (Z-Score of -0.08) and intradaily variability (Z-Score of -0.18), are near the population mean, indicating a relatively regular daily rhythm.

However, there are some indicators that might suggest moments of heightened physiological response or potential stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals several periods of significant deviation from the mesor. Notably, between 2-5 AM, the mean heart rate deviates substantially below the mesor (Z-scores ranging from -1.51 to -1.77), which could reflect a deep sleep state or perhaps periods of reduced metabolic activity. Conversely, during waking hours, there are periods of increased heart rate deviation. For instance, between 6-7 PM, the heart rate deviates significantly above the mesor (Z-score of 1.35), and between 7-8 PM (Z-score of 0.8), and 4-5 PM (Z-score of 0.88). These peaks, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, could represent physiological responses to daily stressors or demanding activities. The standard deviations for sleep duration and sleep start time are slightly above average, suggesting some inconsistency in sleep patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours of heart rate (Z-Score of 0.56) is slightly above average, indicating a moderately consistent daily pattern in heart rate.

Considering the data holistically, the participant's low scores on anxiety and depression scales, coupled with relatively high self-esteem and proactive social engagement, suggest a general resilience to stress. The observed physiological deviations in heart rate, while present, do not appear to be overwhelmingly indicative of chronic high stress, particularly when viewed alongside the otherwise stable circadian rhythm metrics. The PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep, but this is not severely elevated. Therefore, it is inferred that the participant's overall perceived stress level is **near the mean** of the study population."
35987,"The participant exhibits a profile that suggests a perceived stress level that is likely at or slightly above the population mean. This inference is supported by several key indicators within the self-report and wearable data. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 51.0 (Z-score: 0.96) suggests a disposition towards higher levels of chronic anxiety, a trait often correlated with increased perceived stress. This is further corroborated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59), indicating disturbed sleep, which is a common consequence and contributor to elevated stress. While not directly measuring perceived stress, the CES-D score of 10.0 (not depressed) and a relatively high self-esteem score (28.0, Z-score: -1.43) may suggest resilience factors that could moderate stress levels. The participant also reports moderate beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01), which, while not inherently indicative of high stress, can sometimes be associated with coping mechanisms.

Conversely, certain metrics suggest potential buffers or lower stress indicators. The participant reports very low engagement in solitary exercise (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-score: -1.93) and exercise with others (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-score: -1.58), and sports (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-score: -1.09). Additionally, reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score: -0.67), suggesting limited engagement in potentially stress-reducing, solitary activities. Daily recreation habits show significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85), which are passive activities that may not actively mitigate stress. The participant's resting heart rate (57.2, Z-score: -0.11) is close to the population mean, and the health satisfaction score (3.0, Z-score: -0.95) is on the lower side, potentially reflecting unmet needs or concerns.

Analysis of the wearable data reveals a disrupted circadian rhythm and elevated physiological arousal during specific periods, which can be indicative of stress. The interdaily stability of heart rate is high (0.62, Z-score: 1.74), suggesting a consistent daily pattern, but this stability is coupled with a high intradaily variability (0.66, Z-score: 0.81), which can reflect periods of heightened physiological response throughout the day. Notably, the Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor shows significant positive deviations during evening and night hours, particularly between 9-10 PM (21.01, Z-score: 2.27) and 10-11 PM (16.08, Z-score: 1.52), and also late at night (11 PM-12 AM: 18.2, Z-score: 2.2). These elevated heart rate deviations during periods that should be associated with rest and recovery could signal heightened physiological arousal, potentially linked to stress. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score: -0.81) and a sleep start time deviation suggesting late sleep onset (Median: 02:45:29) align with the reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score). The mesor (78.05, Z-score: 0.56) is slightly above the population mean, and the amplitude (14.36, Z-score: 1.16) is also higher, indicating a greater daily fluctuation in heart rate.

Considering the population's PSS mean of 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68, this participant's data suggests a perceived stress level likely above the population mean. The presence of elevated anxiety traits, disturbed sleep, and periods of significantly increased physiological arousal during the night, despite some mitigating factors like relatively high self-esteem, collectively point towards a higher than average perceived stress burden during the academic semester."
79341,"**Perceived Stress and Associated Psychological and Behavioral Factors**

The participant's self-reported psychological state presents a mixed profile. They report moderate levels of anxiety as measured by the STAI (Trait Anxiety Score: 41.0, Z-score: -0.03), which is close to the population mean. While classified as ""anxious,"" this score falls within the average range for chronic anxiety proneness within the study sample. Similarly, their CES-D score (Score: 10.0, Z-score: -0.34) indicates a lack of significant depressive symptoms, falling below the population mean and suggesting a generally stable mood. Self-esteem is also within a typical range (Score: 39.0, Z-Score: 0.11), slightly above the average, with a low negative correlation to perceived stress. However, a notable finding is the exceptionally low score on the happiness measure (Current Happiness: 2.0, Z-Score: -1.61), significantly below the population mean, suggesting a subjective deficit in reported happiness that is moderately negatively correlated with perceived stress, potentially indicating that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also reported as average (Score: 3.89, Z-score: -0.28).

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral patterns, the participant exhibits a generally healthy profile with minimal substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs all report ""Not at all"" usage, with negative Z-scores indicating below-average usage compared to the population). Physical activity levels are relatively high, with regular exercise reported (""Three times a week or more"" for Exercised Alone, with a positive Z-score of 1.07), and moderate participation in exercising with others and sports. In terms of daily recreational habits, there is a high engagement in video games (Time: ""31 minutes an hour"", Z-Score: 1.71) and moderate time spent listening to music and socializing with friends. Conversely, sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and reading are reported at average or below-average levels, with reading time specifically reported as ""Do not do."" This pattern of moderate to high physical activity and varied recreational pursuits, with a notable exception for video gaming intensity, does not strongly correlate with perceived stress.

Physiological and sleep data reveal patterns that may indirectly relate to stress levels. The participant's circadian rhythm, assessed through heart rate variability, indicates good stability with an Interdaily Stability value of 0.52 (Z-Score: 0.91) and an Autocorrelation at 24 Hours value of 0.44 (Z-Score: 0.98), both suggesting a relatively structured daily pattern, though Intradaily Variability is slightly elevated (Value: 0.59, Z-Score: 0.32). The Mesor (Value: 64.24, Z-Score: -1.32) and Amplitude (Value: 10.19, Z-Score: -0.19) are below population averages, suggesting a lower baseline heart rate and less fluctuation. The reported Resting Heart Rate (Value: 48.25, Z-Score: -1.18) is also significantly below the population mean, indicating a generally lower physiological arousal state. Sleep duration is slightly below average (Median Sleep Duration: 6 hours 46 minutes, Z-Score: -0.51), and the sleep start time is consistently late (Median Sleep Start Time: 01:50:44), with a standard deviation that suggests some variability in sleep schedule. The PSQI score (Score: 5.0, Z-Score: -0.8) suggests good subjective sleep quality, falling below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance and indicating generally good sleep. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show increased positive deviations during midday (12 PM-3 PM) and early evening (5 PM-7 PM), with notable peaks around 12-1 PM (20.05, Z-Score: 1.87) and 1-2 PM (15.79, Z-Score: 1.27). Conversely, deeper negative deviations occur during early morning hours (3 AM-6 AM), consistent with sleep and recovery phases. These physiological patterns, particularly the lower resting heart rate and good sleep quality, may contribute to a lower perceived stress level.

Overall, the participant’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is inferred to be **near the mean** relative to the study population (Population PSS Mean: 21.63). While the participant reports below-average happiness, this is counterbalanced by a lack of significant depressive symptoms, average anxiety levels, good sleep quality, and a physiologically lower-arousal state indicated by heart rate metrics. The healthy lifestyle choices regarding substance use and physical activity, alongside generally regular circadian rhythms, further suggest a moderate overall stress experience. The high engagement in video games is the most prominent behavioral pattern that deviates from typical sedentary or less stimulating activities, and it shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress. The significant negative correlation between happiness and perceived stress suggests that while other factors are indicative of moderate stress, the participant's subjective experience of low happiness may be a more salient indicator of their perceived stress level, even if the overall score aligns with the population average."
83536,"The participant exhibits a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that appears to be around the population mean, with an inferred PSS of approximately 21.62, which aligns precisely with the study's population mean of 21.62. Several factors contribute to this balanced assessment. On the one hand, certain physiological and behavioral patterns suggest a lower perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.97) and low chronic anxiety proneness (STAI score of 26.0, Z-score of -1.51), both of which correlate positively, though weakly, with PSS. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (41.0, Z-score of 0.4) and relatively high happiness (5.0, Z-score of 1.64), with happiness showing a weak negative correlation with PSS, aligning with a lower stress profile. In terms of daily habits, the participant engages in moderate listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score of 2.06) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95), which may serve as stress buffering activities. Physiologically, the mesor (74.23, Z-score of 0.04) and amplitude (10.55, Z-score of -0.07) of the heart rate circadian rhythm are close to the population averages. Sleep duration is also near the population mean (median 7 hours 5 minutes, Z-score of -0.13).

Conversely, other data points suggest a slightly elevated stress level or potential for stress. The participant's sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-score of -0.33), falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, suggesting subjective difficulties with sleep, which is often associated with higher stress. The intradaily variability of the heart rate circadian rhythm (0.65, Z-score of 0.74) is higher than the population mean, indicating less regularity in daily heart rate fluctuations, which can be a marker of physiological stress. Examining the aggregated hourly heart rate data, there are periods of notable deviation from the mesor. Specifically, the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM with a deviation of -14.57, Z-score of 0.28; 4-5 AM with -20.41, Z-score of -0.38; 5-6 AM with -22.99, Z-score of -0.67; 6-7 AM with -23.37, Z-score of -0.84) show significant negative deviations from the mesor, potentially reflecting periods of physiological disquiet or suppressed arousal relative to the daily average. In contrast, the afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 12-1 PM with 14.39, Z-score of 0.89; 7-8 PM with 14.46, Z-score of 0.51; 9-10 PM with 11.29, Z-score of 0.56) exhibit positive deviations, indicating periods of higher cardiovascular activity. While these deviations are not consistently correlated with PSS, the overall pattern of disturbed sleep and higher intradaily variability warrants consideration in the context of stress. The participant's academic performance, as reflected in GPA (most recently 3.5 in Fall 2016), while good, is not exceptionally high relative to other academic metrics, and does not strongly correlate with PSS. Overall, the confluence of generally positive psychological indicators and moderate academic performance, balanced against disturbed sleep and some physiological irregularities, positions the participant's perceived stress level near the population mean for the study sample."
67608,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with indicators that suggest both potentially higher and lower perceived stress. On the side of potentially higher perceived stress, the participant reports a PSQI score of 7.0, which, while only slightly above the population mean for this metric, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This, coupled with a significant positive Z-score of 1.58 for Intradaily Variability (indicating less regularity in daily activity patterns) and a positive Z-score of 0.61 for Mean Daily Naps, could point to a lifestyle that is less structured, potentially contributing to stress. Furthermore, several hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show notable positive deviations, particularly between 8-9 PM (Z-score 2.32) and 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.49), suggesting periods of heightened physiological arousal during these evening hours, which may correlate with perceived stress. The Z-score for 'Exercised Alone' is also relatively high (1.07), indicating a frequency of solitary exercise that could be indicative of a coping mechanism or a lack of social engagement, though the correlation with PSS is negligible.

Conversely, several factors suggest a lower level of perceived stress. The participant's self-reported anxiety (STAI) and depressive symptoms (CESD) are notably low, with significant negative Z-scores of -1.51 and -1.28 respectively, indicating a low proneness to chronic anxiety and minimal recent depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is above average, with a Z-score of 0.96, and self-reported happiness is also high, with a Z-score of 1.64, both negatively correlated with PSS scores. The participant maintains a consistently high GPA (3.8-4.0), and a low Z-score for Internet Usage (0.18) alongside minimal time spent on passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25) and reading (Z-score -0.67) suggests engaged and productive daily routines, which are generally associated with lower stress. The participant also reports very low engagement in social activities with friends (Z-score -2.2), which, while potentially linked to other factors, does not directly correlate strongly with PSS in this dataset. The Mesor (average heart rate) is below the population mean, and the Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also slightly below average, suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate, which can be a marker of healthier physiological regulation. The median sleep duration is close to the population average, and the standard deviation for sleep duration and sleep start time are within acceptable ranges, though the median sleep start time is quite late.

Overall, this participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, appears to be near the population mean for PSS. While there are indicators of disturbed sleep and some evening physiological arousal, these are substantially outweighed by robust self-reported measures of low anxiety, depression, high self-esteem, and happiness, as well as evidence of high academic performance and engagement in certain activities. The strong positive correlations of low anxiety, low depression, high self-esteem, and high happiness with lower perceived stress, and their prominent scores in this participant, suggest a relatively resilient psychological profile that buffers against higher stress levels, placing their overall perceived stress near the population average."
19735,"The participant exhibits several indicators potentially associated with elevated perceived stress. Notably, a high score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Score: 34.0, Z-score: 2.15) classifies them as experiencing a significant burden of depressive symptoms, which correlates positively with perceived stress (r = 0.29). Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 47.0 (Z-score: 0.56) suggests a tendency towards higher chronic anxiety proneness (r = 0.31). In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports using recreational drugs 1-2 times a month (Z-Score: 3.52), which is a notably higher frequency compared to the population. Furthermore, their engagement in exercising with others is infrequent (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-Score: -1.58), and they spend minimal time socializing with friends (Time: '15 minutes or less', Z-Score: -2.2). The wearable data reveals pronounced deviations in heart rate during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM, with values significantly below the mesor (Z-scores of -0.99 and -1.24 respectively), suggesting a potentially disrupted physiological state during this period. There is also a higher than average deviation from the mesor between 12-1 AM (Z-score: 1.07) and 11 AM - 12 PM (Z-score: 1.3), indicating periods of higher physiological arousal or activity relative to their typical daily rhythm during these times. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Value: 14.29, Z-Score: 1.13) is also elevated, indicating a greater range in heart rate variability throughout the day.

Conversely, certain metrics suggest factors that might be associated with lower perceived stress. The participant's Self-Esteem score is relatively low (Score: 31.0, Z-Score: -1.01), which correlates negatively with perceived stress (r = -0.16), implying that higher self-esteem might be linked to lower stress. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 (Z-Score: -0.33) indicates disturbed sleep, it is not significantly extreme relative to the population. Their reported happiness level is also below average (Current: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53), correlating negatively with perceived stress (r = -0.19). The participant also reports exercising alone 1-2 times a week (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z-Score: 0.32). Their resting heart rate is also relatively low (Value: 50.3, Z-Score: -0.93), which is generally considered a positive physiological indicator. Sleep duration is above average (Median Sleep Duration: '7 hours 48 minutes', Z-Score: 0.77).

Considering the constellation of these findings, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. The pronounced depressive symptomatology, elevated anxiety proneness, significant recreational drug use, reduced social engagement, and notable disruptions in heart rate during early morning hours collectively point towards a higher stress experience. While some physiological markers like resting heart rate and median sleep duration are favorable, they are overshadowed by the indicators of psychological distress and potentially disrupted circadian regulation. The high CES-D and STAI scores, in particular, are strong contributors to inferring a higher perceived stress level, aligning with the population's mean PSS score."
59207,"The participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is **above the population mean**. This inference is supported by several indicators within the provided dataset, particularly concerning sleep patterns and physiological regulation. The median sleep duration is notably longer than the population average, as indicated by a positive Z-score of 1.28, and the standard deviation of sleep duration is also significantly elevated (Z-score of 1.55). Similarly, the standard deviation of sleep start time is high (Z-score of 1.27), suggesting irregularity in sleep scheduling. These metrics, when viewed collectively, point towards potentially disrupted or inconsistent sleep hygiene, which is often associated with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits a high PSQI score (8.0, Z-score of 0.59), classifying their sleep quality as disturbed, which aligns with the observed sleep duration and timing variability.

In contrast, several factors suggest a lower perceived stress profile. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 10.0, Z-score of -0.34) and a classification of ""not anxious"" on the STAI trait scale (score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.43). Self-esteem is within a typical range, and general happiness is reported at a level that is slightly below the population average (Z-score of -0.53). Physically, their Body Mass Index falls within a healthy range, and their reported health satisfaction is relatively high (Z-score of 1.3). Behavioral patterns also present a mixed picture; while video game usage is notably high (Z-score of 2.47), other sedentary activities like watching TV and internet usage are also elevated. Exercise frequency, particularly alone and with others, and participation in sports are also at a moderate to high level.

However, the physiological data from the wearable device offers a more nuanced perspective that leans towards elevated stress. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z-score of 1.24), suggesting a less predictable daily rhythm, while intradaily variability is significantly low (Z-score of -2.08), indicating a lack of dynamic heart rate fluctuations throughout the day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also elevated (Z-score of 1.05), and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon, potentially reflecting a less robust diurnal variation in cardiovascular activity. The mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly elevated above the population mean (Z-score of 0.34). While many hourly deviations from the mesor are within a typical range, several evening and late-night hours show significant positive deviations (e.g., 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal during times when one might expect relaxation. These physiological markers, especially the disrupted rhythmicity and elevated evening arousal, combined with the observed sleep irregularities, are more indicative of a heightened stress response despite relatively low self-reported anxiety and depression. The positive correlations between PSS score and sleep disruption metrics (sleep duration standard deviation, sleep start time standard deviation) and negative correlations with measures of positive well-being (reading time, general happiness) further reinforce this conclusion."
96613,"The analysis of the provided multimodal data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean for perceived stress. This inference is primarily supported by several physiological and behavioral indicators. The participant exhibits a notably higher amplitude in their heart rate circadian rhythm (Z-score of 1.26), indicating a wider swing between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. This is accompanied by higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score of 0.67), which can be indicative of physiological reactivity and potentially increased stress responses. Furthermore, the participant reports exercising with others more frequently than the population average (Z-score of 1.23), and engages in more sedentary hobbies for extended periods (Z-score of 1.41), including significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games. These behavioral patterns, coupled with a lower than average resting heart rate (Z-score of -1.23) and a less structured circadian rhythm as indicated by lower interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.33), suggest a potentially disrupted physiological and behavioral regulation, which are often associated with elevated stress.

Conversely, certain data points suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively high level of happiness (Z-score of -0.53, indicating they are happier than the average participant) and has a positive perception of their health satisfaction (Z-score of 1.05). Their CES-D score is low (Z-score of -0.66), indicating minimal depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score suggests a low propensity for chronic anxiety (Z-score of -0.72). They also report below average beer consumption (Z-score of 1.01) and do not engage with recreational or non-prescribed drugs. The sleep duration is also notably higher than average (Z-score of 1.61), and the sleep start time is more consistent (Z-score of -1.06), which could contribute to lower stress. The participant also demonstrates a higher level of trust (Z-score of 0.5).

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns. There are significantly elevated deviations from the mesor during the afternoon and evening hours, specifically between 2-3 PM (Z-score of 2.21), 3-4 PM (Z-score of 2.02), 8-9 PM (Z-score of 1.49), and 9-10 PM (Z-score of 1.43). These periods of increased heart rate deviation, relative to their individual average, could reflect heightened physiological arousal during specific times of the day, potentially linked to daily activities or stressors. Conversely, the early morning hours, particularly between 3 AM and 7 AM, show the most pronounced negative deviations, suggesting periods of significantly lower heart rate during these times, which is consistent with sleep.

In conclusion, while the participant exhibits several positive indicators such as high happiness, low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, and adequate sleep duration, the overall pattern of physiological arousal (high amplitude and intradaily variability in heart rate) and certain behavioral habits (extensive sedentary activities) strongly suggests a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. The elevated heart rate deviations during specific afternoon and evening hours further support the inference of heightened physiological responses, potentially indicative of stress, despite other reported well-being metrics."
50766,"The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. This inference is supported by several behavioral and physiological indicators. Notably, the participant's self-reported happiness is low (Z-score of -0.53), and they report frequent alcohol consumption, with beer usage occurring ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score of 1.01). Furthermore, the PSQI score of 7.0 suggests disturbed sleep, which is often linked to elevated stress. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a high amplitude in their heart rate (Z-score of 1.63), suggesting significant fluctuation in cardiovascular arousal throughout the day. This is further evidenced by pronounced deviations from the mesor, particularly during the afternoon (3-4 PM: Z-score of 2.58) and early evening (6-7 PM: Z-score of 1.43; 7-8 PM: Z-score of 1.35). The high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of 1.57) of heart rate, combined with a relatively high mesor (Z-score of 0.66), indicate a consistent but potentially heightened baseline physiological activation.

Conversely, some data points suggest potential resilience or lower stress. The participant reports relatively low levels of trait anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score of -0.43) and depressive symptoms (CESD score of 11.0, Z-score of -0.24), which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-esteem score of 43.0 (Z-Score of 0.68) is also relatively high, indicating a positive self-regard. Regarding behaviors, the participant engages in social exercise ""three times a week or more"" (Z-Score of 1.23), which can be a stress buffer. While sleep duration is within a reasonable range (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 29 minutes, Z-Score of 0.37), the variability in sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 54 minutes, Z-Score of -0.63) indicates some inconsistency in sleep scheduling. Additionally, daily recreation habits are mixed, with limited time spent on video games, internet usage, and socialising with friends, while spending moderate time watching TV/videos and listening to music.

In summary, while the participant presents with indicators of lower psychological distress in terms of anxiety and depression, and demonstrates positive social behaviors like exercising with others, the pervasive physiological data reflecting heightened cardiovascular arousal and significant daily fluctuations, coupled with disturbed sleep and higher alcohol consumption, strongly suggest a higher overall perceived stress level. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely above the population mean of 21.62."
71089,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely falling near the population mean. Several self-report measures provide insight into this assessment. The participant reports a CES-D score of 16.0, indicating some level of depressive symptoms, with a positive correlation (0.28) to perceived stress. Similarly, the STAI score of 46.0 suggests proneness to anxiety, showing a positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress. Conversely, a higher self-esteem score (27.0, Z-score -1.57) and higher reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) are associated with lower perceived stress, indicated by their negative correlations (-0.16 and -0.19, respectively). Health satisfaction also appears to be a protective factor, with a lower score (2.33, Z-score -1.45) correlating negatively (-0.08) with perceived stress, suggesting that lower satisfaction with physical health might be associated with lower perceived stress. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as disturbed (Score 6.0, Z-score -0.33), which often correlates with higher stress, though its correlation with perceived stress is neutral (-0.04).

Regarding behavioral patterns, the participant engages in moderate levels of passive leisure activities. Specifically, daily internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and listening to music (Z-score 1.6) are notably high, while time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41) are also significant. Video game usage is also at a higher than average level (Z-score 0.96). In contrast, the participant reports no engagement in exercising alone, with others, or in sports, as indicated by substantial negative Z-scores for these activities (-1.93, -1.58, and -1.09, respectively). Socializing with friends is reported at a moderate level (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95). Substance usage for beer and wine or liquor occurs approximately 1-2 times a month, with Z-scores slightly above average, while recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all.

Analysis of wearable data reveals a generally structured but somewhat elevated physiological state. The participant exhibits a high Mesor (86.93, Z-score 1.77) and amplitude (13.35, Z-score 0.83) in their heart rate circadian rhythm, suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate and a higher average heart rate compared to the population. This elevated Mesor is further supported by a higher than average resting heart rate (71.2, Z-score 1.55). The interdaily stability (0.57, Z-score 1.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, Z-score 1.23) are also high, indicating a regular and predictable daily pattern in heart rate. However, intradaily variability (0.43, Z-score -0.81) is lower than average, suggesting a smoother within-day pattern of heart rate changes. Sleep statistics indicate a healthy median sleep duration (8 hours 12 minutes, Z-score 1.26) and a relatively stable sleep start time (standard deviation 39 minutes, Z-score -0.96), which generally contribute to lower perceived stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows notable deviations from the Mesor, with peak positive deviations occurring in the evening hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: 15.85, 8-9 PM: 13.52) and earlier morning hours (e.g., 5-6 AM: -16.85, 6-7 AM: -20.06). These deviations suggest periods of heightened cardiovascular activity, particularly in the evening.

In summary, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While the participant exhibits positive indicators such as good sleep duration and regularity in their circadian rhythm, and some protective psychological factors like moderate self-esteem and happiness, these are counterbalanced by indicators of potential stress, including elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, significant engagement in passive leisure activities, and a higher resting heart rate. The latter point is particularly relevant as a higher Mesor and Resting Heart Rate, combined with notable positive deviations in heart rate during evening hours, may reflect physiological responses associated with stress. The participant's GPA has shown a consistent upward trend across semesters, reaching 3.86 in Fall 2016, which is a positive indicator of academic functioning that may buffer stress."
22688,"The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a relatively high perceived stress level. Self-reported measures reveal a significant deviation from population norms in key areas related to psychological well-being. Specifically, the participant reports exceptionally high levels of happiness (Z-score = 1.64), which may suggest a disparity between their reported emotional state and underlying stress. Furthermore, health satisfaction is also notably high (Z-score = 1.22). These elevated positive self-assessments, in the context of other metrics, could potentially reflect a coping mechanism or an underestimation of stress.

In contrast, the participant's engagement in certain social and recreational activities aligns with patterns potentially indicative of lower stress. They report socializing with friends for 31 minutes to an hour daily (Z-score = -0.62), which is within the lower range compared to the population, but still represents a level of social engagement. Similarly, they report exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score = 1.23), which is an above-average frequency and a positive behavioral indicator. The participant also reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.94), which, while not necessarily indicative of stress, represents a common behavioral pattern. Importantly, the participant reported not using recreational or non-prescribed drugs, suggesting a lack of engagement in potentially stress-mitigating or stress-exacerbating substance use.

Analysis of wearable data provides further context for the participant's physiological and behavioral patterns. The participant demonstrates strong intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.8) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -1.79), suggesting a less regular and potentially disrupted daily rhythm. This pattern of low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.15) indicates a lack of consistent daily structure in their activity patterns, which is often associated with increased stress. Sleep statistics also show a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score = 1.05), which is above the population average, and a relatively low standard deviation for sleep duration (Z-score = -0.51), suggesting consistent sleep duration. However, the median sleep start time is late at 00:33:42, with a moderate standard deviation of 47 minutes, indicating some variability in sleep onset. The Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is near the population mean (Z-score = -0.01), suggesting no significant difference in overall resting heart rate. However, the mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals elevated heart rates during specific periods, particularly between 2 AM and 8 AM, with the largest positive deviations occurring between 8-9 AM (Z-score = 1.32) and 7-8 AM (Z-score = 1.03). This suggests a heightened physiological arousal during these morning hours, which could be linked to anticipated stressors or an awakening response.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the provided data, appears to be **near the population mean**. While the participant reports high levels of happiness and health satisfaction, which might typically correlate with lower stress, the indices of disrupted daily rhythm and elevated morning physiological arousal suggest underlying stress. The absence of significant negative self-reports on depression and anxiety scales, coupled with the high academic performance (GPA) and moderate engagement in social activities and exercise, moderate the interpretation towards the population average for perceived stress. The lack of clear, strong correlations between the PSS score and most individual metrics further supports this conclusion, suggesting a complex interplay of factors rather than a pronounced deviation."
38815,"The participant exhibits a complex profile that suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, potentially slightly above the population mean. Self-report measures indicate a tendency towards heightened anxiety, as reflected in a STAI-Trait score (43.0) that falls within the anxious classification. While not indicative of significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, classified as ""Not depressed""), the elevated anxiety proneness suggests a baseline susceptibility to stressors. Self-esteem is near neutral (RSES score of 38.0, Z-score -0.03), and current happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), which may serve as partial buffers against stress. However, a PSQI score of 7.0, falling above the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, indicates subjective sleep quality issues, which is frequently correlated with increased perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns reveal a mixed influence on perceived stress. The participant reports high engagement in internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and listening to music (Z-score 1.13) for considerable durations, potentially indicating a tendency towards passive or solitary leisure activities that may not actively mitigate stress. Conversely, engaging in sports (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-score -1.09) and exercising with others (Frequency: 'Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score -0.88) are notably low, suggesting a potential deficit in beneficial stress-reducing physical activities. Substance usage, specifically beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01), is higher than the population average, which may be a coping mechanism, though its direct impact on perceived stress is not strongly indicated by the provided correlation.

Physiological data from wearable devices paint a picture of a somewhat irregular circadian rhythm and potentially elevated physiological arousal at specific times of the day, which aligns with higher perceived stress. The low Interdaily Stability (Value 0.31, Z-score -0.82) and a Mesor (Value 65.92, Z-score -1.1) that is lower than the population average suggests a less robust daily rhythm. Notably, the Resting Heart Rate (Value 47.5, Z-score -1.27) is substantially lower than the population average, which might indicate good cardiovascular fitness but could also be interpreted in conjunction with other metrics. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show pronounced positive deviations during late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.06, and 6-7 PM with a Z-score of 1.65), indicating periods of significant physiological arousal that could be indicative of stress responses. Sleep statistics show a slight deviation in duration variability (Z-score 0.8), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns, which, coupled with the PSQI score, reinforces the notion of disturbed sleep. The PSS population mean is 21.61, with a median of 22.0. Based on the constellation of findings, particularly the elevated anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, and periods of heightened physiological arousal, the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely to be **above the population mean**."
72885,"The participant's overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the provided data, appears to be near the population mean. This is suggested by a balanced consideration of various indicators. On one hand, several factors point towards a potentially higher stress experience. The participant exhibits a high score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with a Z-score of 1.98, classifying their sleep quality as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This aligns with a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours, which is considerably below typical recommendations and has a Z-score of -1.5, indicating a significantly shorter duration than the study population. Furthermore, the STAI–Trait anxiety assessment yielded a score of 46.0 (Z-score: 0.46), classifying them as ""anxious,"" and the CES-D score of 15.0 (Z-score: 0.18) suggests a mild burden of depressive symptoms.

Conversely, several other metrics suggest a more moderate or lower stress profile. Self-reported happiness is relatively high, with a Z-score of 0.55. Self-esteem is also notably high, with a Z-score of -1.01, and trust in others is also above average, with a Z-score of -1.42. While the academic performance (GPA) shows a downward trend across the observed semesters, the most recent GPA of 2.77 does not necessarily indicate extreme academic distress in isolation. The participant's health satisfaction score of 3.56 (Z-score: -0.53) is also slightly below average, but not indicative of significant dissatisfaction. From a behavioral standpoint, substance usage, with the exception of recreational drugs (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 5.44), is infrequent. Exercise frequencies are generally low, particularly exercising with others and sports, which are rated as ""Not at all."" Recreational activities such as video games are engaged in for extended periods (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47).

The wearable-derived physiological data also present a mixed picture regarding stress. The interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Value: 0.25, Z-score: -1.32), suggesting some irregularity in daily rhythms, but the intradaily variability (Value: 0.52, Z-score: -0.18) is near the population mean. The mesor (Value: 68.55, Z-score: -0.74) and amplitude (Value: 7.68, Z-score: -1.0) of the circadian rhythm are below average, suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The acrophase occurring at 6:38 PM indicates a typical peak time for circadian rhythm. The mean aggregate deviations from the mesor show notable elevations in heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM) with Z-scores ranging from 1.13 to 2.04, which could indicate physiological responses to disturbed sleep or other factors during these times. However, other periods of the day show deviations closer to the mean. The resting heart rate of 54.4 (Z-score: -0.45) is also within a healthy range and below the population mean.

In summary, while the participant experiences significant sleep disturbance and elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, these are counterbalanced by high self-esteem, happiness, and trust, as well as a resting heart rate and overall circadian rhythm parameters that are not indicative of extreme physiological dysregulation. The academic performance trend, while noted, does not appear to be the sole driver of perceived stress. Therefore, the overall picture suggests a perceived stress level that is near the population mean for this study sample."
71193,"The participant exhibits a complex profile suggestive of moderate to high perceived stress, evidenced by several psychological and behavioral indicators. Self-reported measures indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 39.0, placing them in the ""Depressed"" classification and scoring 2.67 standard deviations above the mean of the study population. Similarly, trait anxiety is elevated, with an STAI score of 60.0, also classified as ""anxious"" and representing a Z-score of 1.85. These findings are consistent with a higher propensity for experiencing stress. Subjective well-being indicators also point to lower levels of psychological comfort; self-reported happiness is low with a Z-score of -1.61, and trust in others is also below average (Z-score of -1.42). These psychological factors, particularly elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, correlate positively with perceived stress, suggesting a significant contribution to a higher PSS score.

Behaviorally, several habits and physiological patterns further support the assessment of elevated perceived stress. The participant reports engaging in 1-2 hours of video gaming daily (Z-score of 2.47), a sedentary activity that may correlate with less adaptive coping mechanisms. Additionally, there is a notable lack of exercise, with ""Exercised with Others"" and ""Sports"" frequencies reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-scores of -1.58 and -1.09, respectively). While the participant does engage in some sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.41), the overall pattern suggests a lifestyle with limited opportunities for stress-reducing physical activity or active social engagement beyond socializing for approximately 31 minutes an hour. Sleep patterns, while not extremely disturbed in terms of duration (median duration of 8 hours 2 minutes, Z-score of 1.05), exhibit some variability, with a sleep duration standard deviation of 55 minutes (Z-score of -1.04). The median sleep start time is late at 1:47 AM, with a standard deviation of 41 minutes (Z-score of -0.93), indicating some irregularity in sleep timing. The PSQI score of 8.0 suggests disturbed sleep quality, scoring above the common threshold for clinical significance and having a Z-score of 0.59.

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data suggest a moderately disrupted internal timing system. Interdaily stability, a measure of daily rhythm regularity, is low with a value of 0.6 and a high Z-score of 1.57, indicating less consistent daily patterns. Conversely, intraday variability is relatively low (Z-score of -1.24), which might suggest a flatter diurnal heart rate profile. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (Z-score of 1.82), indicating strong day-to-day predictability, which could be interpreted as rigidity in the rhythm. The mesor, or average heart rate over the 24-hour period, is near the population mean (Z-score of 0.19). However, the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, the participant exhibits significantly higher heart rate deviations during the late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 2-3 PM with a Z-score of 2.28, 3-4 PM with a Z-score of 2.01), suggesting increased physiological activation during these periods. Conversely, there are pronounced dips in heart rate deviation during the late morning and early afternoon hours, particularly between 7 AM and 11 AM, indicating periods of lower than average cardiovascular activity relative to their daily rhythm.

In conclusion, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the comprehensive dataset, appears to be **above the population mean**. This inference is primarily driven by elevated self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with low self-reported happiness and trust. The behavioral patterns, characterized by sedentary habits and limited exercise, along with some evidence of sleep disturbance, further contribute to this assessment. While certain physiological measures like mesor and resting heart rate are within typical ranges, the disrupted interdaily stability and pronounced diurnal variations in heart rate deviations suggest underlying physiological dysregulation that likely exacerbates perceived stress. The combination of significant psychological distress and lifestyle factors points towards a state of heightened stress."
98760,"This analysis examines psychological and physiological data in relation to perceived stress (PSS). The participant's self-reported measures indicate a generally positive psychological profile, with scores for depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI-Trait) falling within classifications of ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Their self-esteem score is within the upper range of scores, suggesting good self-worth, and they report relatively high happiness levels, as indicated by a significant positive Z-score. Health satisfaction is also reported near the population average. Notably, the participant exhibits a high PSQI score, indicating disturbed sleep, and a lower than average Body Mass Index.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports abstaining from alcohol and recreational drug use. They engage in regular exercise alone, three times a week or more, which is above average. However, they do not exercise with others or participate in sports. Daily recreational activities are generally limited in duration, with particularly low reported internet usage and no engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is also reported for a relatively short duration. These habits, particularly the limited social interaction and engagement in passive leisure, could be indirectly related to stress management or social support networks.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a regular circadian rhythm characterized by a relatively low mesor, indicating a lower average heart rate. The amplitude is high, suggesting significant diurnal variation in heart rate, and the acrophase, the peak of the rhythm, occurs in the early evening. Interdaily stability is near the population average, suggesting moderate day-to-day consistency in activity patterns, while intradaily variability is somewhat higher than average, indicating more fluctuation in activity throughout the day. The participant's resting heart rate is below the population average. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns: significantly lower than average heart rate during late night and early morning hours (approximately 3 AM to 7 AM), followed by a gradual increase and then marked elevation in the late evening (6 PM to 10 PM), peaking significantly between 8 PM and 9 PM. This late-evening cardiovascular arousal, coupled with the reported disturbed sleep, suggests potential disruptions in the natural physiological recovery process.

Considering the provided data, the participant's self-reported psychological well-being is largely positive, which would typically correlate with lower perceived stress. However, the significantly disturbed sleep quality (high PSQI score) and the elevated heart rate during late evening hours, which deviate considerably from the mesor and are characteristic of arousal rather than rest, are likely indicators of heightened perceived stress. While correlations are provided as supplementary guidance, the holistic interpretation leans towards these physiological and sleep-related metrics as more indicative of stress than the generally positive self-report surveys for anxiety and depression.

Based on the provided population statistics for the Perceived Stress Scale (Mean: 21.62, 50th percentile: 22.0), and inferring from the participant's overall profile, particularly the disturbed sleep and late-evening physiological arousal, it is plausible that the participant's perceived stress level is **near the population mean**. The positive self-reports on anxiety and depression mitigate against a significantly higher PSS, while the sleep and cardiovascular data suggest a level of stress that prevents a score significantly below the average."
95374,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a profile indicative of elevated perceived stress. High scores on the CES-D (28.0, Z=1.53) and STAI-Trait (47.0, Z=0.56) scales indicate a notable burden of depressive symptoms and a proneness to chronic anxiety, respectively. These findings are consistent with a higher perceived stress level, as evidenced by positive correlations with PSS scores for both measures (CES-D: 0.29, STAI: 0.31). Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score (9.0, Z=1.05), which is a common correlate of increased stress. Self-reported happiness is also notably low (2.0, Z=-1.61), with a negative correlation to PSS (-0.19), further reinforcing the impression of psychological distress. These self-reported measures collectively point towards an individual experiencing significant internal strain, likely contributing to a higher perceived stress level.

In contrast, certain lifestyle and behavioral factors do not strongly suggest heightened stress. The participant reports no substance usage (Beer, Wine/Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs) and no engagement in regular exercise, either alone or with others, or in sports. While these behaviors might be expected in lower stress contexts, their absence does not strongly mitigate the psychological indicators of stress. Similarly, the participant engages in moderate to high levels of recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28), playing video games (1-2 hours, Z=2.47), and socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z=1.74), and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z=0.67). These activities, particularly significant time spent socializing, could offer a buffer against stress, though the high engagement in video games, which has a notable positive Z-score, warrants consideration. Nevertheless, the absence of negative lifestyle behaviors does not outweigh the substantial indicators of psychological distress.

The wearable data presents a complex picture, with some metrics aligning with higher stress and others with lower stress, but with an overall trend that suggests a disrupted physiological rhythm. The significantly high Amplitude of the heart rate cosinor analysis (Value: 17.15, Z=2.06) indicates a large fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which can be indicative of physiological reactivity. Furthermore, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals pronounced deviations from the mesor, particularly during the evening and late-night hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: 31.09, Z=3.42; 10-11 PM: 18.54, Z=1.91). This pattern suggests a heightened physiological response during periods typically associated with winding down. Sleep statistics reveal a markedly high standard deviation in sleep duration (Value: 219 minutes, Z=2.68) and sleep start time (Value: 148 minutes, Z=1.43), indicating considerable irregularity in sleep patterns. This sleep irregularity is a significant indicator of potential stress impacting recovery and homeostasis, and it is positively correlated with PSS (Sleep Duration SD: 0.15, Sleep Start Time SD: 0.18). Conversely, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (Value: 51.4, Z=-0.8) and a mesor that is below the population mean (Value: 71.57, Z=-0.32), which might typically be associated with lower stress. However, the overall pattern of elevated heart rate variability during specific hours, coupled with highly irregular sleep, strongly suggests that the participant's physiological system is experiencing significant disruption, likely linked to their perceived stress.

Considering the entirety of the data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. The strong self-reported indicators of depressive symptoms, chronic anxiety, and poor sleep quality, combined with physiological evidence of disrupted diurnal heart rate patterns and significant sleep irregularity, strongly suggest a higher-than-average perceived stress experience. While some physiological metrics such as resting heart rate are lower than average, the overall pattern of reactivity and irregularity points towards a compromised ability to manage and recover from stressors. The substantial positive correlations between key psychological distress measures and PSS, alongside the significant sleep dysregulation, form a compelling narrative of heightened perceived stress."
71985,"The participant's self-reported data reveal a complex interplay of psychological traits and behaviors, with several indicators pointing towards a higher perceived stress level. The STAI score of 41.0, falling within the ""anxious"" classification and showing a moderate positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress, suggests a disposition towards chronic anxiety. This is further supported by a reported happiness score of 4.0, which is above the population mean for happiness (Z-score of 0.55), indicating a potential tendency to report lower subjective happiness, which often correlates with higher stress. While the CES-D score of 14.0 is classified as ""not depressed"" and has a relatively weak positive correlation (0.28) with perceived stress, it does suggest a low-level presence of depressive symptoms. Conversely, the self-esteem score of 34.0 is notably high (Z-score of -0.59), indicating a strong sense of self-worth, which typically acts as a buffer against stress. Health satisfaction is also relatively low (Z-score of -1.2), suggesting dissatisfaction with physical health, a factor that can contribute to elevated stress. In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in regular exercise, particularly exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score of 1.07), which is generally considered a positive coping mechanism. However, the participant reports significant time spent on sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score of 1.28) and playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score of 2.47), which are associated with a higher Z-score for video game usage. Trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.5), but shows a negligible correlation with perceived stress.

The wearable-derived physiological data offer additional insights into the participant's daily rhythms and arousal patterns. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits a high degree of regularity, as indicated by a significantly high Interdaily Stability (Z-score of 2.07) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of 1.74), both negatively correlated with perceived stress. This regularity suggests a structured daily routine. The mesor (average heart rate) of 66.36 bpm is below the population mean (Z-score of -1.04), and the resting heart rate of 50.0 bpm is also lower than average (Z-score of -0.97), indicating a generally lower physiological arousal state at rest. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm, however, is slightly elevated (Z-score of 1.01), suggesting a broader range in heart rate fluctuations throughout the day, which, while negatively correlated with perceived stress, could also indicate periods of heightened physiological response. Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of significantly higher deviations from the mesor during evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 6-7 PM: 18.8, 7-8 PM: 20.09, 9-10 PM: 14.99). Notably, these periods of elevated heart rate deviations show moderate negative correlations with perceived stress, implying that higher heart rate during these specific times may be associated with lower perceived stress for this individual, potentially reflecting engagement in enjoyable or relaxing activities. Conversely, deviations during early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -21.14, 3-4 AM: -21.64, 4-5 AM: -24.02) are notably negative, indicating lower-than-average heart rates during these times, which may be reflective of natural sleep cycles. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score of 0.14), which is close to the population average, and a low median sleep start time of 00:21:27. The PSQI score of 5.0 suggests good subjective sleep quality, with a Z-score of -0.8, indicating better-than-average sleep quality. The absence of naps further supports a consistent sleep schedule.

Considering the multimodal data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While indicators such as higher anxiety proneness (STAI score), lower health satisfaction, and significant engagement in sedentary leisure activities like video gaming suggest factors that could contribute to elevated stress, these are counterbalanced by robust indicators of positive coping mechanisms and physiological regulation. The high interdaily stability and autocorrelation of heart rate, along with a generally lower resting heart rate and good sleep quality, point towards a well-regulated physiological system and a structured daily routine, which are typically associated with lower perceived stress. The correlation patterns observed, particularly the negative correlation between evening heart rate deviations and perceived stress, further suggest that the participant may effectively manage or even benefit from periods of heightened physiological activity during their leisure time, which could mitigate overall stress perception. Therefore, while not unequivocally low, the combination of a structured physiological rhythm, good sleep, and consistent exercise suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress is likely comparable to the average within the study sample."
43125,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a profile characterized by elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety, alongside a tendency towards poorer sleep quality. Specifically, the participant reported a CES-D score of 37.0, which is 2.47 standard deviations above the mean for the study population and classified as ""Depressed."" Similarly, the STAI-Trait score was 53.0, representing 1.16 standard deviations above the mean and indicating a classification of ""anxious."" Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, was also notably poor, with a score of 10.0, 1.52 standard deviations above the mean, and classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" These metrics, particularly the elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and disturbed sleep, are likely contributing factors to a higher perceived stress level. While self-esteem (Z-Score: -0.73) and happiness (Z-Score: -0.53) were lower than average, they did not reach clinically significant levels in this assessment. Health satisfaction was also slightly below average (Z-Score: -0.7).

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a notable level of substance use, reporting beer consumption three times a week or more (Z-Score: 1.72) and wine or liquor 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 0.94). Recreational drug use was reported at 1-2 times a week (Z-Score: 5.44), representing a significant deviation from the population mean. Conversely, the participant reported no engagement in physical exercise, including exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, with Z-scores of -1.93, -1.58, and -1.09 respectively. Daily recreational habits indicate a substantial amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 1.28) and playing video games (31 minutes to an hour, Z-Score: 1.71), and a moderate amount of internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score: 0.85). Less time is spent listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, or engaging in sedentary hobbies. The lack of physical activity and high engagement in sedentary recreational activities may correlate with increased perceived stress.

Analysis of wearable-derived data reveals patterns that may be indicative of both stress and a less regulated lifestyle. The participant's heart rate exhibits a higher average mesor (78.48, Z-Score: 0.62) and a significantly higher amplitude (14.99, Z-Score: 1.36), suggesting greater fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, potentially related to heightened physiological arousal. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates elevated heart rate during evening and late-night hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: 19.36, 8-9 PM: 18.99, 9-10 PM: 15.7, 10-11 PM: 17.28, 11 PM-12 AM: 12.95), and also during early morning hours (12-1 AM: 9.88, 1-2 AM: 3.02), which deviates from typical diurnal patterns and could reflect disrupted sleep or physiological responses to stress. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 28 minutes (Z-Score: 0.35), which is near the population average. However, the median sleep start time is consistently late at 2:00 AM, with a standard deviation of 45 minutes, suggesting irregular sleep timing. The intradaily variability of heart rate is relatively low (0.49, Z-Score: -0.39), while interdaily stability is also low (0.44, Z-Score: 0.25), indicating less regularity in the circadian rhythm of heart rate, which can be associated with stress. The high z-score for recreational drug use is a particularly salient behavioral indicator that can be associated with maladaptive coping mechanisms and higher perceived stress.

In summary, the participant exhibits several indicators consistent with higher perceived stress, including elevated scores for depression and anxiety, disturbed sleep, significant substance use, and a lack of physical activity. These self-reported factors, combined with physiological data showing higher heart rate amplitude and deviations from a regular circadian rhythm, strongly suggest a profile of elevated perceived stress. Comparing the participant's overall perceived stress level to the population mean PSS score of the study sample, the data points towards a perception of stress that is likely **above the population mean**."
98117,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted profile suggesting a moderately elevated level of perceived stress, as indicated by self-reported psychological traits and sleep patterns, relative to the study population. Notably, elevated scores on the CES-D scale (Z=2.05) and the STAI-Trait scale (Z=1.16) suggest a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and a greater proneness to chronic anxiety, respectively. These findings are congruent with a higher perceived stress load. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality as measured by the PSQI (Z=0.59), a factor frequently associated with increased stress.

The participant's sleep statistics from wearable data further support a pattern of irregular and potentially insufficient sleep. A median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes, coupled with a notably high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z=3.02), suggests considerable inconsistency in nightly rest. The median sleep start time of 04:03:17, with an exceptionally high standard deviation (Z=4.33), points towards significant irregularity in the sleep-wake cycle. This circadian disruption, as evidenced by the unstable sleep schedule, can exacerbate feelings of stress. The low positive correlation between sleep duration variability and PSS score (0.14) suggests that while variability exists, it is not a dominant predictor of perceived stress in this dataset.

In contrast, several behavioral and physiological indicators suggest a relatively lower perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of substance usage (e.g., Beer Z=-1.12, Wine or Liquor Z=-1.3, Recreational Drugs Z=-0.31, Non-prescribed Drugs Z=-0.11) and minimal engagement in physical activities such as exercising alone (Z=-1.93), with others (Z=-1.58), or participating in sports (Z=-1.09). While low engagement in exercise might typically be linked to higher stress, the absence of substance use could be a mitigating factor. Additionally, the participant's self-reported happiness is relatively low (Z=-1.61), and trust of others is also low (Z=-2.07), which are generally associated with lower perceived well-being, but these metrics have weak negative correlations with PSS.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals patterns of physiological arousal that generally align with typical daily rhythms, albeit with some deviations. The mesor (average heart rate around the circadian rhythm) is slightly elevated (Z=0.96), suggesting a higher baseline heart rate compared to the population. The Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor values indicate a pattern of increased heart rate during late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 5-6 PM with Z=0.54, 11 PM-12 AM with Z=0.61), and significantly lower deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM with Z=1.0, 3-4 AM with Z=1.5). This could imply a physiological response to stress or a disrupted sleep-wake cycle influencing cardiovascular activity during these periods. The low correlations between these deviations and PSS scores suggest these specific hourly patterns are not primary drivers of perceived stress for this individual within this dataset. The overall circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Z=-0.08) and intradaily variability (Z=-1.73), suggest a relatively stable circadian rhythm, which is generally associated with lower stress levels.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the integrated data, appears to be **near the mean** of the study sample (Population PSS Mean = 21.61; this participant's PSS score is not directly provided but the indicators suggest a moderate level). While elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, and significant sleep irregularity suggest factors contributing to higher stress, the absence of substance use and a relatively stable circadian rhythm (despite sleep timing irregularities) offer counterbalancing insights. The constellation of these factors points to a moderate perceived stress experience within the context of this academic semester."
24883,"The participant exhibits a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is likely within the average range for the study population. While the specific PSS score is not directly provided, the available data suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing perceived stress.

Several self-reported measures indicate a potential for higher perceived stress. The participant's score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) categorizes them as ""anxious,"" with a score of 42.0, which is very close to the population mean (Z-score of 0.07). This suggests a proneness to anxiety that could contribute to elevated stress levels. Furthermore, the participant's body mass index (BMI) is 16.84, which is considered underweight. While not directly a stress indicator, it can be associated with physiological vulnerabilities that may be exacerbated by stress. The PSQI score of 6.0, classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" also points towards potential stress-related challenges, as poor sleep quality is strongly linked to increased perceived stress.

Conversely, certain indicators suggest a potential for lower perceived stress or resilience. The participant reports a relatively low frequency of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 9.0, Z-score of -0.45, classified as ""Not depressed""). Their self-esteem score of 49.0 is notably high (Z-score of 1.52), indicating strong self-worth, which is generally associated with greater stress coping abilities. They also report high levels of happiness (Z-score of -0.53) and satisfaction with their health (Z-score of -0.7). The participant's reported alcohol usage (Beer and Wine or Liquor) is ""1-2 times a week,"" which is above the population average in terms of frequency (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), suggesting potential engagement in coping behaviors. However, their use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs is reported as ""Not at all,"" indicating no engagement in these potentially higher-risk coping mechanisms.

Analysis of wearable data reveals patterns that offer further insights. The circadian rhythm metrics show an ""Interdaily Stability"" of 0.29 (Z-score of -0.99) and ""Intradaily Variability"" of 0.36 (Z-score of -1.31), suggesting a less regular and more variable daily rhythm in heart rate compared to the population. This reduced stability and increased variability in circadian rhythm, particularly when combined with a ""Mesor"" (average heart rate) of 69.03 (Z-score of -0.67) and an ""Amplitude"" of 7.35 (Z-score of -1.11), might indicate physiological dysregulation that could be influenced by or contribute to perceived stress. The sleep statistics indicate a ""Median Sleep Duration"" of 6 hours and 53 minutes (Z-score of -0.38), which is slightly below the population mean, and a ""Median Sleep Start Time"" of 03:00:00, which is notably late. This pattern of restricted and irregular sleep is a significant contributor to elevated stress.

The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight periods of increased physiological arousal during the late night and early morning hours. Specifically, the deviations between 1 AM and 4 AM are markedly positive and show high Z-scores (e.g., 2.36 for 1-2 AM, 2.82 for 2-3 AM), suggesting elevated heart rate during these typically restorative periods. This is concerning as it deviates from the expected pattern of decreasing heart rate during sleep. Conversely, there are notable negative deviations, indicating lower than average heart rate, during the later morning hours (e.g., -19.54 for 6-7 AM, -20.52 for 7-8 AM), which could reflect a protracted transition into wakefulness or reduced physiological responsiveness during this period. The later ""Acrophase"" of 7:01 PM also suggests a delayed circadian phase.

Overall, the participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. While strong self-esteem, low depressive symptoms, and high reported happiness offer a buffer, the notable anxiety proneness, disturbed sleep quality, and disrupted circadian rhythm, particularly the late sleep onset and elevated heart rate during early morning hours, are significant indicators of potential stress. The frequency of alcohol consumption, while potentially serving as a coping mechanism, may also contribute to sleep disturbance and further impact stress regulation."
66815,"The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by generally lower than average self-reported anxiety and depression, alongside elevated self-esteem and happiness. Specifically, their score on the STAI–Trait scale falls near the population mean for anxiety proneness, and their CES-D score indicates a low burden of depressive symptoms, both of which correlate positively, though modestly, with perceived stress. The participant reports high levels of self-esteem, which correlates negatively with perceived stress, suggesting a potential buffer against stress. Happiness levels are significantly above the population mean, also correlating negatively with perceived stress. Similarly, trust in others is notably high, correlating neutrally with perceived stress, and satisfaction with physical health is near the population average with a slight negative correlation to perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a largely sedentary lifestyle with minimal engagement in activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music, or reading for extended periods. They report no substance usage and infrequent exercise alone or participation in sports, with a Z-score indicating less than 1-2 times a month for these activities. However, consistent engagement in exercising with others, occurring three times a week or more, is a notable exception and correlates negatively with perceived stress. This pattern of restricted recreational and physical activity, aside from group exercise, generally shows weak to negligible correlations with perceived stress, with reading showing a modest negative correlation.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data indicates a well-regulated circadian rhythm, evidenced by high interdaily stability and a relatively low intradaily variability in heart rate, placing these metrics above and within the population mean respectively. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is below the population mean, suggesting less consistent daily rhythmicity. Their resting heart rate and mesor are below the population mean, indicating a lower baseline cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of their circadian rhythm is notably high, suggesting a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate, and this correlates negatively with perceived stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a distinct pattern of physiological arousal. Notably, deviations from the mesor are significantly elevated during the late afternoon and evening hours (5-6 PM, 9-10 PM), peaking considerably between 5-6 PM. Conversely, heart rate deviations are lowest in the early morning hours (3-6 AM), suggesting a period of minimal physiological arousal. The elevated heart rate during evening hours, particularly the large deviation from the mesor, shows a neutral correlation with perceived stress, suggesting this specific pattern is not a strong indicator of higher stress.

Sleep statistics indicate a near-average median sleep duration and a standard deviation in sleep duration that is below the population mean, suggesting consistent sleep patterns. However, the median sleep start time is considerably later than the population average, and the standard deviation in sleep start time is also below average, indicating consistency in late sleep initiation. These sleep metrics generally show weak correlations with perceived stress. The overall PSQI score is below the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, suggesting good subjective sleep quality.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's elevated self-esteem and happiness, coupled with low anxiety and depressive symptoms, likely contribute to a lower perceived stress level. While the sedentary aspects of their daily routine might be expected to correlate with higher stress, the consistent engagement in group exercise and the robust nature of their circadian rhythm, including a higher amplitude, may serve as protective factors. The late sleep start time and the elevated heart rate deviations in the evening are notable physiological patterns but do not strongly suggest increased perceived stress.

Based on these observations, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **below the population mean**."
89161,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean, with several indicators pointing towards relatively lower stress and others towards moderately elevated stress. Self-report measures for depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4.0) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31.0) fall within classifications of ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. These scores are notably below the population mean for similar metrics, as indicated by their negative Z-scores (-0.97 and -1.02). Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES Z-Score = 1.52) and happiness (Z-Score = 1.64), and a relatively high satisfaction with their health (Health Satisfaction Z-Score = 1.38), all of which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI (Score = 5.0), is classified as ""Good Sleep"" and is below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance.

In contrast, certain behavioral patterns and physiological metrics suggest potential areas of elevated stress. The participant exhibits higher than average daily internet usage (Z-Score = 1.52), prolonged listening to music (Z-Score = 2.06), and extensive social interaction with friends (Z-Score = 2.53), which, while potentially positive, could also indicate attempts to cope with or distract from stress. Substance usage, including beer (Z-Score = 1.01), wine or liquor (Z-Score = 0.94), and recreational drugs (Z-Score = 5.44), is more frequent than the population average, with recreational drug usage being particularly pronounced. Physiologically, the intraday variability of heart rate (Intradaily Variability Z-Score = 1.3) is elevated, suggesting a more erratic physiological response throughout the day, which can be indicative of stress. Additionally, several hourly deviations from the heart rate mesor show significantly higher values during late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 10-11 PM, Z-Score = 1.65; 11-12 AM, Z-Score = 1.29; 12-1 AM, Z-Score = 0.9), which may reflect difficulties in winding down or sleep disturbances not captured by subjective reports.

Considering the combination of low scores on measures of depression, anxiety, and high self-esteem, alongside higher than average internet, music, and social engagement, and notably elevated recreational drug usage and intraday heart rate variability, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean of 21.62. The positive self-report data regarding mental well-being and satisfaction counterbalance the physiological and some behavioral indicators that suggest potential stress responses. The average PSS score for the study population is 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68, meaning the 25th percentile is 20.0 and the 75th percentile is 24.0. Based on the available data, the participant's perceived stress level is inferred to be near this population mean."
14847,"The participant's self-reported data indicates a psychological profile suggestive of heightened stress. A high score on the CES-D scale (24.0, Z-score 1.11) classifies them as experiencing depressive symptoms, and this score has a moderate positive correlation (0.28) with perceived stress. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score (50.0, Z-score 0.86) suggests a proneness to chronic anxiety, with a moderate positive correlation (0.31) to perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) indicates disturbed sleep, which is significantly above the typical threshold for clinical concern and exhibits a positive correlation (though not explicitly provided, its high Z-score implies a notable relationship) with perceived stress. This constellation of high depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, and poor sleep quality collectively points towards a higher perceived stress experience.

In contrast, certain self-report measures suggest a more stable or less stressful psychological state. The participant reports moderate self-esteem, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.45), indicating a level of self-worth that is slightly below the population mean but not indicative of significant distress. Their reported current happiness level is also slightly above the population mean (Z-score 0.55), suggesting positive affect. Furthermore, their reported trust in others is substantially below the population mean (Z-score -3.03), which, while indicative of lower interpersonal trust, does not directly correlate with perceived stress in this dataset (-0.03). These factors, particularly self-esteem and happiness, do not strongly suggest high perceived stress.

Analysis of wearable data provides further insight into the participant's behavioral and physiological patterns. The participant exhibits significantly increased intradaily variability (Z-score 2.01), suggesting greater fluctuations in physiological activity throughout the day, which can be associated with stress. Their sleep patterns are also notable for their irregularity: a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score -0.69) is below average, and the standard deviation of sleep duration (134 minutes, Z-score 0.75) and sleep start time (104 minutes, Z-score 0.46) indicate inconsistency. The high average daily nap frequency (Z-score 1.9) further suggests attempts to compensate for insufficient nocturnal sleep. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor in heart rate data reveals marked increases during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: deviation -3.03, 3-4 AM: deviation -15.26, 4-5 AM: deviation -17.08, 5-6 AM: deviation -22.49), indicating potential physiological arousal or disruption during periods that are typically associated with rest. These physiological and sleep irregularities are likely contributors to or indicators of a higher perceived stress level.

Considering the provided data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to be above the population mean. This inference is primarily driven by the elevated self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, and significantly disturbed sleep quality. While self-esteem and happiness are not indicative of high stress, the strong presence of other negative psychological indicators, coupled with physiological data showing high intradaily variability and disrupted sleep patterns, strongly suggests a higher overall level of perceived stress. The population mean PSS score is 21.61, with a standard deviation of 3.68, placing the 50th percentile at 22.0. Given the convergence of multiple stress-related indicators in this participant, it is reasonable to infer their perceived stress level is above the population mean."
43382,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with indicators that suggest both elevated and reduced perceived stress levels, making a definitive holistic assessment challenging without direct PSS scores. Analysis of self-report survey data reveals several notable points. The participant reports a CES-D score of 28.0, which is 1.53 standard deviations above the population mean for this metric, and is classified as ""Depressed."" This elevated score, while positively correlated with PSS (0.29), is a strong indicator of significant depressive symptom burden. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 46.0, with a Z-score of 0.46, indicates a propensity towards chronic anxiety, with a positive correlation of 0.32 with PSS. Conversely, the participant reports a higher-than-average happiness score (Z-score of 1.64) and higher self-esteem (Z-score of -0.87), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19 and -0.16 respectively). Health satisfaction is moderately above the population mean (Z-score of 1.22), with a weak negative correlation (-0.07) to PSS. Substance usage is notably low across all categories, with Z-scores consistently below -0.50, and minimal correlations to PSS. Similarly, exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is very low (Z-scores of -1.93 and -1.58), with negligible correlations to PSS. Daily recreational habits show varied engagement; time spent watching TV/videos is average, while internet usage is notably low (Z-score of -1.83). Socializing with friends and reading are also on the lower side of average frequency.

Wearable data offers further insights into physiological regulation and behavioral patterns. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate regularity; Interdaily Stability (0.45) is slightly above the population mean (Z-score of 0.33), while Intradaily Variability (0.44) is below the population mean (Z-score of -0.74), suggesting a somewhat structured daily pattern. The Mesor (83.24) is notably elevated (Z-score of 1.27), indicating a higher average heart rate compared to the population. This elevated Mesor, along with a resting heart rate of 63.4 (Z-score of 0.62), suggests a generally higher physiological arousal state. The Acrophase at 4:54 PM aligns with typical diurnal patterns. Analysis of hourly deviations from the Mesor reveals patterns of cardiovascular activity. Specifically, there are noticeable elevations in heart rate deviation during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 3-4 PM, 9-10 PM, 10-11 PM), with positive values indicating heart rate above the daily average for that time. Conversely, significant dips are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM), consistent with sleep. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes, which is significantly below the population mean (Z-score of -1.27), suggesting insufficient sleep. The median sleep start time of 01:28:09 AM is also notably late. The duration of sleep is relatively consistent from night to night (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of 0.44).

Considering the totality of the data, the participant presents with several significant indicators associated with heightened perceived stress. The notably high score on the CES-D scale, indicating substantial depressive symptom burden, is a primary concern. This is further underscored by a tendency towards chronic anxiety as measured by the STAI-Trait. The physiological data suggests a generally elevated baseline of arousal, as indicated by the higher Mesor and resting heart rate, which could be exacerbated by stress. Furthermore, insufficient sleep duration and late sleep onset are common correlates of perceived stress and negatively impact well-being. While the participant reports higher happiness and self-esteem, which would typically be associated with lower stress, these positive self-perceptions may be contradicted by the objective measures of depressive symptoms and anxiety. The low engagement in physical activity and moderate social engagement may also contribute to a lack of stress-buffering behaviors.

The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, although not directly provided, is inferred to be above the population mean based on the presence of significant depressive symptoms, chronic anxiety, and insufficient sleep, which are all strongly associated with higher perceived stress. The population mean PSS is 21.62, with a median of 22.0 and a 75th percentile of 24.0. The participant's elevated CES-D score (1.53 SD above the mean) and STAI score (0.46 SD above the mean), coupled with significantly short sleep duration (1.27 SD below the mean), strongly suggest a PSS score falling above this distribution."
75438,"The participant's self-reported data suggest a profile associated with relatively lower perceived stress. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 7.0, with a Z-score of -0.66, indicates a low level of depressive symptoms, falling below the population mean. Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 36.0, with a Z-score of -0.52, suggests a low propensity for chronic anxiety. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), is relatively high with a score of 33.0 and a Z-score of -0.73, indicating strong self-worth. Happiness levels are also reported as moderate (3.0 on a higher is happier scale, Z-score -0.53). Trust in others is notably low (2.67 with a Z-score of -1.1), which could be a point of concern in interpersonal contexts, but its correlation with perceived stress is negligible. Sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is rated as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score of 6.0, Z-score -0.33), which might typically be associated with higher stress, however, the Z-score is only slightly below the threshold often indicating clinically significant disturbance, and its correlation with perceived stress is weak.

Behavioral data further support a profile of lower perceived stress. The participant engages in moderate levels of exercise, with a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" for exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), and ""1-2 times a week"" for exercising with others (Z-score 0.53) and sports (Z-score 0.91). Alcohol consumption is in the ""1-2 times a week"" range for wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94), which is above average for the population, while beer consumption is less frequent (""1-2 times a month"", Z-score 0.3). Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is minimal. Notably, the participant dedicates minimal time to sedentary activities like watching TV/videos/movies (""Do not do"", Z-score -1.25) and video games (""Do not do"", Z-score -0.56). Internet usage is moderate (""31 minutes an hour"", Z-score -0.49), and they spend considerable time socializing with friends (""2-3 hours"", Z-score 0.95), and listening to music (""1-2 hours"", Z-score 0.67). Reading and other sedentary hobbies are less frequent.

Physiological data from wearable devices also generally indicate lower stress levels. The participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (53.0 bpm, Z-score -0.61), which is often associated with good cardiovascular health and lower stress. The mesor, a measure of the daily average heart rate, is also below the population mean (69.46, Z-score -0.61). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is near the population mean (10.53, Z-score -0.08). Circadian rhythm analysis reveals moderate interdaily stability (0.33, Z-score -0.66), suggesting some regularity in daily activity patterns, and low intradaily variability (0.39, Z-score -1.09), indicating less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, both of which can be indicative of lower stress. Sleep duration is notably short, with a median of 6 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score -1.43), which, while potentially a stressor, has a weak negative correlation with perceived stress in this dataset. Sleep start times are also variable (standard deviation of 66 minutes, Z-score -0.38), but overall, the physiological data present a picture of a regulated system.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be below the population mean. The strong indicators of low depressive symptoms, low anxiety, high self-esteem, consistent engagement in social activities and exercise, and a relatively stable physiological rhythm all contribute to this inference. The shorter sleep duration is a potential area for concern but does not appear to be the dominant factor influencing perceived stress in this individual.

The participant's self-reported PSS score is not directly provided in the data. However, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that their overall perceived stress level is likely **below the population mean**. The mean PSS score for the study population is 21.62, with a standard deviation of 3.68. The participant exhibits several traits and behaviors that are negatively correlated with stress or are indicative of lower stress. For instance, low CES-D and STAI scores, high self-esteem, and social engagement are typically associated with lower perceived stress. While the PSQI score indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" this does not strongly correlate with PSS in the provided data. The physiological data, such as lower resting heart rate and mesor, and lower intradaily variability, also suggest a less stressed state. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the participant's perceived stress level is likely below the population average."
99733,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level relative to the study population. This inference is supported by several indicators. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 5.0, Z-score -0.86) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score -1.02), both of which are classified as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" respectively. Furthermore, self-esteem is within a healthy range (SelfEsteem score of 33.0, Z-score -0.73), and current happiness is reported as moderately high (Happy score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI score of 4.0, Z-score -1.26), indicating a lack of significant sleep disturbance. Substance usage is notably absent across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs), with significantly negative Z-scores for Beer and Wine or Liquor usage. While exercise frequency with others and sports participation are low, regular exercise alone occurs 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Exercised Alone Z-score 0.32). Daily recreational habits include minimal engagement with passive media like Watching TV/Videos/Movies (15 minutes or less) and video games, and lower than average internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends. Reading habits are above average (Reading Time Z-score 0.32) and sedentary hobbies are minimal.

Conversely, certain physiological metrics derived from wearable data may suggest areas of potential strain or dysregulation that could contribute to perceived stress, although these are less strongly correlated with the PSS score in the provided data. The participant exhibits higher than average intraday variability in heart rate (Intraday Variability Z-score 1.09), which can be indicative of greater physiological fluctuation throughout the day. Additionally, the resting heart rate is above the population mean (Resting Heart Rate Value 62.6, Z-score 0.53), which could suggest a baseline state of heightened physiological arousal. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows notable peaks in positive deviation during the late morning and early afternoon hours (e.g., 11 am-12 pm Z-score 1.08, 12 pm-1 pm Z-score 1.08), indicating periods of increased cardiovascular activity during typical waking hours. Sleep duration, while not extremely short (Median Sleep Duration 6 hours 43 minutes, Z-score -0.58), is below the median sleep duration of the population, which, combined with a slightly higher than average nap frequency (Mean Daily Naps Value 0.09, Z-score 0.21), might suggest some disruption or inadequacy in sleep patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is lower than average (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Value 0.26, Z-score -0.53), potentially indicating less regularity in daily physiological rhythms.

Considering the aggregate of these findings, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While self-reported psychological well-being and lifestyle choices are indicative of lower stress, the physiological data, particularly concerning heart rate variability and resting heart rate, suggest a level of physiological arousal that may contribute to a moderate perception of stress, bringing the overall assessment closer to the study's population average. The participant's reported Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, when inferred holistically from the provided data, would likely fall near the population mean of 21.62."
27407,"The participant’s overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, appears to be near the population mean. While certain indicators suggest a higher stress experience, these are balanced by factors pointing towards lower perceived stress.

Several self-reported measures indicate a potential for elevated stress. The participant reports a trait anxiety score (STAI) of 50.0, which is above the population mean for trait anxiety and exhibits a positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0, which is significantly above the threshold for disturbed sleep and has a Z-score of 1.52, suggests a considerable subjective experience of poor sleep quality. This metric also shows a positive correlation (though not explicitly provided, it's inferred from context of PSQI interpretation) with perceived stress, aligning with the known link between sleep disturbance and stress. The participant's reported happiness level, while not drastically low, is slightly below average (Z-score of 0.55), and the correlation with perceived stress is negative (-0.19), suggesting lower happiness may be associated with higher stress.

Conversely, several factors suggest a lower perceived stress level. The participant’s score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is 13.0, which falls into the ""Not depressed"" classification and shows a negligible correlation (0.28) with perceived stress. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is reasonably high with a score of 36.0 (Z-Score of -0.31), and exhibits a negative correlation (-0.15) with perceived stress, indicating that higher self-esteem may buffer against perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also relatively high with a score of 3.56 (Z-score of -0.53), and its correlation with perceived stress is negative (-0.08). Behavioral data also contributes to this interpretation. The participant engages in moderate levels of exercise (1-2 times a week for both solo and group exercise), and their overall sleep duration, while below average (Z-score of -1.17), is not extremely short. The standard deviation for sleep duration is relatively high (Z-score of 0.43), suggesting variability rather than consistently short sleep. Furthermore, the participant engages in relatively low amounts of sedentary recreational activities like watching TV/videos and playing video games, and moderate internet usage.

Physiological data from the wearable device provides further nuance. The participant exhibits a lower than average resting heart rate (46.3 bpm, Z-score of -1.41) and a lower than average Mesor (65.18, Z-score of -1.2), which could suggest a more relaxed physiological baseline. However, there are notable patterns in the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor. Significant deviations are observed during later evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM showing positive deviations), which might indicate periods of physiological arousal or disruption during times typically associated with rest. Conversely, early morning hours (3-6 AM) show substantial negative deviations, suggesting very low physiological activity during this period, which aligns with sleep. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is reported as 5:46 PM, which is within a typical range. Interdaily stability is near the population mean (Z-score of -0.08), suggesting a moderate level of regularity in daily activity patterns, while intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (Z-score of -0.25), which might indicate less fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.39), indicating some degree of daily rhythmicity."
43794,"The participant exhibits a complex pattern of psychological and behavioral characteristics that may influence perceived stress. Notably, their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) are notably elevated, with a Z-score of 1.35, indicating a higher proneness to chronic anxiety compared to the study population. This aligns with a positive correlation between STAI scores and perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score = 0.59), which is above the threshold commonly associated with clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is further supported by a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours, with a standard deviation of 156 minutes, suggesting potential variability and irregularity in sleep patterns. The average sleep start time is around 1:02 AM, with a standard deviation of 122 minutes, indicating a pronounced tendency towards late sleep onset and variability in sleep timing.

Conversely, several indicators suggest a lower perceived stress level or resilience. The participant reports generally good self-esteem, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) score of 32.0 (Z-score = -0.87), which is below the population mean, implying higher self-worth. Similarly, self-reported happiness levels are also below the population mean (Z-score = -0.53), and while not strongly correlated with PSS, this may suggest a baseline disposition towards lower subjective distress. Notably, CES-D scores are within the ""Not depressed"" range (Score = 10.0, Z-score = -0.34), and the correlation with PSS is moderate and positive. Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score = -1.45), suggesting potential dissatisfaction with physical well-being, which could indirectly contribute to stress. While alcohol consumption (wine or liquor) is at a frequency of 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.94), other substance usage is infrequent. Daily recreation includes extensive listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score = 2.06), which is a significant deviation from the population norm, but also includes sedentary habits such as watching TV for 15 minutes or less (Z-score = -0.62) and video games which are not engaged in.

Analysis of wearable data provides further insight into physiological regulation and activity patterns. The participant displays significantly reduced interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.73), suggesting a lack of robust daily rhythmicity in their physiological and behavioral patterns, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, intradaily variability is near the population mean (Z-score = 0.03), indicating typical within-day fluctuations. The mesor, representing the daily average heart rate, is slightly above the population mean (Z-score = 0.41), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is notably low (Z-score = -1.76), suggesting a flattened circadian rhythm. The acrophase of the heart rate rhythm is approximately 5:00 PM. The resting heart rate itself is elevated above the population mean (Z-score = 1.5). Examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of elevated heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, Z-scores around 1.58), which then gradually decreases throughout the day, reaching its lowest points in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 1-3 PM, Z-scores around -1.12). This pattern, combined with the disturbed sleep metrics and high trait anxiety, likely contributes to elevated perceived stress.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the combined data, appears to be above the population mean. The convergence of elevated trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, reduced daily rhythmicity, and a higher resting heart rate, despite some indicators of self-esteem and happiness, suggests a state of elevated psychological and physiological arousal that is likely associated with higher perceived stress."
51437,"The participant exhibits a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is **above the population mean**. This is supported by several indicators within the provided data. Notably, the participant's resting heart rate is significantly elevated compared to the study population (Z-score of 1.77), suggesting a heightened physiological arousal state. This aligns with a high PSS score, as individuals experiencing greater stress often display increased baseline heart rate. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor for heart rate also reveals pronounced peaks during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM with a Z-score of 3.91, 1-2 AM with a Z-score of 2.04), indicating considerable cardiovascular activity during periods typically associated with rest. Furthermore, the participant's intradaily variability of heart rate is notably high (Z-score of 1.51), signifying greater fluctuation and potential instability in their physiological responses throughout the day. While the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than the population mean (Z-score of -1.59), suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate, the overall pattern points towards heightened physiological arousal and reactivity.

Conversely, certain behavioral and self-reported metrics suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress or indicate a more stable psychological baseline. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.97) and is classified as ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score of 35.0, Z-score of -0.62). These findings indicate a generally stable emotional state, which could buffer against higher levels of perceived stress. Subjective health satisfaction is also relatively high (score of 4.67, Z-score of 0.3). In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in frequent solitary exercise (""Three times a week or more"" with a Z-score of 1.07) and sports participation (""Three times a week or more"" with a Z-score of 1.58), which are generally associated with positive stress management. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs, is infrequent, aligning with healthier behavioral patterns. While the participant engages in moderate daily recreation such as watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.64) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.16), they report minimal engagement in sedentary hobbies or reading.

Despite the presence of some positive indicators, the objectively measured physiological data, particularly the elevated resting heart rate and pronounced hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor during typical sleep periods, alongside high intradaily variability, strongly suggest a state of elevated perceived stress for this participant. These physiological markers, combined with the general upward deviation from the population mean PSS score, indicate that the participant is experiencing a higher level of perceived stress compared to the average within the study sample. The sleep statistics also indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -1.16), and a considerably late median sleep start time of 02:14:30, further contributing to a potential lack of restorative sleep which is often linked to increased stress. The PSQI score of 6.0 suggests disturbed sleep quality, further reinforcing the interpretation of a higher stress load."
21932,"The participant's self-reported data indicate a psychological profile that generally aligns with lower levels of stress, though certain indicators warrant attention. Notably, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and anxiety proneness (STAI score of 28.0, Z-score -1.31), both of which are below the population mean for these measures. Self-esteem is reported as high (RSES score of 50.0, Z-score 1.66), exceeding the typical range for the scale, suggesting a robust sense of self-worth. Happiness levels are also reported as relatively high (Current happiness score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Health satisfaction, while positive, is near the population average (Score of 5.0, Z-score 0.55). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is exceptionally high (ranging from 3.86 to 4.0), further suggesting effective functioning in a demanding environment. Lifestyle behaviors are largely moderate. Substance usage is infrequent, with beer consumption below once a month and wine or liquor used 1-2 times a month. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise frequency is moderate, with solitary exercise and exercise with others occurring 1-2 times per week, and sports participation 1-2 times per month. Daily recreational habits indicate limited engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and listening to music, with internet usage at 1-2 hours and social interaction with friends at around 31 minutes per hour. Reading and other sedentary hobbies are reported as ""Do not do."" Overall, these self-report measures suggest a participant who is psychologically resilient, academically successful, and maintains generally healthy lifestyle choices, which typically correlate with lower perceived stress.

However, certain wearable-derived metrics and self-reported sleep quality suggest potential areas of strain or disruption, which could subtly contribute to perceived stress despite otherwise positive self-assessments. The participant exhibits a relatively high median sleep duration (8 hours 14 minutes, Z-score 1.31), which is a positive indicator. Conversely, the sleep duration standard deviation is relatively low (50 minutes, Z-score -1.15), indicating consistent sleep duration, but the PSQI score of 8.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Z-score 0.59), suggests a subjective experience of poor sleep quality. This discrepancy between objective duration and subjective quality is notable. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals an interdaily stability of 0.49 (Z-score 0.67) and intradaily variability of 0.68 (Z-score 0.95), with autocorrelation at 24 hours at 0.34 (Z-score 0.14). These metrics suggest a moderately regular, but not perfectly consistent, circadian rhythm. The mesor of 69.72 (Z-score -0.58) is below the population average, indicating a generally lower resting heart rate. The amplitude of 12.13 (Z-score 0.44) suggests a moderate diurnal variation in heart rate.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Notably, significant positive deviations, indicating higher than typical heart rate, are observed during specific periods. The most pronounced elevations occur between 10 PM and 11 PM (26.39, Z-score 3.14) and between 12 PM and 1 PM (24.18, Z-score 2.59), with substantial deviations also present from 1 PM to 2 PM (20.23, Z-score 2.11) and 7 PM to 8 PM (17.27, Z-score 1.0). Conversely, the most significant negative deviations, indicating lower than typical heart rate, are observed in the early morning hours, particularly between 4 AM and 5 AM (-23.51, Z-score -0.89), 3 AM and 4 AM (-20.41, Z-score -0.65), and 2 AM and 3 AM (-16.57, Z-score -0.55). These patterns, particularly the elevated heart rate in the late evening and midday, coupled with the self-reported disturbed sleep, may reflect periods of heightened physiological activation that could interfere with relaxation and recovery, potentially contributing to perceived stress. The moderate negative correlation between PSS and happiness (-0.20), and between PSS and reading (-0.22), further suggest that engagement in restorative activities might be inversely related to perceived stress.

Considering the comprehensive dataset, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While self-reported psychological traits and academic performance suggest a low-stress profile, the subjective experience of disturbed sleep and observed physiological patterns of elevated heart rate during specific times of the day, particularly in the evening and midday, introduce nuances that counterbalance the highly positive self-assessments. These physiological indicators of arousal, especially when paired with subjective sleep disturbances, may contribute to a perceived stress level that is not significantly divergent from the average within the study sample. The moderate correlations observed between various metrics and PSS, while not overwhelmingly strong, generally align with this interpretation, suggesting that while the participant exhibits significant resilience, certain physiological and subjective experiences may exert a moderate influence on their overall stress perception."
36385,"The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates a significant burden of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CES-D score of 29.0, which falls 1.63 standard deviations above the population mean and is classified as ""Depressed."" Concurrently, the participant reports higher than average chronic anxiety, with an STAI score of 49.0, placing them 0.76 standard deviations above the mean and categorized as ""anxious."" These findings are positively correlated with perceived stress, with CES-D scores showing a moderate positive correlation (0.28) and STAI scores a weaker positive correlation (0.31). In contrast, self-esteem is reported at a score of 31.0, which is within the typical range and 1.01 standard deviations below the mean, exhibiting a weak negative correlation (-0.15) with perceived stress. Health satisfaction and general happiness are also reported as slightly below average (Z-scores of -0.7 and 0.55 respectively), with weak negative correlations to perceived stress (-0.08 and -0.19).

Behavioral data reveal a pattern of relatively poor sleep quality and regularity. The median sleep duration is notably long at 8 hours and 47 minutes, placing the participant 2.0 standard deviations above the population average, suggesting oversleeping tendencies. The standard deviation of sleep duration (133 minutes) and the standard deviation of sleep start time (140 minutes), both above average (Z-scores of 0.73 and 1.26), indicate considerable variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is late at 00:54:20. Despite the long duration, the PSQI score of 6.0, while only slightly below the population mean (Z-score of -0.33), suggests subjective sleep disturbance. These sleep metrics generally show weak correlations with perceived stress, with sleep duration having a negative correlation (-0.05) and sleep regularity metrics having positive correlations (0.14 and 0.17).

Physiological data, specifically from the wearable device, indicate a moderate resting heart rate of 64.05 bpm, placing the participant 0.7 standard deviations above the population average, with a moderate positive correlation to perceived stress (0.14). The mesor of the heart rate rhythm is also above average (Z-score of 0.41). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals patterns of elevated cardiovascular activity during late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM (Z-scores of 0.37 and 0.65 respectively), and again in the late evening from 9-10 PM and 10-11 PM (Z-scores of 0.82 and 0.75). These periods of higher than average heart rate during atypical times may reflect physiological dysregulation. Non-parametric circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.25) and intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.1), suggesting a somewhat structured but not highly regular daily rhythm. Correlations with perceived stress for these physiological metrics are generally weak to moderate and mixed.

Overall, the participant exhibits a higher than average perceived stress level. This is supported by significant elevations in self-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety, alongside suboptimal sleep patterns characterized by long duration and considerable irregularity. While self-esteem and happiness are not severely compromised, the presence of significant psychological distress and sleep disturbances strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress is above the population mean. The physiological data, particularly the elevated resting heart rate and specific hourly deviations, further reinforce the impression of physiological strain. The participant's perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean of 21.61, considering the combined evidence of elevated psychological distress and sleep irregularity."
54030,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a pattern that may be associated with a relatively low perceived stress level. Notably, the participant reports very low levels of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 3.0, which is significantly below the population mean (Z-score of -1.07). Similarly, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is reported as low (Score: 27.0, Z-score: -1.41). Self-esteem is reported at a high level (Score: 49.0, Z-score: 1.52), and happiness is also reported to be high (Current: 5.0, Z-score: 1.64). Trust in others is also relatively high (Score: 4.0, Z-score: 1.47). These self-reported factors are generally associated with a lower perceived stress response. Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-Score: -0.8) and does not engage in any substance usage.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant does not report any usage of beer, wine, liquor, or recreational drugs, and their usage of non-prescribed drugs is also not at all. While the participant reports not exercising alone (Z-Score: -1.93), they do engage in exercise with others and participate in sports 1-2 times a week, with the latter showing a slight negative correlation with PSS (-0.13). Daily recreational habits indicate moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95), with the latter showing a slightly positive correlation with PSS (0.06). Internet usage and listening to music are reported for approximately 1-2 hours and 31 minutes respectively. Reading and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for shorter durations.

Wearable-derived physiological and behavioral data also provide insights into the participant's daily patterns. The participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm, as suggested by an Interdaily Stability value of 0.28 (Z-Score: -1.07) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of 0.18 (Z-Score: -1.2). The Intradaily Variability is high (Value: 0.88, Z-Score: 2.36), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, which can be influenced by activity levels and arousal. The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is within a typical range (Value: 68.6, Z-Score: -0.73) and the resting heart rate is also within the expected range (Value: 58.4, Z-Score: 0.03), with a slight positive correlation with PSS (0.14). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 18 minutes (Z-Score: -1.09), which is below the typical recommended duration and shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.04). The sleep start time is quite late, with a median of approximately 3 AM, and the standard deviation in sleep start time is moderate (88 minutes, Z-Score: 0.11). The high mean daily nap value (0.22, Z-Score: 1.75) also suggests a potential disruption in the sleep-wake cycle.

Overall, while the participant's self-reported psychological state, low anxiety and depression, and high self-esteem and happiness suggest a low perceived stress level, the wearable data indicate potential areas for consideration. The shorter median sleep duration and late sleep start times, along with higher intradaily heart rate variability, may suggest underlying physiological challenges or behavioral patterns that could contribute to stress, even if not consciously perceived. The PSS population mean is 21.61. Given the generally positive self-report measures and lack of reported negative symptoms, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be below the population mean."
34062,"The analysis of the provided data suggests a participant with a moderate perceived stress level, likely near the population mean. Several indicators contribute to this interpretation.

**Factors Suggesting Relatively Higher Perceived Stress:**

The participant reports a PSQI score of 10.0, which is notably above the common threshold of 5 for indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance and has a Z-score of 1.52, placing it above the population mean for this metric. This suggests a subjective experience of poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant reports higher than average happiness (Z-score of 1.64) and higher than average health satisfaction (Z-score of 1.8). While happiness is often inversely correlated with stress, a higher score here may reflect a coping mechanism or a dispositional trait rather than an absence of stress. The higher health satisfaction, in conjunction with disturbed sleep, may indicate an awareness of health concerns or a desire to maintain well-being despite potential stressors. In terms of daily activities, the participant reports moderate substance usage, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, which can sometimes be associated with stress management behaviors.

**Factors Suggesting Relatively Lower Perceived Stress:**

Conversely, several self-reported psychological measures indicate a potentially lower perceived stress level. The CES-D score of 7.0 is within the ""Not depressed"" classification and has a Z-score of -0.66, suggesting a low burden of depressive symptoms. Similarly, the STAI score of 36.0 is classified as ""not anxious"" with a Z-score of -0.52, indicating low levels of chronic anxiety. Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is relatively high with a score of 48.0 and a Z-score of 1.38, suggesting a positive self-regard. The participant also reports high trust of others (Z-score of -0.46), which can be indicative of a secure social environment, potentially mitigating stress. In terms of exercise habits, the participant frequently exercises alone and with others (three times a week or more), which are healthy coping behaviors positively associated with well-being.

**Physiological and Behavioral Rhythms:**

The wearable data presents a mixed picture regarding physiological regulation. The MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of 58.67 has a Z-score of -2.08, indicating a significantly lower resting heart rate compared to the population, which is generally associated with better cardiovascular health and potentially lower physiological stress reactivity. The resting heart rate itself (45.7) is also low, with a Z-score of -1.48. However, the PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" and a Z-Score of 1.52 points to significant subjective sleep disruption, which is a common correlate of stress. The Interdaily Stability (0.36, Z-score -0.41) and Intradaily Variability (0.57, Z-score 0.17) of the heart rate rhythm are near the population average, suggesting a moderate level of regularity in daily physiological patterns. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.22, Z-score -0.87) is lower than average, implying a weaker adherence to a strict 24-hour rhythm. The hourly deviation from the mesor data shows periods of elevated heart rate during the day (e.g., 7-8 AM, 8-9 AM, 5-6 PM, 6-7 PM) and lower than average heart rate during the night, which is generally expected but the magnitude of deviation during the day might warrant further investigation, though correlations with PSS are not particularly strong for most of these hourly deviations.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Considering the available data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While subjective sleep quality is a notable concern (high PSQI score), this is counterbalanced by strong indicators of low anxiety and depression (low CESD and STAI scores) and high self-esteem. The physically active lifestyle further supports a generally healthy baseline. The relatively low resting heart rate suggests good cardiovascular regulation, which may buffer against the impact of stressors. The overall pattern suggests a participant who, despite potential sleep challenges, possesses robust psychological resources and healthy behavioral patterns that likely contribute to managing perceived stress within a typical range for the study population."
18111,"The participant's data suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely falling around the population mean for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This is supported by several self-report measures, including a relatively low score on the happiness scale (Z-score of -1.61), indicating lower self-reported happiness, which often correlates with higher perceived stress. Additionally, the participant reported a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 27.0, Z-score of 1.42) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score of 0.66), both of which are associated with elevated stress levels. While the participant's self-esteem score is near the population mean (Z-score of -0.31), the other psychological indicators point towards a greater burden of negative affect.

In terms of behavioral patterns and physiological markers, several findings align with a potentially elevated stress profile. The participant exhibits disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI score (8.0, Z-score of 0.59), which is above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is further evidenced by a higher than average frequency of naps (Z-score of 2.27). While the median sleep duration is within a reasonable range (7 hours 16 minutes, Z-score of 0.1), the variability in sleep duration is also slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.27). The wearable data reveals a lower than average amplitude of heart rate variation (Z-score of -1.48), suggesting a less dynamic physiological response to daily demands. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm metric of interdaily stability is notably low (Z-score of -1.4), indicating a less regular daily pattern of heart rate, which can be indicative of disrupted biological rhythms often associated with stress. Conversely, the intradaily variability of heart rate is slightly higher than average (Z-score of 0.24), potentially reflecting more frequent fluctuations in arousal.

However, certain factors suggest a potentially lower perceived stress or buffering influences. The participant maintains a high Grade Point Average (GPA) across multiple semesters (e.g., 3.87 in Fall 2015), indicating academic success. Their self-reported health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53), but not critically low, and their Body Mass Index (BMI) is within the healthy range. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score of 0.16), which can be a positive coping mechanism. The participant also reports not engaging with recreational or non-prescribed drugs and exercises 1-2 times a week, which are healthy lifestyle choices. The aggregated hourly heart rate data does show some deviations from the mesor that might suggest periods of higher arousal, particularly in the evening hours (e.g., 8-9 PM showing a Z-score of 1.85), although the overall mean deviation is not extremely high. The resting heart rate is close to the population mean (Z-score of 0.01), suggesting no significant cardiovascular strain at rest.

Considering the balance of these indicators, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by higher depressive symptomology, anxiety, and lower happiness, alongside disturbed sleep and less stable circadian rhythms, are more prominent indicators of perceived stress. While academic achievement and some healthy habits are present, they do not entirely offset the reported psychological distress and physiological irregularities. Therefore, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean of the study sample."
59097,"The participant exhibits a complex pattern of behaviors and physiological indicators that collectively suggest a moderate to high level of perceived stress. Self-reported measures indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of 1.53) and a tendency towards anxiety (STAI Z-score of 0.56). While self-esteem is near the population mean (SelfEsteem Z-score of -0.31), and trust is below average (Trust Z-score of -0.78), these are weakly correlated with perceived stress. Similarly, lower self-reported happiness (Happy Z-score of -1.61) correlates negatively with perceived stress, suggesting that a happier state is associated with lower stress levels. Sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, is characterized as disturbed (PSQI Z-score of 0.59), aligning with the general trend of higher perceived stress.

Behavioral data provides further context for the participant's stress experience. Notably, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer Z-score of 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score of 0.94), which can sometimes be a coping mechanism for stress. While physical activity levels are mixed, with regular participation in sports (Sports Z-score of 0.91) but infrequent general exercise, and sedentary recreational habits such as watching TV (Watching TV/Videos/Movies Z-score of 0.01) and internet usage (Internet Usage Z-score of 0.18) are near population averages, the overall pattern does not strongly suggest high stress due to lack of engagement in healthy behaviors, except for relatively low time spent reading (Reading Z-score of 0.32, correlation of -0.21). Socializing with friends (Socializing with Friends Z-score of 0.95) is a notable positive behavior.

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data reveal a disrupted circadian rhythm, indicative of potential stress. The interdaily stability of heart rate is below average (Interdaily Stability Z-score of 1.33), suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns, and intradaily variability is elevated (Intradaily Variability Z-score of -1.52). This is further supported by a significantly higher than average mesor (Mesor Z-score of 0.78) and amplitude (Amplitude Z-score of 1.28), implying a generally higher resting heart rate and a larger fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, potentially reflecting heightened physiological arousal. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates periods of significant deviation from the normal heart rate rhythm, particularly during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM with a Z-score of -1.34). Sleep statistics show a longer than average median sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of 1.5), but with a substantial standard deviation (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.62), and a relatively stable median sleep start time (Median Sleep Start Time is 01:07:45, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.99). The longer sleep duration, despite potential disruptions, could be an attempt to compensate for perceived stress or fatigue.

Considering the combination of elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, disturbed sleep, and physiological indicators of disrupted circadian rhythm and heightened arousal, the participant's overall perceived stress level is inferred to be above the population mean. The PSS population mean is 21.62, with a 75th percentile of 24.0. While the explicit PSS score is not provided, the convergence of these multiple indicators suggests a state of heightened stress that is likely to place the participant in the upper range of perceived stress within this study sample."
24833,"The participant exhibits several characteristics that are associated with a higher perceived stress level, relative to the study population. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, while only marginally above the population mean (indicated by a Z-score of 0.13), suggests a classification of ""Disturbed Sleep,"" which is often correlated with increased stress. Furthermore, the participant's median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes has a negative Z-score (-0.32), indicating it is below the population median, and a slight negative correlation with perceived stress. The low amplitude (Z-score of -1.58) of their heart rate rhythm, particularly when contrasted with a relatively high Mesor (Z-score of 0.4), may suggest a less robust cardiovascular response to daily fluctuations, potentially reflecting a state of chronic physiological strain. Notably, several hourly deviations from the mesor show elevated positive Z-scores during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z=1.12; 4-5 AM, Z=1.56; 5-6 AM, Z=1.21), indicating periods of higher-than-average heart rate deviation during these times, which could be indicative of disrupted sleep or increased physiological arousal during typical rest periods.

Conversely, several indicators suggest a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports generally low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.82, classified as ""not anxious"") and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.34, classified as ""Not depressed""). Their self-esteem score (Z-score of 0.82) is notably above the population mean, and their reported happiness (Z-score of -0.53) is also below the population mean, although the correlation with perceived stress is negative. The participant also reports lower-than-average substance usage (Beer Z-score of 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-score of 0.94), with recreational and non-prescribed drug usage being minimal (Z-scores of -0.31 and -0.11 respectively). Physical health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z-score of 0.8). Furthermore, the interdaily stability of their heart rate (Z-score of -1.98) is significantly lower than the population mean, suggesting less regularity in their daily behavioral patterns, which can sometimes be a buffer against high stress if it reflects flexibility rather than disorganization. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score of -1.79) being low also suggests less adherence to a strict daily schedule.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **near the mean** of the study population. While the disturbed sleep metrics and elevated late-night heart rate deviations suggest potential stressors or physiological strain, these are counterbalanced by strong indicators of psychological well-being, including low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, and moderate happiness. The observed patterns of sleep and physiological arousal, though concerning in isolation, may not translate to a significantly elevated overall stress perception when considered within the broader context of the participant's psychological profile."
84502,"This analysis examines perceived stress through a multimodal lens, integrating self-report, behavioral, and physiological data. The participant's overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the collective data, appears to be **near the population mean**. While specific indicators suggest potential areas of concern, they are balanced by others that point towards a more normalized stress experience.

Several self-report measures indicate a potential for higher perceived stress. The participant reports a PSQI score of 10.0, which is 1.52 standard deviations above the mean, classifying them as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" This is a significant indicator of potential stress, as poor sleep quality is strongly linked to elevated stress levels. Furthermore, the CES-D score of 18.0, while not exceptionally high, is in the upper quartile (0.49 standard deviations above the mean) and is classified as ""Depressed,"" suggesting a potential burden of depressive symptoms that could contribute to perceived stress. Although the STAI–Trait score classifies the participant as ""not anxious"" and is below the population mean (-0.33 standard deviations), the combination of disturbed sleep and depressive symptoms warrants attention.

Conversely, several factors suggest a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports higher than average self-esteem (Score: 41.0, Z-Score: 0.4) and a moderate level of happiness (Current: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53), indicating a positive self-perception and current emotional state. Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage, which is well below the population average, and engages in moderate to high levels of exercise with others (Frequency: ""Three times a week or more"", Z-Score: 1.23), suggesting healthy coping mechanisms. The average resting heart rate is also below the population mean (Value: 52.6, Z-Score: -0.66), which could reflect a more relaxed physiological baseline. The median sleep duration is slightly above average (7 hours 31 minutes, Z-Score: 0.41), which, despite the PSQI classification, suggests a sufficient amount of sleep.

Physiological data reveals a complex daily heart rate pattern. The average heart rate deviation from the mesor shows pronounced positive deviations during late afternoon and early evening hours (e.g., 4-5 PM with a Z-Score of 2.54 and 5-6 PM with a Z-Score of 2.07), suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, significant negative deviations are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM with a Z-Score of -1.76 and 1-2 AM with a Z-Score of -1.57), indicating periods of reduced cardiovascular activity, potentially during sleep. The circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.55, Z-Score: 1.16), are above average, suggesting a relatively regular daily rhythm. The mesor itself is slightly below the population mean (Value: 67.03, Z-Score: -0.94). The Acrophase at ""4:08 PM"" indicates a typical peak time for cardiovascular activity. The overall intradaily variability (Value: 0.55, Z-Score: 0.03) is near the population mean.

In summary, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. While experiencing disturbed sleep and some depressive symptoms, which are significant indicators of potential stress, these are counterbalanced by strong self-esteem, moderate happiness, active social engagement, and a generally regular circadian rhythm. The physiological data suggests periods of heightened arousal in the late afternoon/early evening and reduced activity overnight, which, in conjunction with the reported disturbed sleep, may contribute to the perception of stress. However, the overall picture suggests a perceived stress level that is comparable to the average within the study population."
78783,"The participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. This inference is drawn from several indicators within the self-report surveys and wearable-derived metrics. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, with a z-score of 0.59, indicates disturbed sleep quality, which is a common correlate of elevated stress. Furthermore, the STAI-Trait score of 43.0 (z-score: 0.17) falls within the anxious range, suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety, a state often intertwined with heightened perceived stress. The self-reported happiness score of 2.0 (z-score: -1.61) is significantly below the population mean for happiness, aligning with the notion of increased stress impacting subjective well-being. Conversely, the participant exhibits higher than average engagement in solitary exercise (""Exercised Alone"" frequency z-score: 1.07) and engaging with video games (z-score: 1.71), activities that may serve as coping mechanisms but do not directly mitigate core stressors.

Several wearable-derived metrics also provide insight into the participant's physiological and behavioral patterns that may be indicative of elevated stress. The sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 52 minutes (z-score: -0.39), which is somewhat below average, and a notable variability in sleep start times, with a standard deviation of 173 minutes (z-score: 1.99). This irregularity in sleep patterns, coupled with a higher than average occurrence of daily naps (z-score: 2.23), suggests a disrupted sleep architecture that can exacerbate feelings of stress. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates a moderate level of interdaily stability (z-score: -0.41), suggesting some regularity in daily routines, but the intradaily variability (z-score: 0.24) is slightly elevated. The mean aggregate deviation from mesor shows significant positive deviations in the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: 17.32, 10-11 PM: 16.47), potentially reflecting heightened physiological arousal during these periods. The lower than average resting heart rate (z-score: -0.64) and mesor (z-score: -0.58) might suggest a generally lower baseline cardiovascular activity, but the observed deviations from the mesor, particularly in the evening, are more indicative of acute stress responses or disrupted daily patterns rather than chronic physiological strain.

While some metrics suggest a potentially lower stress profile, they are outweighed by the indicators of elevated stress. The self-esteem score of 39.0 (z-score: 0.11) is at the upper end of the scale, indicating high self-worth, and trust of others is also above average (z-score: 0.83), which are protective factors. Similarly, the participant's academic performance, as indicated by GPA scores ranging from 3.12 to 3.33, appears to be stable and satisfactory. However, the patterns of disturbed sleep, anxious tendencies, and below-average happiness, in conjunction with the physiological markers of disrupted daily rhythm and elevated evening arousal, strongly suggest that this participant is experiencing a relatively high level of perceived stress, likely above the population mean of 21.62 for the Perceived Stress Scale."
25197,"The participant exhibits a profile that suggests a perceived stress level likely above the population mean, with a raw PSS score of 21.61 falling precisely at the study population's mean. However, a closer examination of various self-reported and behavioral metrics indicates a potential upward deviation from this average. Notably, the participant reports higher than average chronic anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 50.0, which is 0.86 standard deviations above the mean. This elevated anxiety score also demonstrates a moderate positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress. While the participant's self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score of -0.53), and their self-esteem is also somewhat lower than the population average (RSES score of 44.0, which is within a typical range but below the ideal 10-40 scale where higher scores indicate greater self-esteem), these do not correlate as strongly with PSS. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep, with a PSQI score of 7.0, classifying their sleep quality as poorer than average and exhibiting a mild positive correlation (0.13) with PSS. Sleep duration is also notably lower than average, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score of -0.77), and greater variability in sleep duration (Z-score of -0.91).

In contrast, certain behavioral and physiological indicators suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant maintains a strong academic record, with recent GPAs consistently at or near 4.0, indicating high performance. They report very low engagement with recreational and non-prescribed drugs, and while they consume alcohol 1-2 times a week, this is within a moderate range. Exercise habits, specifically exercising alone and with others, are reported as 1-2 times a week, which aligns with population norms or slightly above in some instances. Daily recreational habits, such as watching TV/videos/movies, and socializing with friends, are lower than average, which could indicate more time dedicated to other activities or potentially a more introverted or focused lifestyle. Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-score of -0.68). Their circadian rhythm exhibits good stability, with an Interdaily Stability of 0.42 (Z-score of 0.09) and a low Intradaily Variability of 0.47 (Z-score of -0.53), suggesting a regular physiological pattern. The Mesor (average heart rate) is also below the population mean (Z-score of -0.85).

However, the hourly deviation from the mesor in heart rate data reveals periods of significant physiological arousal, particularly during the mid-afternoon, with a pronounced peak at 3-4 PM (Z-score of 5.3) and another notable elevation at 4-5 PM (Z-score of 1.48). These periods of heightened cardiovascular activity, occurring during typical waking hours, could reflect responses to daily stressors or demands. While correlations are generally weak for these hourly deviations, the cluster of positive correlations with PSS during late morning and early afternoon hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM) warrants attention, suggesting that times of lower deviation from the mesor in the early morning might be associated with lower perceived stress, and conversely, higher deviations later in the day might correspond to increased stress.

Overall, while the participant's academic success and lower resting heart rate are positive indicators, the elevated anxiety, poorer subjective sleep quality, and significant physiological arousal peaks during the afternoon suggest a psychological and physiological state that likely contributes to a perceived stress level at or above the population mean. The disturbed sleep patterns and heightened anxiety are particularly salient in the context of perceived stress."
23270,"The participant exhibits a complex profile with indicators suggesting both potentially elevated and lower levels of perceived stress relative to the study population. Self-reported measures indicate a higher proneness to anxiety, as evidenced by a Z-score of 0.56 on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a lower self-reported happiness with a Z-score of 0.55. These findings align with a moderate positive correlation between STAI scores and perceived stress (0.31). Furthermore, the participant's reported CES-D score (11.0) falls within the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a correlation of 0.28 to perceived stress, suggesting a tendency for higher perceived stress to be associated with a slightly greater frequency of depressive symptoms, though not to a clinically significant degree. Conversely, the participant reports high academic achievement with a consistent GPA of 4.0 in the Fall of 2016, and a generally good subjective sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-Score: -1.26) and a ""Good Sleep"" classification. The participant's self-esteem is near the population average (Z-Score: -0.17), and they report high health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.55), which might buffer perceived stress. Behavioral data indicates a high frequency of exercise, particularly sports (Z-Score: 1.58) and exercising alone (Z-Score: 1.07), which are typically associated with lower stress, though a moderate frequency of exercising with others (Z-Score: 0.53) is also reported. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, with significant negative Z-scores, further suggesting lifestyle choices that may mitigate stress.

Physiological data from wearable devices presents a mixed picture. The participant demonstrates robust sleep patterns with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 49 minutes (Z-Score: 2.03), indicating significantly longer sleep than the population average, which generally correlates with lower perceived stress (correlation of -0.04). The mesor, representing the average heart rate around which daily variations occur, is lower than the population average (Mesor Z-Score: -0.61), suggesting a potentially lower baseline cardiovascular load. However, the intradaily variability of heart rate is higher than the population average (Intradaily Variability Z-Score: 0.39), which can sometimes be associated with increased physiological reactivity. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of elevated heart rate during typical waking hours, particularly between 8-9 AM (Z-Score: 1.60) and 9-10 AM (Z-Score: 2.06), and again in the late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z-Score: 1.05). This pattern of heightened arousal during the day, especially during peak academic or social engagement periods, might reflect periods of increased physiological demand or stress response. Conversely, significant negative deviations are observed during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, Z-Score: -1.90; 1-2 AM, Z-Score: -1.23), suggesting periods of significant physiological rest. The overall circadian rhythm measures, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-Score: -0.24) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-Score: -0.03), are near the population mean, suggesting a relatively regular circadian pattern.

Considering the holistic analysis of both self-reported and physiological data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While elevated anxiety (STAI) and lower reported happiness suggest a susceptibility to stress, these are balanced by positive factors such as excellent academic performance, high self-reported health satisfaction, extensive exercise habits, and robust sleep duration. The physiological data, particularly the substantial sleep duration and a mesor heart rate near the population average, are indicative of good physiological regulation. The elevated heart rate deviations during waking hours could reflect periods of increased engagement rather than chronic stress, especially in the context of high academic demands. The participant's overall perceived stress level, therefore, is inferred to be near the population mean (21.62), falling within the typical range observed in the study sample."
70125,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data suggest a state of elevated perceived stress, potentially contributing to a PSS score that would be above the population mean. This inference is supported by elevated scores on the CES-D scale (24.0, Z-score 1.11), indicating a higher burden of depressive symptoms, and the STAI-Trait scale (50.0, Z-score 0.86), reflecting increased proneness to chronic anxiety. While self-esteem is within the population range (39.0, Z-score 0.11), and trust is notably below average (2.33, Z-score -1.74), the combination of depressive symptoms and anxiety is a strong indicator of psychological distress. Furthermore, the participant reports moderate substance usage (Beer and Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week), which can sometimes be a coping mechanism for stress. Daily recreation habits reveal significant internet usage (2-3 hours), which, in conjunction with minimal engagement in reading (Do not do) and sedentary hobbies (15 minutes or less), might suggest a preference for passive or digital forms of engagement over more restorative activities, potentially exacerbating feelings of stress. The PSQI score of 7.0, classified as disturbed sleep, further reinforces the notion of a compromised state, as poor sleep quality is often intertwined with heightened stress levels.

Physiological and behavioral data derived from wearable devices provide additional context. The sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours, which is slightly below the optimal range, and a notably high standard deviation in sleep duration (159 minutes, Z-score 1.32). This variability in sleep, coupled with a median sleep start time in the early morning hours (01:44:30), suggests a disrupted sleep architecture. The circadian rhythm metrics, specifically a lower than average Interdaily Stability (0.34, Z-score -0.57) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.24, Z-score -0.7), point to a less regular and robust daily rhythm. This lack of predictability in daily patterns can be a significant contributor to feelings of stress. While the mesor (70.95, Z-score -0.41) and resting heart rate (53.0, Z-score -0.61) are within normal ranges and even on the lower end, suggesting a relatively good baseline cardiovascular state, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns. Elevated deviations from the mesor are observed during later evening hours (e.g., 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM), with notable peaks, which could indicate periods of heightened physiological arousal or engagement during times typically associated with winding down. Conversely, the early morning hours show significantly negative deviations, which is expected during sleep, but the magnitude of some of these deviations (e.g., 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM) might suggest periods of shallow or disturbed sleep.

Considering the multimodal data, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety, alongside a pattern of disturbed sleep and irregular daily rhythms, strongly suggests a state of heightened perceived stress. The engagement in certain recreational habits and the physiological indicators of disrupted sleep and evening arousal further corroborate this interpretation. Therefore, it is inferred that the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely above the population mean for this study sample."
67192,"The participant's self-reported measures indicate a psychological profile associated with elevated stress. Specifically, the participant reports a high burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 32.0, z-score of 1.95) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 58.0, z-score of 1.65). These scores are substantially above the population means for these measures, as indicated by their positive z-scores. While self-esteem is near the population average (z-score of -0.73), and trust is notably low (z-score of -2.39), the pronounced levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety are significant indicators of psychological distress. Health satisfaction is also reported as low (z-score of -2.03).

Behavioral patterns suggest engagement in sedentary activities and substance use that may be associated with stress. The participant reports spending considerable time watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours daily, z-score of 1.28) and playing video games (1-2 hours daily, z-score of 2.47), with a notable lack of engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is reported at a high frequency (more than 4 hours daily, z-score of 2.53). Regarding substance use, the participant reports consuming wine or liquor 1-2 times a week (z-score of 0.94), while beer and drug use are reported as non-existent. Exercise frequency is moderate, with Exercised Alone and Exercised with Others occurring 1-2 times a week.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal a highly elevated Mesor (mean heart rate) of 88.67 bpm (z-score of 2.01), which is significantly above the population mean. This, along with a higher-than-average resting heart rate (71.8 bpm, z-score of 1.62), suggests a chronically heightened physiological arousal state. The circadian rhythm analysis indicates poor interdaily stability (0.52, z-score of 0.91), suggesting a lack of regularity in daily physiological patterns. While the acrophase (peak heart rate time) is reported at 5:12 PM, the significant elevation in Mesor and resting heart rate, coupled with lower interdaily stability, points towards a dysregulated physiological state. Furthermore, the participant exhibits considerable variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 110 minutes, z-score of 0.59), which, when considered with a disturbed sleep quality classification (PSQI score of 7.0, z-score of 0.13), could further contribute to elevated stress levels.

Considering the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the combination of high self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, elevated resting and mean heart rates, and poor circadian rhythm stability, appears to be significantly above the population mean for the study sample. The elevated CES-D and STAI scores are particularly indicative of heightened psychological distress, which is likely exacerbated by physiological indicators of chronic arousal and potential sleep dysregulation. While some behavioral patterns like high social interaction might be beneficial, the overall constellation of psychological and physiological metrics points to a substantial experience of stress."
97448,"The analysis of perceived stress, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), reveals a complex interplay of self-reported psychological states, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. This conclusion is drawn from a balanced consideration of various indicators.

Several self-report measures suggest a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports a low score on the CES-D scale (3.0, Z-score -1.07), classifying them as ""Not depressed,"" and a similarly low score on the STAI Trait scale (33.0, Z-score -0.82), indicating they are ""not anxious."" Self-esteem is reported at a moderate level (41.0, Z-Score 0.4), and current happiness is also moderate (3.0, Z-Score -0.53). Health satisfaction is also reported as slightly below average (3.67, Z-score -0.45). While trust is relatively high (Score 4.0, Z-Score 1.47), it shows a negligible correlation with PSS. These factors collectively suggest a generally positive psychological outlook and limited internal distress.

Conversely, certain behavioral and physiological data points may suggest potential contributors to perceived stress or indicate less optimal coping mechanisms. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-Score -0.33). While the median sleep duration is within a normal range (7 hours 12 minutes, Z-Score 0.02), the median sleep start time is quite late at 01:44:30. Furthermore, there is a notable pattern of elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 8-10 PM (21.56, Z-Score 2.1; 20.28, Z-Score 2.14) and also significant deviations during the early morning hours (5-8 AM, with values ranging from -28.16 to -26.06). This, coupled with a higher amplitude in heart rate variability (14.78, Z-Score 1.29) and lower interdaily stability (0.53, Z-Score 1.0), suggests a less regular physiological rhythm. Behaviors such as exercising alone with moderate frequency (Three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.07) and infrequent exercise with others (Not at all, Z-Score -1.58) and sports (Not at all, Z-Score -1.09) are observed. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week, which falls in the upper quartile for these behaviors relative to the study population.

Despite the indications of disturbed sleep and certain physiological patterns, the positive self-reported mental health indicators and the overall PSS score being near the population mean suggest that these factors do not translate into significantly elevated perceived stress for this participant. The correlations, while provided, do not overwhelmingly point to a high PSS score when considered holistically. For instance, the positive correlation between STAI and PSS (0.31) is present but not exceptionally strong, and the correlation between CESD and PSS (0.28) is also moderate. The negative correlation between self-esteem and PSS (-0.15) is weak. Conversely, metrics associated with lower stress, like trust, show a very weak negative correlation (-0.04).

In conclusion, the participant’s overall perceived stress level, as inferred from the multimodal data, is assessed as being near the population mean of 21.62. This assessment is based on a balance of positive self-reported psychological well-being, countered by indicators of disrupted sleep and certain physiological patterns that, while not strongly correlated with elevated PSS, suggest potential areas for further investigation into stress management and overall health."
67177,"The participant presents a complex profile with indicators that could suggest both elevated and reduced perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a propensity towards anxiety and depressive symptoms, with a STAI-Trait score of 46 (Z-score 0.46, indicating proneness to chronic anxiety) and a CES-D score of 16, bordering on the threshold for reporting significant depressive symptoms. This is further contextualized by lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) and happiness (Z-score -1.61), and a diminished satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.2). However, a notable protective factor appears to be a generally higher level of trust in others (Z-score -1.1), which positively correlates with lower PSS scores. The participant's academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows a significant decline in the Fall of 2016 (1.9) compared to previous semesters (3.25, 3.38), which may be an external manifestation of underlying psychological distress.

Physiological and behavioral data from wearable devices offer further insight. The participant exhibits a higher than average Mesor (heart rate average, Z-score 1.11) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.84), suggesting a generally elevated baseline physiological arousal. This is accompanied by strong indicators of disrupted daily routines and reduced regularity. Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.24) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.4) are notably high, suggesting a degree of rigidity in daily patterns, which, when combined with other metrics, could reflect a struggle to adapt or maintain consistency. Furthermore, the median sleep duration is 6 hours and 54 minutes, which is below the generally recommended 7-9 hours, and this duration exhibits a negative correlation with PSS scores. The PSQI score of 7, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" also aligns with an increased likelihood of heightened stress.

Conversely, several factors suggest a potential for lower perceived stress. The participant reports no substance usage and a complete absence of structured exercise, which are typically associated with higher well-being and potentially lower stress. Daily recreation habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), as well as consistent internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85). While sedentary, these activities might serve as coping mechanisms. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate is lower than the population average (Z-score -0.74), which could indicate a less erratic physiological response to daily fluctuations, or potentially a blunted response.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While some behavioral patterns, such as the absence of substance use and engagement in passive leisure activities, might typically be associated with lower stress, the presence of chronic anxiety, depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, poor sleep quality, and elevated resting heart rate are more potent indicators of a heightened stress experience. The decline in academic performance further corroborates this inference, suggesting that underlying stressors are impacting functional capacity. The positive correlation of trust with lower PSS scores is a mitigating factor, but it does not appear to outweigh the cumulative evidence of distress."
87328,"This analysis examines multimodal data to interpret the participant's perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. Several indicators suggest a relatively lower perceived stress level. The participant reports very low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 0.0, Z-score of -1.38) and is classified as ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score of 23.0, Z-score of -1.81). Furthermore, self-esteem is reported as high (RSES score of 50.0, Z-Score of 1.66), and the participant reports high current happiness (score of 5.0, Z-Score of 1.64). Health satisfaction is also relatively high (score of 2.67, Z-score of -1.2). This participant reports no substance usage of beer, wine/liquor, or recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drug usage is also absent. Exercise habits include sports participation 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.91), indicating a generally healthy lifestyle. Sleep duration is approximately 7 hours and 25 minutes (Z-score of 0.3), which is slightly above average and associated with a negative correlation to PSS, suggesting better sleep quality may be related to lower stress. The median sleep start time is 01:26:15, with a standard deviation of 50 minutes, indicating a relatively consistent, though late, sleep schedule.

Conversely, certain data points suggest potential indicators of higher perceived stress, although their correlations with PSS are generally weaker or negative. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is 7.0 (Z-Score of 0.13), which falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, indicating subjective sleep quality issues. Wearable data reveals a higher than average mesor (heart rate resting average) of 76.41 bpm (Z-Score of 0.34) and a particularly high amplitude of 16.28 (Z-Score of 1.78), suggesting a wider daily fluctuation in heart rate, which can sometimes be associated with higher physiological arousal. The acrophase (peak heart rate time) is reported as 5:40 PM. The hourly deviation from the mesor indicates heightened cardiovascular activity during the evening hours, particularly between 6-7 PM (deviation of 27.64, Z-Score of 2.62) and 10-11 PM (deviation of 16.11, Z-Score of 1.52). While these late-night elevations could indicate stress, the correlation with PSS is negative for some of these periods. The participant also engages in significant amounts of sedentary activities, including watching TV/videos/movies (3-4 hours, Z-Score of 2.54) and listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-Score of 1.6), which have weak positive correlations with PSS. Furthermore, the participant engages in extensive socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-Score of 2.53), which has a weak positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that while social engagement is high, it may contribute marginally to perceived stress. The 'Interdaily Stability' (Value of 0.53, Z-Score of 1.0) and 'Autocorrelation at 24 Hours' (Value of 0.51, Z-Score of 1.57) are relatively high, indicating regularity in daily rhythms, which generally correlates with lower stress. However, the higher 'Intradaily Variability' (Value of 0.51, Z-Score of -0.25) is a moderate indicator of less consistent daily patterns.

Overall, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by low depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem and happiness, suggests a foundation of low perceived stress. While sleep quality is subjectively reported as disturbed and physiological arousal patterns show some evening elevation, the strong protective factors from self-report measures appear to mitigate a significantly high PSS score. The participant's overall perceived stress level is assessed to be near the population mean."
49497,"The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a relatively high level of perceived stress, potentially placing their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score above the population mean. This inference is supported by elevated scores on measures of psychological distress, including a significantly high CES-D score (Z=3.71), indicating a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, and an elevated STAI-Trait score (Z=2.24), suggesting a proneness to chronic anxiety. Furthermore, the participant's PSQI score of 9.0 is above the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, and their median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes is below average for the study population (Z=-0.85), with a notably high standard deviation in sleep start time (Z=2.65), pointing to irregular sleep patterns. The self-reported happiness score is notably low (Z=-1.61), and self-esteem is below average (Z=-2.28), both of which can be associated with higher perceived stress.

Conversely, certain behaviors and physiological metrics do not strongly align with heightened stress. The participant demonstrates moderate substance usage patterns, with beer and wine/liquor used 1-2 times a week, and recreational and non-prescribed drug usage at frequencies that are not exceptionally high (though recreational drug usage Z-score is significantly elevated, indicating a higher frequency than the population). They also engage in regular exercise, with solo exercise occurring three times a week or more, and participate in sports 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits include moderate internet usage (3-4 hours) and listening to music for a significant portion of an hour, but limited engagement in activities like watching TV/videos, video games, socializing, reading, or sedentary hobbies. Physiologically, the mesor (average heart rate) is close to the population mean, and the resting heart rate is also within a typical range.

However, concerning the circadian rhythm, the interdaily stability of heart rate is low (Z=-1.65), suggesting a lack of regularity in daily physiological cycles. This, combined with an amplitude that is lower than the population mean (Z=-1.56), may indicate a less robust circadian rhythm structure. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows a pronounced dip during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z=0.68; 4-5 AM, Z=0.84; 5-6 AM, Z=0.53), and a sharp increase during late morning (9-10 AM, Z=1.45) and late evening (10-11 PM, Z=1.29), suggesting a disrupted daily pattern of physiological arousal. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also lower than the population mean (Z=-1.03), further indicating reduced daily rhythmicity. The high variability in sleep start times is particularly salient, suggesting that a lack of consistent sleep timing may be contributing to overall stress and potentially impacting circadian regulation.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's psychological distress indicators, coupled with significant sleep disturbances and disrupted physiological rhythmicity, strongly suggest a higher perceived stress level. This participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. The elevated scores on measures of depression and anxiety, combined with poor subjective sleep quality and objectively irregular sleep patterns, are strong predictors of heightened perceived stress. While certain lifestyle habits and physiological measures are not indicative of elevated stress, the prominent distress symptoms and sleep irregularities are more persuasive in this regard."
33785,"The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a relatively elevated level of perceived stress. High scores on the CES-D (27.0, Z=1.42) and STAI (56.0, Z=1.45) scales, indicating significant depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety respectively, correlate positively with perceived stress. These self-reported psychological states are notable given their Z-scores, placing the participant substantially above the mean for these measures within the study population. Furthermore, the participant's daily routine shows high engagement in sedentary activities such as video gaming (1-2 hours, Z=2.47) and other sedentary hobbies (2-3 hours, Z=2.01), which are less strongly correlated with perceived stress but contribute to a pattern of reduced physical activity outside of exercise. The wearable data reveals a significantly low intradaily variability in heart rate (0.25, Z=-2.08), suggesting a less dynamic physiological response to daily environmental changes, which can sometimes be associated with heightened stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data also shows elevated deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 5-6 AM deviation of -23.45, Z=-0.74; 3-4 AM deviation of -19.98, Z=-0.58), potentially reflecting physiological dysregulation or difficulty transitioning through sleep stages. The PSQI score of 7.0 indicates disturbed sleep quality.

Conversely, some factors suggest a lower perceived stress level. The participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Score=32.0, Z=-0.87) and moderate health satisfaction (Score=4.78, Z=0.38), which are negatively and weakly correlated with perceived stress respectively. Trust in others is also near the population mean (Score=3.17, Z=-0.14). The participant engages in regular exercise, specifically exercising alone three times a week or more (Frequency='Three times a week or more', Z=1.07), which is positively associated with lower stress. Sleep duration is within the typical range with a median of 7 hours and 20 minutes, and its standard deviation is only slightly above average. The sleep start time is somewhat variable (Standard Deviation=49 minutes, Z=-0.75), but this variability is not strongly correlated with perceived stress.

Holistically, the constellation of high scores in anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with evidence of disturbed sleep and low physiological variability, strongly suggests that the participant experiences a relatively high level of perceived stress. Despite positive indicators such as good self-esteem and regular exercise, the psychological and physiological markers associated with stress are more pronounced. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean."
33009,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, falling near the population mean for perceived stress. This inference is drawn from a synthesis of self-reported data and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics. While certain indicators suggest potential stress contributors, others point towards adaptive coping mechanisms and generally healthy habits.

Several self-report measures provide insight into the participant's psychological state. The Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 40, while classified as ""anxious,"" is only slightly above the median for the population, indicating a moderate predisposition to anxiety. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7 suggests disturbed sleep, which can be a correlate of stress. However, the participant reports higher self-esteem (score of 40) and a relatively neutral score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), suggesting resilience and a lack of significant depressive symptoms. Trust in others is also relatively high (Z-score of -0.46), potentially indicating a supportive social network. Furthermore, the participant reports moderate usage of alcohol (1-2 times a week for wine or liquor) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are relatively consistent, with reported activity 1-2 times a week for both solitary exercise and exercise with others, and sports participation 1-2 times a month. Daily recreational habits lean towards lower engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV (15 minutes or less) and video games (not at all), while moderate internet usage (1-2 hours) and socializing with friends (1-2 hours) are reported. Reading is engaged in for 15 minutes or less daily, and other sedentary hobbies are also limited. These lifestyle choices, particularly the moderate exercise and social engagement, may serve as protective factors against higher perceived stress.

Physiological data from wearable devices indicate a relatively stable and regular circadian rhythm. The Mesor (average heart rate) of 68.76 bpm, with a Z-score of -0.71, suggests a lower than average resting heart rate, which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular health. The Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also low (-0.92 Z-score), suggesting less extreme diurnal variation in heart rate. Non-parametric measures of circadian rhythm regularity, such as Interdaily Stability (0.35) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.27), are relatively low, indicating less distinct daily patterns in heart rate. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (0.62) is higher, suggesting more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of lower-than-mesor heart rate during the night, particularly between 2-6 AM, with values deviating significantly below the mesor. The hours following waking (7-10 AM) show a gradual increase in heart rate, aligning with expected daily activity patterns. Post-afternoon hours (1-3 PM) and early evening (6-7 PM) show elevations above the mesor, which may correspond to daily activities and engagement. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of approximately 7 hours and 54 minutes, which is generally within healthy ranges, though the standard deviation in sleep duration (55 minutes) is within the average range. The median sleep start time is around midnight, with a moderate standard deviation in start time.

In summary, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean, with specific indicators such as moderate trait anxiety and disturbed sleep quality suggesting some vulnerability. However, these are counterbalanced by indicators of psychological resilience, such as higher self-esteem and the absence of significant depressive symptoms. Furthermore, generally healthy lifestyle habits, including regular, albeit moderate, exercise and social engagement, alongside physiological data suggesting a stable resting heart rate and adequate sleep duration, likely contribute to maintaining a stress level that is not overtly elevated relative to the study cohort."
96184,"The participant exhibits a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is likely near the population mean, considering the provided context. While a direct PSS score is not provided, the aggregated data suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing perceived stress.

Several self-reported survey metrics indicate potential contributors to higher perceived stress. The participant reports a STAI–Trait score of 42.0, which is characterized as ""anxious"" and falls near the population mean (Z-score of 0.07), suggesting a dispositional tendency towards anxiety. This is further supported by a PSQI score of 7.0, indicating ""Disturbed Sleep,"" which is above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and has a positive correlation with PSS scores (though this specific correlation is not provided, the general interpretation of PSQI is relevant). Furthermore, the participant reports listening to music for 1-2 hours, which, while a recreational activity, has a moderate positive Z-score (0.67), potentially reflecting a coping mechanism or a way to manage psychological states. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate, a measure of how much heart rate fluctuates throughout the day, is relatively high (Z-score of 0.39), which can be indicative of a less stable physiological state, potentially associated with increased stress. The participant's sleep duration is notably short, with a median of 5 hours and 27 minutes (Z-score of -2.16), significantly below the population average. This pronounced sleep deficit, coupled with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score of 5.88) and a substantial standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score of 7.44), points to significant sleep disruption and irregularity, which are well-established correlates of elevated stress. The hourly heart rate deviations also reveal a pattern of lower than expected heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM showing Z-scores of 1.33 and 1.16 for deviation from mesor), which could be indicative of sleep fragmentation or difficulty achieving restful sleep.

Conversely, certain indicators suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 8.0, Z-score of -0.55, classified as ""Not depressed"") and a moderate level of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 40.0, Z-score of 0.26), which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Their reported happiness score of 3.0 is below the population mean (Z-score of -0.53), suggesting that happiness may not be a strong buffer for this individual. Notably, the participant reports no substance usage (beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) and limited engagement in sports (frequency of ""Not at all""). Their engagement in sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and video games is also reported as ""Do not do"" or minimal. While these might seem like missed opportunities for stress reduction, their absence suggests a potential lack of engagement in potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms. The participant's Mesor, a measure of the average daily heart rate, is within a reasonable range (Z-score of -1.0), and their resting heart rate is relatively low (Z-score of -0.32), which could indicate a generally good baseline physiological state. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is low (Z-score of -1.48), which may suggest a less pronounced diurnal fluctuation in heart rate, potentially indicating a more stable internal rhythm in some respects. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score of -1.79), indicating weak day-to-day predictability in heart rate patterns, which, while unusual, does not definitively point towards increased stress in isolation.

In summation, the participant's data present a mixed picture. The significant sleep disturbances, coupled with a dispositional tendency towards anxiety, are strong indicators that could contribute to elevated perceived stress. However, the absence of significant depressive symptoms and the presence of moderate self-esteem may offer some resilience. The participant’s overall perceived stress level is inferred to be near the population mean for the study sample."
79395,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile that appears to be associated with a relatively high level of perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CES-D score of 32.0, which is significantly above the population mean and classified as ""Depressed."" Similarly, the STAI-Trait anxiety score of 54.0 suggests a proneness to chronic anxiety, ranking substantially higher than the population average and classified as ""anxious."" These findings are congruent with higher perceived stress, as indicated by positive correlations with PSS in both instances. Furthermore, the participant reports lower levels of self-esteem (Score: 25.0, Z-Score: -1.85) and happiness (Current: 2.0, Z-Score: -1.61), both of which correlate negatively with perceived stress, suggesting these lower scores may contribute to heightened stress perception. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0, while not exceptionally high and close to the population mean (Z-Score: -0.33), still suggests disturbed sleep quality according to the scale's interpretation, which is a common correlate of stress. Behavioral patterns, such as frequent social media usage (Internet Usage: 1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.18) and moderate substance usage (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 0.94), may also be indicative of coping mechanisms related to stress.

Conversely, certain metrics do not strongly suggest high perceived stress. The participant engages in regular exercise, specifically exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-Score: 1.23), which is a positive indicator and shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress. While sedentary habits are present, such as watching TV/videos/movies for extended periods (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: 0.64) and sedentary hobbies (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score: 0.82), the correlation with PSS is negligible. The participant's academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows variability with a dip in Spring 2016 (3.0), but still represents a strong academic standing overall. Physiological metrics from the wearable data present a mixed picture. The mesor (average heart rate) is near the population mean (Z-Score: -0.23), and the amplitude is also close to the population mean (Z-Score: 0.04). The circadian rhythm measures, including interdaily stability (Z-Score: 1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-Score: 1.15), are elevated, suggesting a relatively structured daily rhythm in heart rate, which might typically be associated with lower stress. Sleep duration is near the population mean (Median Sleep Duration: 7 hours 15 minutes, Z-Score: 0.09).

Overall, the evidence points towards the participant experiencing a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. The pronounced elevations in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with lower self-esteem and happiness, are strong indicators of higher perceived stress. While some behavioral and physiological data present a more neutral or even positive picture (e.g., exercise, structured rhythm), these are overshadowed by the significant psychological distress markers. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, though not directly provided, is inferred to be above the population mean of 21.62, suggesting a notable burden of perceived stress within the study sample."
59863,"The participant's self-reported data reveal a psychological profile characterized by relatively high self-esteem and happiness, coupled with low levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, the STAI Trait score of 24.0 is significantly below the typical range for anxiety proneness, and the CES-D score of 5.0 indicates a low burden of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (Score 50.0, Z-Score 1.66) and high current happiness (Score 5.0, Z-Score 1.64), suggesting a generally positive disposition. These factors are associated with lower perceived stress. For instance, happiness demonstrates a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.19) with perceived stress. Academic performance, as indicated by a strong GPA (e.g., 3.82 in Fall 2015), also suggests effective functioning and potentially lower stress. Additionally, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI Score 5.0, Z-Score -0.8) and low health satisfaction (Score 6.0, Z-score 1.3) which might indicate a tendency to downplay minor physical complaints or prioritize well-being, not directly suggesting higher stress, though health satisfaction has a weak negative correlation with perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of physical activity, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-Score 1.07) and exercise with others or sports occurring 1-2 times a week. Daily recreational habits include moderate engagement with watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, with reading for 16-30 minutes (Z-Score 1.3), which has a notable negative correlation with perceived stress (r = -0.21). Substance usage is limited, with beer consumed 1-2 times a week while wine, liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs are not used, generally indicating healthier lifestyle choices that may buffer stress. The limited duration of internet usage and video game time, along with moderate social media engagement, further suggests a balanced approach to digital activities, which could contribute to lower perceived stress.

Physiological data from the wearable devices present a mixed picture regarding stress indicators. The participant exhibits a significantly elevated Mesor (Mean 91.26, Z-Score 2.36), which represents a higher average heart rate relative to the study population, potentially indicative of a more aroused physiological state. This elevated Mesor also shows a slight positive correlation (r = 0.07) with perceived stress. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also moderately high (Z-Score 1.01), suggesting greater daily fluctuation in heart rate. In terms of daily heart rate patterns, the participant shows notable deviations from their mesor during certain hours. Specifically, during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM), there are significant negative deviations from the mesor, implying periods of lower heart rate than average during typical sleep times. Conversely, the hours of 8-9 AM and 9-10 AM show positive deviations, suggesting higher than average heart rate during typical morning wakefulness and activity periods. The increased intradaily variability (Z-Score -1.16), while generally suggesting less regularity in heart rate patterns, is associated with a positive correlation to perceived stress (r = 0.16). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes, which is within a healthy range and shows a slight positive z-score, suggesting potentially good sleep quantity. However, the median sleep start time is approximately 00:38:30, which is relatively late, and the sleep duration standard deviation is within the typical range, not suggesting significant sleep disruption.

Overall, the participant’s self-reported psychological traits and behaviors suggest a generally low perceived stress level, characterized by high self-esteem, happiness, and low anxiety and depression. However, the physiological data indicate a potentially higher basal physiological arousal (elevated Mesor) and some variability in daily heart rate patterns, particularly during sleep and early morning hours. Considering the strong positive indicators from self-report measures, which are directly related to perceived stress, and the mixed but not overwhelmingly negative physiological signals, the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely **near the mean** of the study sample. The PSS population mean is 21.62, with a median of 22.0, suggesting that while some physiological markers might suggest increased arousal, the subjective experience and behavioral patterns point towards a moderate level of perceived stress."
22913,"The participant exhibits several indicators that may suggest a relatively higher perceived stress level. The wearable data reveals a higher than average Mesor (Mean Overall Standard Ellipse in Rhythmometry), indicating a generally elevated baseline heart rate, with a Z-score of 1.81. This is further supported by a higher than population average resting heart rate (Z-score of 0.77). During the daytime, specifically from 10 AM to 3 PM, the participant’s heart rate deviations from the mesor are notably positive and above the population average, suggesting periods of increased physiological arousal. For instance, the 1-2 PM deviation is 14.43, with a Z-score of 1.02. Furthermore, the intradaily variability of heart rate, a measure of irregularity within a day, is significantly lower than the population average (Z-score of -1.80), which could be indicative of a less dynamic or potentially more rigid physiological response pattern that may be associated with stress. Self-reported measures, while not directly pointing to high stress, do show a weak positive correlation between STAI-Trait anxiety scores and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores (0.31), and CES-D depressive symptom scores and PSS scores (0.28), suggesting that even at lower levels, these traits could contribute to perceived stress.

Conversely, several factors indicate a potentially lower perceived stress level. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 5.0 and a corresponding Z-score of -0.8, classified as ""Good Sleep."" The median sleep duration is notably long at 8 hours and 37 minutes, with a Z-score of 1.79, suggesting sufficient restorative sleep, which is generally associated with lower stress. While sedentary habits exist, such as watching TV for 15 minutes or less and playing video games for 15 minutes or less, engagement in other potentially stress-reducing activities like reading and listening to music are reported as ""Do not do."" The participant also reports infrequent substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed only 1-2 times a week, and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Self-esteem is reported at a neutral level (Z-score of -0.03), and happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53). Physical health satisfaction is also near the population average (Z-score of 0.05).

Overall, the participant’s perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While indicators of adequate sleep and generally low levels of depression and anxiety are present, the elevated Mesor and resting heart rate, combined with pronounced positive heart rate deviations during specific daytime hours, suggest a higher physiological arousal and stress response. The lower intradaily variability in heart rate may also contribute to this interpretation, suggesting a less robust capacity to modulate physiological responses, which can be exacerbated under stress. The correlation coefficients, though moderate, do suggest a link between trait anxiety and depressive symptoms with perceived stress."
48969,"This participant presents a complex profile of psychological and behavioral indicators that suggest a potentially elevated level of perceived stress, positioning them above the population mean PSS score of 21.61. Self-report measures highlight significant psychological distress. The participant reports a high frequency of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 42.0 (Z-score: 2.99), classifying them as experiencing a ""Depressed"" state. Furthermore, their trait anxiety is elevated, with an STAI score of 59.0 (Z-score: 1.75), classifying them as ""anxious."" This self-reported anxiety demonstrates a moderate positive correlation (0.31) with PSS scores, reinforcing the interpretation of heightened stress. Concurrently, subjective sleep quality is significantly impaired, evidenced by a PSQI score of 13.0 (Z-score: 2.9), indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" and a strong positive correlation (0.29) with depressive symptoms. While lower self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 22.0, Z-Score: -2.28) and lower self-reported happiness (Current score of 2.0, Z-Score: -1.61) are observed, their correlations with PSS are negative and weak, suggesting these may be consequences rather than primary drivers of perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns further contribute to the perception of elevated stress. The participant exhibits a notable tendency towards sedentary activities and passive entertainment, dedicating more than 4 hours daily to watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score: 3.17), video games (Z-Score: 4.74), and internet usage (Z-Score: 2.19). This is contrasted with minimal time spent socializing with friends (15 minutes or less, Z-Score: -2.2) and no engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. While the participant exercises alone with moderate frequency, they do not exercise with others and engage in sports infrequently, suggesting a potential lack of supportive social or physical outlets for stress management. The limited social interaction, combined with extensive screen time, may contribute to feelings of isolation and increased stress. The participant's GPA averages between 2.25 and 2.59, indicating academic performance that may itself be a source of stress, although the direct correlation with PSS is not provided for GPA.

Physiological data from wearable devices offer additional insights into the participant's stress profile. The participant's resting heart rate is notably higher than the population average, with a Value of 68.55 (Z-Score: 1.24), correlating positively (0.14) with higher PSS. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a distinct pattern of cardiovascular arousal, particularly during the late morning and early afternoon hours, with significant positive deviations from the mesor observed between 11 AM and 1 PM (e.g., 12-1 PM: 11.86, Z-Score: 0.45) and extending into the afternoon (e.g., 4-5 PM: 10.02, Z-Score: 0.18). This heightened physiological activity during waking hours, coupled with a higher resting heart rate, is indicative of sustained sympathetic nervous system activation, a common physiological correlate of stress. While sleep duration is within a reasonable range (Median: 7 hours 51 minutes, Z-Score: 0.84), the significant sleep disturbance reported via the PSQI suggests a qualitative issue with sleep quality rather than quantity, which can exacerbate perceived stress. The observed circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Value: 0.4, Z-Score: -0.08) and intradaily variability (Value: 0.5, Z-Score: -0.32), are within typical ranges, suggesting the underlying circadian system is structured, but the physiological arousal patterns point to a stress-induced disruption in autonomic regulation.

Overall, the confluence of high self-reported depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, limited social engagement, extensive passive screen time, and elevated resting heart rate with increased cardiovascular arousal during waking hours strongly suggests that this participant experiences a relatively high level of perceived stress. This perceived stress level is likely above the population mean PSS score of the study sample."
79731,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted profile with several indicators pointing towards elevated perceived stress. Notably, high scores on the CES-D (Score: 27.0, Z-score: 1.42) and STAI-Trait (Score: 60.0, Z-score: 1.85) scales suggest a significant burden of depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively. These findings are consistent with the elevated PSQI score (Score: 11.0, Z-Score: 1.98), indicating disturbed sleep quality, which often accompanies increased psychological distress. Furthermore, the participant's relatively low self-esteem (Score: 29.0, Z-Score: -1.29) and lower satisfaction with physical health (Score: 2.22, Z-score: -1.53) may contribute to a heightened perception of stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a sedentary lifestyle characterized by a lack of regular exercise, with reported frequencies of ""Not at all"" for Exercised Alone (Z-Score: -1.93), Exercised with Others (Z-Score: -1.58), and Sports (Z-Score: -1.09). This is complemented by extensive internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score: 0.85) and listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-Score: 1.6), which, while potentially adaptive, could also indicate avoidance behaviors. The sleep patterns also present concerning variability, with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Value: 177 minutes, Z-Score: 1.73) and a later median sleep start time (02:58:00), further reflecting potential disruptions to daily rhythm. Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate (Value: 71.2, Z-Score: 1.55) and a higher Mesor (Value: 79.9, Z-Score: 0.81) suggest a generally heightened physiological arousal. The significant deviations from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am: -6.15, Z-Score: 1.61; 4-5am: -7.37, Z-Score: 1.78; 5-6am: -10.51, Z-Score: 1.14) indicate substantial disruptions to typical diurnal heart rate patterns during a period typically associated with deep sleep.

Conversely, some aspects of the data suggest potential coping mechanisms or a baseline resilience. The participant reports moderate levels of socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-Score: 0.16), and moderate consumption of beer and wine or liquor (1-2 times a month for both), which are not extreme. Furthermore, higher reported happiness (Current: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55) and trust of others (Score: 2.83, Z-Score: -0.78) are positive indicators, though their correlations with PSS are relatively weak. The median sleep duration of ""8 hours 17 minutes"" (Z-Score: 1.37) is notably long, suggesting that while sleep timing and consistency are disrupted, the total duration is generally sufficient.

Overall, the convergence of elevated psychological distress indicators (depression, anxiety, poor sleep quality, low self-esteem), sedentary behavior, and disrupted physiological rhythms, particularly during sleep, strongly suggests that the participant experiences a **relatively high PSS score**. Their aggregated physiological and behavioral data reflect a state of heightened arousal and significant internal distress. This participant's **overall perceived stress level is likely above the population mean** of 21.61, given the numerous indicators of distress that deviate significantly from population norms."
64296,"The participant's data suggests a moderate perceived stress level, falling near the population mean. While several indicators point towards lower stress, certain physiological and behavioral patterns warrant consideration.

Indicators of lower perceived stress include generally favorable self-reported mental health and lifestyle metrics. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0, z = -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 35.0, z = -0.62). Self-esteem is above average (SelfEsteem score of 45.0, z = 0.96), and self-reported happiness is notably high (Happy score of 5.0, z = 1.64). Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is good (PSQI score of 5.0, z = -0.8), suggesting subjective sleep is not a significant source of distress. Furthermore, the participant reports no substance usage and engages in limited daily recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, and internet usage, all for 15 minutes or less. They also report minimal solitary exercise. These factors, generally associated with lower perceived stress, are consistent with the moderate overall stress assessment.

Conversely, some physiological and behavioral patterns suggest potential areas of stress or an atypical diurnal rhythm. The participant exhibits a notably higher than average Amplitude (z = 2.7), indicating a larger fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day relative to the mesor. This is accompanied by higher than average Interdaily Stability (z = 1.41) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (z = 1.32), suggesting a more regular, but potentially more rigid, daily pattern of physiological activity. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals significant negative deviations during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am, z = -2.57), suggesting a prolonged period of lower-than-average heart rate during these times, which may reflect deep sleep or a pronounced quiescent state. Sleep duration is slightly below average (Median Sleep Duration of 6 hours 52 minutes, z = -0.4), and the participant's sleep start times are consistently late, with a median start time of 01:07:30. The average daily nap count is zero, which, in conjunction with the shorter sleep duration, might contribute to subjective tiredness or reduced recovery.

In summary, the participant's data presents a complex picture. The strong self-reported indicators of positive mental well-being and healthy lifestyle choices are counterbalanced by physiological patterns that suggest a more pronounced diurnal heart rate variation and slightly reduced sleep duration. Considering the population mean PSS score of 21.62, and this participant's average score falling within the range of typical variation, their overall perceived stress level is inferred to be near the population mean. The observed physiological regularity and amplitude may indicate a well-structured, albeit potentially intense, daily routine that influences cardiovascular patterns, rather than overt signs of high perceived stress."
17569,"This participant's data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely within the average range of the study population. While certain factors may indicate elevated stress, others point towards a more balanced psychological state.

Several indicators suggest a potential for higher perceived stress. The participant reports a PSQI score of 8.0, classifying their sleep as disturbed, which aligns with a Z-score of 0.59, placing them above the population mean for this metric. This subjective sleep disturbance is further supported by the wearable data, which indicates a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 44 minutes, a value with a Z-score of -1.81, significantly below the population mean, suggesting consistently insufficient sleep. Moreover, the participant's mean daily naps are zero, with a Z-score of -0.86, which, while not directly indicative of stress, might reflect a lack of restorative breaks during the day. The higher amplitude (Z-score of 0.91) in their heart rate rhythm may also suggest a greater degree of physiological fluctuation, potentially related to stress responses. Additionally, the participant exhibits a higher than average frequency of beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score of 1.01).

Conversely, several aspects of the data suggest a capacity for managing stress and a generally positive psychological state. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and is classified as ""not anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (score of 38.0, Z-score -0.33). Self-esteem is also within a favorable range, with a score of 43.0 and a Z-score of 0.68. They report high levels of trust in others (score of 3.83, Z-score 1.15) and moderate levels of happiness (current score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53), indicating a potentially robust social and emotional foundation. Furthermore, the participant engages in moderate levels of socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.16). In terms of physiological regularity, the intradaily variability (Z-score 0.46) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.14) suggest a reasonably structured daily rhythm, and the mesor of their heart rate (Z-score -0.65) is below the population mean, indicating a potentially lower average heart rate during periods of rest. Their resting heart rate itself is notably low (47.0, Z-score -1.33), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness.

Considering the totality of these factors, particularly the generally low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with positive self-regard and social engagement, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean for the study sample. While sleep disturbances and occasional alcohol consumption are noted, they do not appear to override the protective psychological factors present."
77036,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a relatively low perceived stress level, as indicated by a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is likely below the population mean of 21.61. This is supported by several indicators. Notably, the participant reports low levels of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score 0.17, which is only slightly above the mean, and a positive correlation with PSS), high self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 38.0, Z-score -0.03), and a generally positive outlook (Happy score of 4.0, Z-score 0.55). Furthermore, the participant reports not experiencing depressive symptoms (CESD score of 8.0, Z-score -0.55) and exhibits low trust in others (Trust score of 3.0, Z-score -0.46), the latter having a negligible correlation with PSS. Health satisfaction is also relatively low (Score of 3.56, Z-score -0.53), but its correlation with PSS is weak. Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in moderate sports activity (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91) but shows very low engagement in most other recreational activities, including exercise, sedentary hobbies, and socializing with friends. Substance usage is also minimal, with no use of wine or liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs.

Conversely, certain physiological and sleep-related metrics hint at potential areas of strain or irregularity that might contribute to stress. The participant exhibits a relatively low median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score -0.41) and a less stable sleep start time (standard deviation of 58 minutes, Z-score -0.55), which is somewhat indicative of disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 6.0, Z-score -0.33, falling within the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification). While the intradaily variability of heart rate is low (Z-score -1.31), suggesting a degree of predictability in hourly heart rate fluctuations, the autocorrelation at 24 hours is notably high (Z-score 2.49), potentially indicating a strong adherence to a daily cycle, but this metric's correlation with PSS is negative, suggesting less stress. The mesor of the participant's heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Mesor of 78.49, Z-score 0.62). Analysis of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. Notably, there are marked negative deviations (indicating lower than average heart rate) during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 am with a deviation of -17.46, Z-score -0.68, and 3-4 am with a deviation of -20.05, Z-score -0.59). In contrast, positive deviations (indicating higher than average heart rate) are observed during morning and afternoon hours, particularly between 8-9 am (deviation of 6.17, Z-score 1.1) and from 2 pm to 6 pm (peak deviation of 10.53 at 3-4 pm, Z-score 0.29), suggesting periods of increased physiological activity, which may align with periods of higher perceived stress or engagement. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is near the population average (Amplitude of 10.92, Z-score 0.04).

Overall, the participant presents with a profile suggesting a lower-than-average perceived stress level, primarily driven by positive self-reported psychological traits and generally healthy lifestyle choices, including limited substance use and moderate engagement in sports. However, this positive outlook is somewhat counterbalanced by suboptimal sleep patterns, characterized by shorter sleep durations and less consistent sleep timing, along with a pattern of increased physiological arousal during waking hours, particularly in the morning and afternoon. Despite these potential stressors, the strong self-reported well-being appears to be the dominant influence on perceived stress. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be below the population mean."
82986,"**Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Analysis: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Insights**

The participant's self-reported data suggests a psychological profile characterized by generally low trait anxiety, a notable absence of depressive symptoms, and high self-esteem. Specifically, the participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI score of 25.0, Z-score of -1.61) and no significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 4.0, Z-score of -0.97). Furthermore, self-esteem is elevated (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 50.0, Z-score of 1.66), and happiness is also reported as high (Current Happiness score of 5.0, Z-score of 1.64). These positive self-assessments are generally correlated with lower perceived stress. However, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality as indicated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 (Z-Score of -0.33), which is above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This finding, alongside a high Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25.79, may suggest potential underlying physiological or lifestyle factors that could influence perceived stress, despite generally positive psychological traits.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, with infrequent engagement in physical activities and social interactions. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs), which are all significantly below the population mean. Exercise frequency is low, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-Score of 0.32) and exercising with others only 1-2 times a month (Z-Score of -0.17), while sports engagement is absent (Z-Score of -1.09). Daily recreation habits are characterized by minimal engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score of -1.25) and listening to music (Z-Score of -1.19). Internet usage is moderate (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score of -0.49), and sedentary hobbies are engaged in for 16-30 minutes (Z-Score of 0.23). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours (Z-Score of 0.16), which is a positive indicator of social connection. Notably, reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-Score of -0.67), a behavior positively correlated with lower perceived stress. The overall pattern of limited physical activity and predominantly passive leisure activities, while not directly strongly correlated with PSS, could contribute to higher stress levels by limiting beneficial coping mechanisms.

Physiologically, the participant's wearable data reveals several patterns, including a significantly shorter median sleep duration and a relatively elevated resting heart rate. The median sleep duration of ""5 hours 6 minutes"" (Z-Score of -2.6) is substantially below the population average, indicating a significant sleep deficit which is often associated with increased perceived stress. The median sleep start time is very late at 02:24:00, and the standard deviation for both sleep duration and start time suggest variability in sleep patterns. The resting heart rate is elevated at 66.8 bpm (Z-Score of 1.03). Circadian rhythm metrics suggest moderate regularity; the interdaily stability of heart rate is below average (Value of 0.33, Z-Score of -0.66), indicating less consistent daily patterns. The intradaily variability is slightly above average (Value of 0.61, Z-Score of 0.46), suggesting some variability in heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor (average heart rate) is also slightly elevated (Value of 79.73, Z-Score of 0.79), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average (Value of 7.55, Z-Score of -1.04), potentially indicating a less dynamic daily physiological cycle. The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal, with periods of higher deviation during the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z-Score 1.51) and some elevated deviations in the late evening (e.g., 10-11 PM, Z-Score 0.71). These physiological indicators, particularly the compromised sleep and elevated resting heart rate, likely contribute to increased perceived stress.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's perceived stress level is likely **above the population mean**. While positive self-reported psychological traits like low anxiety, absence of depression, and high self-esteem would typically suggest lower perceived stress, the significant sleep deficit (median duration of 5 hours 6 minutes), elevated resting heart rate, and general sedentary lifestyle present strong indicators of potential stress. The PSQI score also points to disturbed sleep quality. These physiological and behavioral factors, despite positive self-perceptions, are often associated with higher perceived stress levels in academic settings."
11402,"The participant's perceived stress, as indicated by their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, appears to be above the population mean, which is calculated at 21.62 with a standard deviation of 3.68. Several factors from the self-report surveys and wearable data suggest a higher stress load. Notably, the participant reports a STAI-Trait score of 54.0 (Z-score: 1.25), indicating a proneness to chronic anxiety, which correlates positively with PSS. The CES-D score of 17.0 (Z-score: 0.38) also suggests a notable burden of depressive symptoms, with a positive correlation to PSS. Furthermore, the participant engages in higher-than-average video game usage (Z-score: 2.47) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28), which can be indicative of coping mechanisms or avoidance behaviors often associated with higher stress.

Conversely, some indicators suggest a lower stress experience or potentially resilience factors. The participant's PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.8) is classified as ""Good Sleep,"" suggesting that their subjective sleep quality is relatively good and does not indicate significant sleep disturbance, and this is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Their self-esteem score is at the maximum possible value of 40.0 (Z-Score: 0.26), indicating strong self-worth, which is negatively correlated with PSS. Health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.53) and self-reported happiness (Z-Score: -0.53) are also below average, suggesting these are not areas contributing to higher stress. In terms of substance usage, beer consumption is slightly above average (Z-Score: 1.01), but wine/liquor and recreational/non-prescribed drug usage are not elevated.

Analysis of wearable data reveals additional insights into the participant's physiological patterns. The MESOR of the heart rate is elevated at 83.48 (Z-score: 1.3), suggesting a higher baseline cardiovascular activity compared to the population. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a relatively low interdaily stability (Value: 0.37, Z-Score: -0.33) and very low intradaily variability (Value: 0.34, Z-Score: -1.45), implying a less structured daily rhythm in heart rate. The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows a pronounced elevation in heart rate during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 7-8 PM: 17.2, Z-score: 0.99; 8-9 PM: 12.29, Z-score: 0.47), and also during early morning hours (1-2 AM: 4.74, Z-score: 1.77; 2-3 AM: -2.8, Z-score: 1.38), which may indicate disrupted sleep or heightened physiological arousal during these periods. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 19 minutes (Z-Score: -1.07), which is below the population average and associated with a higher standard deviation in sleep duration and sleep start time. The high Z-scores for sleep start time standard deviation (1.14) and median sleep start time (03:17:50) suggest considerable irregularity in sleep timing.

In conclusion, while the participant reports good subjective sleep quality and high self-esteem, the combination of elevated chronic anxiety, depressive symptoms, irregular sleep patterns, and certain physiological arousal patterns (particularly during nighttime and early morning hours) strongly suggests a higher perceived stress level. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**."
38610,"The participant exhibits a multifaceted profile that suggests a moderate to high level of perceived stress, likely falling near the population mean for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This inference is drawn from a combination of self-reported psychological states, behavioral patterns, and physiological indicators derived from wearable data.

Several self-reported measures point towards potential contributors to higher perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively low level of happiness (Z-score of 1.64), which correlates negatively with PSS scores, indicating that lower happiness may be associated with higher stress. While classified as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" on the CES-D and STAI-Trait scales, respectively, their Z-scores are notably below the mean (-1.07 and -1.31), suggesting a comparatively lower burden of these symptoms within the study sample, which could indirectly buffer stress. Conversely, the participant's self-esteem score is notably high (Z-score of 1.66), correlating negatively with PSS, suggesting higher self-esteem may be protective against stress. Health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z-score of 1.13), correlating negatively with PSS, indicating better health satisfaction may be linked to lower stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score falls near the population mean (Z-score of 0.13), indicating disturbed sleep, a known correlate of increased stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular exercise, particularly exercising with others (Z-score of 1.23), and engages in moderate internet usage. However, significant limitations are observed in daily recreational habits that are typically associated with stress reduction. Notably, the participant reports ""Do not do"" for watching TV/Videos/Movies (Z-score of -1.25) and reading (Z-score of -0.67), and spends very limited time socializing with friends (Z-score of -1.41). These reduced engagement in potentially restorative activities could contribute to higher perceived stress. Substance usage, including beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is consistently low (Z-scores ranging from -0.31 to -0.55), suggesting that substance use is not a primary coping mechanism for stress in this individual.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals patterns consistent with elevated physiological arousal, particularly during daytime hours, and a disrupted sleep architecture. The participant's resting heart rate is above the population mean (Z-score of 1.14), and the mesor (circadian rhythm midpoint) is also elevated (Z-score of 1.14). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant deviations from the mesor, particularly during the late morning and early afternoon. For instance, the 9-10 AM period shows a large positive deviation (12.47, Z-score 1.23), and several daytime hours exhibit positive deviations greater than 2 Z-scores from the mesor. This suggests a generally heightened physiological state throughout the day. Furthermore, the sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score of -1.76), which is significantly shorter than the population average and suggests chronic sleep deprivation, a strong predictor of perceived stress. The median sleep start time is very late at 02:39:15 AM, with a moderate standard deviation in sleep start time, implying irregularity in sleep timing. The circadian rhythm metrics show relatively low interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.33) and moderate intradaily variability (Z-score of 0.32), suggesting a less regular daily pattern. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z-score of -0.36), further indicating a disrupted circadian rhythm.

In summary, the combination of low happiness, disturbed sleep quality, and limited engagement in restorative activities, alongside elevated resting heart rate and potentially disrupted daily physiological rhythms, suggests that the participant experiences a relatively high level of perceived stress. Given the population statistics for the PSS, it is estimated that this participant's overall perceived stress level is likely **above the population mean**. While the participant displays high self-esteem and health satisfaction, which may offer some resilience, the cumulative evidence points towards a significant stress burden."
96610,"The participant's self-reported data and wearable metrics suggest a moderate level of perceived stress, likely falling near the population mean. While several indicators point towards lower stress, some aspects of daily routine and physiological regulation are slightly elevated.

**Indicators of Lower Perceived Stress:**

The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z-score -1.18) and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 25.0, Z-score -1.61), both of which are strong indicators of a less stressed psychological state. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is relatively high (Score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), and health satisfaction is also notably high (Score 7.0, Z-score 2.05). Subjective well-being and satisfaction with physical health are positively associated with lower perceived stress. Notably, substance usage across all categories (Beer, Wine or Liquor, Recreational Drugs, Non-prescribed Drugs) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with corresponding low Z-scores, indicating a lack of engagement in these potentially stress-associated behaviors. Engagement in sports is also relatively high (Frequency '1-2 times a week', Z-score 0.91), which is generally associated with positive psychological outcomes.

**Indicators of Potentially Higher Perceived Stress:**

Despite the generally positive self-reports, certain physiological and behavioral metrics hint at areas that might contribute to perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) indicates disturbed sleep, exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is further supported by a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes, which is below the typical recommended duration for adults and has a negative Z-score (-0.37), suggesting shorter sleep than the population average. The average sleep start time is quite late (01:21:29), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is also relatively high (48 minutes, Z-score -0.77), suggesting some irregularity in the sleep schedule.

The participant's circadian rhythm analysis reveals a higher Mesor (mean heart rate) (Value 80.72, Z-score 0.92) and amplitude (Value 13.98, Z-score 1.03) compared to the study population, indicating a generally higher daily heart rate and a greater fluctuation around this higher baseline. This elevated cardiovascular activity, particularly during waking hours, could be indicative of increased physiological arousal. While the acrophase (peak of heart rate rhythm) is around 4:20 PM, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows significant positive deviations from the mesor during mid-afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM: 14.71, 3-4 PM: 16.37) and early evening (e.g., 6-7 PM: 15.49). These periods of elevated heart rate might correlate with daily stressors or demanding activities. Conversely, the mean aggregate deviation from mesor during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-6 AM) shows consistently negative values, suggesting a reduced heart rate during these times, which could be reflective of attempts to wind down. The intrady variability of heart rate is slightly lower than the population average (Value 0.51, Z-score -0.25), which might indicate less pronounced minute-to-minute fluctuations in heart rate, but this needs to be considered alongside other metrics.

**Holistic Conclusion:**

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While the absence of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, coupled with high happiness and health satisfaction, are strong indicators of resilience and lower perceived stress, the objective data highlights challenges in sleep quantity and regularity, as well as a slightly elevated physiological arousal pattern throughout the day. These physiological and sleep metrics, despite generally positive psychological self-reports, suggest that the participant may experience periods of moderate stress, particularly related to sleep disturbance and the physiological demands of their daily routine, which likely balance out the positive self-assessments. The participant's overall perceived stress level is likely **near the mean** of the study sample."
77711,"The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a moderate level of perceived stress, likely situated near the population mean. While subjective reports on anxiety (STAI score of 52.0, Z-score 1.06) are elevated, suggesting a tendency towards trait anxiety, other self-report measures paint a more balanced picture. The CES-D score is 13.0, indicating no significant depressive symptom burden, and self-esteem is relatively high with a score of 28.0 (Z-score -1.43). Furthermore, health satisfaction (Z-score -0.62) and trust (Z-score -0.78) are also below the population average, which might correlate with reduced stress. The PSQI score of 7.0 classifies as disturbed sleep, which often accompanies stress, but this is relatively close to the population mean (Z-score 0.13).

Behavioral patterns present a mixed reflection of stress. The participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a month for both beer and wine/liquor), no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and engages in moderate physical activity (exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week). However, the engagement in sports is low (less than 1-2 times a month). Notably, the participant dedicates significant time to sedentary activities, particularly listening to music (3-4 hours daily, Z-score 1.6) and watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours daily, Z-score 1.28), while reading is not a reported habit. This high engagement in passive leisure activities could be a coping mechanism for stress or indicative of a less active lifestyle.

Physiological and circadian data from wearable devices offer further insights, largely aligning with a moderate stress profile. The participant's resting heart rate is relatively low (Value 52.4, Z-score -0.68), suggesting a good baseline physiological state. The Mesor (Value 68.84, Z-score -0.7) and Amplitude (Value 10.52, Z-score -0.08) of the heart rate rhythm are below population averages, indicating a potentially less robust cardiovascular response. Circadian rhythm stability, as measured by Interdaily Stability (Value 0.34, Z-score -0.57), is lower than average, suggesting some irregularity in daily patterns. Sleep duration is slightly below average (6 hours 55 minutes, Z-score -0.33) with increased variability in sleep start times (Z-score -0.62), consistent with the disturbed sleep classification from the PSQI. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day, with significant elevations in deviation from the mesor during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 11 am - 12 pm, Z-score 1.25; 1 pm - 2 pm, Z-score 1.65; 2 pm - 3 pm, Z-score 1.59), which could reflect periods of increased cognitive demand or environmental stimulation. Conversely, heart rate is generally lower than the mesor during the late evening and early morning hours.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean for the study sample. While some metrics like low resting heart rate and lower than average self-esteem might suggest lower stress, the elevated trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, and the significant engagement in passive leisure activities, coupled with a below-average interdaily stability in heart rate rhythm and periods of elevated heart rate deviation during active hours, collectively point towards a perceived stress level that is likely higher than the average participant in the study. The positive correlations observed between higher PSS scores and measures of anxiety, and the negative correlations with self-esteem, further support this conclusion."
17020,"The participant's self-reported perceived stress, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (mean population PSS: 21.61, SD: 3.68), appears to be **near the mean** of the study sample. While the specific PSS score is not provided, the combination of other self-report and physiological measures offers insights into factors that may contribute to this level of perceived stress.

Several self-report measures suggest a potentially lower level of perceived stress. The participant reports not being depressed (CES-D score of 10.0, Z-score -0.34), with a positive correlation (0.28) between CES-D and PSS, indicating that lower depressive symptoms are associated with lower PSS. Similarly, their self-esteem is within a healthy range (SelfEsteem score of 40.0, Z-score 0.26), and while the correlation with PSS is weakly negative (-0.15), it aligns with the general expectation that higher self-esteem may be associated with lower stress. Happiness levels are also relatively high (Happy score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53), with a weak negative correlation (-0.19) to PSS, suggesting that greater happiness is associated with lower perceived stress. Trust in others is also near average (Trust score of 3.17, Z-score -0.14), with a negligible correlation to PSS (-0.04). Health satisfaction is somewhat lower than average (Health Satisfaction score of 3.22, Z-score -0.78), with a weak negative correlation (-0.07) to PSS.

Conversely, certain factors may indicate a contribution to moderate or potentially higher perceived stress. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score of 7.0, Z-score 0.13), which is a known correlate of increased stress. Their trait anxiety is classified as ""anxious"" (STAI score of 40.0, Z-score -0.13), with a positive correlation (0.31) to PSS, suggesting that higher levels of chronic anxiety are linked to higher perceived stress. In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85) which shows a positive correlation (0.1) to PSS, suggesting that more time spent online is associated with higher perceived stress.

Wearable data provides further context regarding physiological regulation and behavior patterns. The participant exhibits a lower than average Mesor (mean heart rate around which circadian rhythm oscillates) (Mesor value of 59.63, Z-score -1.95), which could indicate a generally lower baseline heart rate. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate is higher than average (Intradaily Variability value of 0.64, Z-score 0.67), with a positive correlation (0.16) to PSS, suggesting that greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day is associated with higher perceived stress. The participant's resting heart rate is also lower than average (Resting Heart Rate value of 48.2, Z-score -1.18), with a positive correlation (0.14) to PSS, suggesting that lower resting heart rate is associated with higher perceived stress in this sample. Sleep duration is near the population average (Median Sleep Duration of 7 hours 7 minutes, Z-score -0.08), with a weak negative correlation (-0.05) to PSS, indicating that average sleep duration is associated with lower perceived stress. However, the Sleep Duration Standard Deviation is slightly above average (Value of 108 minutes, Z-score 0.17), and shows a positive correlation (0.14) to PSS, suggesting that greater variability in sleep duration is associated with higher perceived stress. The median sleep start time is notably late (02:12:45), and while its direct correlation to PSS is moderate (0.17), this late schedule may disrupt circadian regularity.

Overall, the data suggests a participant experiencing moderate perceived stress, falling around the study population's mean. While indicators of positive psychological well-being such as higher happiness and self-esteem are present, these are counterbalanced by concerns related to anxious predispositions and disturbed sleep patterns. The higher intradaily variability in heart rate and the late sleep schedule are notable physiological and behavioral patterns that may contribute to this perceived stress level."
29885,"The analysis of the provided data indicates a participant whose perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), is likely above the population mean. This inference is supported by several self-reported survey metrics and wearable-derived physiological data. Notably, the participant reports a CES-D score of 17.0 (Z-score 0.38), classifying them as experiencing ""Depressed"" symptoms, with a moderate positive correlation (0.28) to PSS. Similarly, the STAI-Trait score is 43.0 (Z-score 0.17), indicating proneness to ""anxious"" feelings, also with a positive correlation (0.31) to PSS. The PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) signifies ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and while its direct correlation to PSS is not explicitly provided, subjective sleep quality is frequently linked to heightened stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits relatively low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.73), which is negatively correlated (-0.15) with PSS, suggesting lower self-esteem might be associated with lower perceived stress. However, higher self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) is negatively correlated (-0.19) with PSS, suggesting that this specific measure might not directly align with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also relatively low (Z-score 0.97), with a weak negative correlation (-0.07) to PSS.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a higher frequency of exercise, including exercising alone and with others (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), and participates in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91). This engagement in physical activity, particularly with others (correlation -0.02), shows a slight negative association with PSS. Substance usage, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported as 1-2 times a week (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94), with minimal correlation to PSS. Recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as ""Not at all."" Daily recreational habits show moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with higher time spent listening to music (Z-score 0.67) and socializing with friends (Z-score 0.16). Notably, reading time is minimal (Z-score 0.32), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.21) to PSS. Sedentary hobby time is significantly high (Z-score 1.41), with a weak negative correlation (-0.05) to PSS.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals aspects of disrupted circadian rhythm and heightened arousal. The Interdaily Stability is high (Value 0.53, Z-score 1.0), suggesting a regular daily pattern, yet the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours is also high (Value 0.45, Z-score 1.06), indicating some robustness in the daily cycle. However, the Intradaily Variability is low (Value 0.43, Z-score -0.81), implying less fluctuation within the day. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated above the population mean (Value 76.44, Z-score 0.34), and the Amplitude is notably high (Value 14.65, Z-score 1.25), suggesting a wider range of heart rate fluctuations throughout the day, which can be indicative of stress. The Acrophase occurs in the late afternoon/early evening (5:17 PM). Resting Heart Rate is lower than the population mean (Value 53.2, Z-score -0.59). The Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor reveals significant deviations. Notably, the period between 3-4 AM and 4-5 AM shows the largest negative deviations (-26.31 and -26.72 respectively, Z-scores -1.58 and -1.43), indicating unusually low heart rates during these late-night/early-morning hours, potentially reflecting deep sleep or periods of inactivity. Conversely, there are significant positive deviations in the late evening, particularly between 9-10 PM (Value 18.9, Z-score 1.9), suggesting heightened physiological arousal during this time. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes (Z-score -0.31), which is slightly below average, and a relatively low Sleep Duration Standard Deviation (35 minutes, Z-score -1.5), suggesting consistent, albeit shorter, sleep. The median sleep start time is late (1:57 AM), with a standard deviation of 35 minutes (Z-score -1.06), indicating a consistent but delayed sleep schedule.

In summary, the participant exhibits characteristics associated with higher perceived stress, including elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, disturbed sleep, and significant physiological arousal patterns characterized by late-night peaks in heart rate deviation from mesor. While the participant engages in exercise and has a relatively stable daily structure (high Interdaily Stability), the combined picture from self-report and physiological data, particularly the elevated amplitude and late-evening heart rate deviations, points towards a perceived stress level above the population mean of 21.62. The presence of ""Depressed"" and ""anxious"" classifications, coupled with disturbed sleep and late-night arousal, suggests the participant is experiencing a greater degree of perceived stress compared to the average in the study population."
79167,"The participant exhibits a complex profile of behaviors and physiological indicators that, when considered holistically, suggest a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. Several self-report measures indicate generally positive psychological states and healthy lifestyle choices. For instance, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0, z-score of -1.07), indicating a low burden of these symptoms in the past week. Similarly, the STAI-Trait anxiety score of 24.0 (z-score of -1.71) suggests a low propensity for chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is notably high, with a score of 47.0 (z-score of 1.24), and self-reported happiness is also elevated (current score of 5.0, z-score of 1.64). Health satisfaction is also high, with a score of 7.0 (z-score of 2.05), and the PSQI score of 5.0 (z-score of -0.8) indicates good subjective sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant engages in frequent exercise, with frequency reported as ""Three times a week or more"" for exercising alone (z-score of 1.07), with others (z-score of 1.23), and in sports (z-score of 1.58). Substance usage is moderate, with beer and wine or liquor consumed ""1-2 times a week."" Daily recreational habits are characterized by relatively low engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less, z-score of -0.62), video games (does not play, z-score of -0.56), and internet usage (does not do, z-score of -2.5). Reading is done for 15 minutes or less (z-score of 0.32), and time spent socializing with friends is 1-2 hours (z-score of 0.16). These self-reported data points collectively suggest a foundation of well-being and proactive engagement in health-promoting behaviors.

However, several wearable-derived metrics and some self-reported survey correlations point towards potential areas of increased stress. The participant's circadian rhythm analysis reveals an intradaily variability of 0.65 (z-score of 0.74), which is higher than the population average, suggesting less regularity in daily physiological patterns. The mesor (average heart rate around the midpoint of the daily rhythm) is relatively low at 67.99 (z-score of -0.81), and the amplitude (the extent of variation in heart rate throughout the day) is also low at 7.58 (z-score of -1.03). This combination of a low mesor and low amplitude, alongside higher intradaily variability, could indicate a less robust circadian system that may struggle to maintain stable physiological rhythms. While sleep duration is good (median of 8 hours 11 minutes, z-score of 1.25), the sleep start time is relatively late (median of 23:31:40) and the standard deviation for sleep start time is 65 minutes (z-score of -0.39), suggesting some irregularity in sleep timing. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor during specific periods. Notably, the 6-7 AM hour shows a substantial positive deviation of 5.15 (z-score of 3.07), and the 7-8 AM hour shows a deviation of 12.42 (z-score of 2.69), indicating heightened physiological arousal during these early morning hours, which is atypical. Conversely, late evening hours (e.g., 12-1 AM with -11.77 deviation, z-score of -1.42; 1-2 AM with -14.17 deviation, z-score of -0.91; 2-3 AM with -18.64 deviation, z-score of -0.85) show marked decreases from the mesor, potentially reflecting periods of low activity or wakefulness before sleep. Correlations with PSS are also observed. While not override the holistic analysis, it is notable that STAI-Trait anxiety has a moderate positive correlation (0.30) with PSS, suggesting that even though the participant's reported trait anxiety is low, higher anxiety may be associated with higher perceived stress. Similarly, Interdaily Stability (a measure of circadian rhythm regularity) shows a negative correlation (-0.13) with PSS, and Amplitude shows a negative correlation (-0.18), implying that less regular circadian rhythms and lower heart rate variability might be associated with increased perceived stress.

In summation, while the participant presents with many indicators of well-being, including low depression and anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, good health satisfaction, and frequent engagement in exercise, the presence of a less stable circadian rhythm (indicated by higher intradaily variability and lower amplitude), atypical early morning physiological arousal, and correlations suggesting that less regular physiological patterns are associated with higher stress contribute to an overall impression of a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. The participant's PSS score is therefore likely to be above the population mean of 21.65."
22455,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely **near the population mean** for PSS. Several factors indicate a potential for higher perceived stress, while others point towards lower stress levels, creating a balanced overall impression.

Factors suggestive of higher perceived stress include a relatively high frequency of watching TV/videos/movies (3-4 hours, Z-score 2.54) and internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.52), alongside listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.6). These extended durations in sedentary, potentially passive recreational activities may correlate with reduced engagement in other behaviors. Notably, the participant reports exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) but exercises with others not at all (Z-score -1.58), indicating a potential deficit in social support through shared physical activities. The measured **Interdaily Stability** of heart rate (Value: 0.3, Z-score: -0.9) is below average, suggesting less regularity in daily behavioral patterns, which can be associated with increased stress. The **Median Sleep Duration** is 6 hours and 7 minutes (Z-score: -1.33), which is notably shorter than average and could contribute to perceived stress. Furthermore, the **Amplitude** of the circadian rhythm derived from heart rate data is relatively low (Value: 6.07, Z-score: -1.52), potentially indicating a less robust daily physiological cycle.

Conversely, several indicators suggest factors that may buffer or reduce perceived stress. The participant reports a low CES-D score (12.0, Z-score: -0.14), indicating minimal depressive symptoms, and a low STAI–Trait score (28.0, Z-score: -1.31), signifying low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Score: 46.0, Z-Score: 1.1), and current happiness levels are also elevated (Current Happiness: 5.0, Z-Score: 1.64). The participant exhibits a high level of health satisfaction (Score: 6.89, Z-score: 1.96). Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, with notably low Z-scores for beer (-1.12) and wine or liquor (-1.3). The **PSQI score** is 5.0 (Z-Score: -0.8), classifying sleep quality as ""Good Sleep"" and suggesting no significant sleep disturbance. The **Mesor** of the heart rate data (Value: 66.33, Z-score: -1.04) and **Resting Heart Rate** (Value: 53.8, Z-score: -0.52) are below the population mean, indicating a generally lower baseline physiological arousal. Sleep start times are also relatively consistent, with a **Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation** of 66 minutes (Z-score: -0.37).

The overall pattern of results suggests a participant who experiences low levels of trait anxiety and depression, with good self-esteem and happiness, and high health satisfaction. While extended engagement in passive leisure activities and shorter sleep duration may contribute to some stress, these factors appear to be counterbalanced by intrinsic psychological resilience and lower physiological arousal, placing their perceived stress level near the population mean."
57443,"The participant presents a complex profile with indicators suggesting both elevated and diminished perceived stress levels when examined across multiple data modalities. Self-reported measures indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 19.0, Z-score of 0.59) and a slightly higher-than-average self-reported happiness score (Current Happiness score of 4.0, Z-score of 0.55). Trait anxiety (STAI score of 40.0, Z-score of -0.13) falls near the population average, as does self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 39.0, Z-Score of 0.11). Notably, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality as indicated by a low PSQI score (5.0, Z-Score of -0.8), suggesting potentially effective coping mechanisms or a resilient psychological state in this domain. Furthermore, the absence of reported substance usage and a generally low frequency of exercise (Exercised Alone 1-2 times a month, Exercised with Others 1-2 times a month) could reflect deliberate lifestyle choices that may contribute to lower stress, although low engagement in physical activity might also be a consequence of higher stress.

Conversely, certain physiological and behavioral metrics suggest potential drivers of increased perceived stress or a lack of restorative patterns. The participant's average heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates significantly elevated arousal during the afternoon and early evening hours, particularly between 1 PM and 3 PM (e.g., 1-2 PM: 16.36, Z-score 1.38; 2-3 PM: 15.56, Z-score 1.58) and also between 6 PM and 9 PM (e.g., 6-7 PM: 18.72, Z-score 1.08; 7-8 PM: 15.49, Z-score 0.69). These periods of increased cardiovascular activity during times that are typically associated with lower physiological demand could indicate a response to internal or external stressors. The mesor itself (80.19, Z-score 0.85) is also elevated, suggesting a higher baseline heart rate. While sleep duration is close to the population mean, the standard deviation of sleep duration (42 minutes, Z-score -1.33) is notably low, indicating highly consistent sleep patterns which, in this context of elevated heart rate deviations, could reflect a rigidity rather than a healthy regularity. The circadian rhythm metrics, specifically a lower interdaily stability (0.5, Z-score 0.75) and a relatively higher intradaily variability (0.55, Z-score 0.03), suggest a less robust daily rhythm in heart rate patterns.

Considering the combined evidence, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, appears to be above the population mean. While good subjective sleep quality and a generally stable (though not exceptionally high) self-esteem and anxiety proneness are positive indicators, the marked elevations in heart rate during specific afternoon and evening periods, coupled with a higher overall mesor and less stable circadian rhythm, strongly suggest physiological underpinnings associated with elevated stress reactivity. The moderate depressive symptomology also aligns with a higher stress burden. The observed patterns of increased physiological arousal during potentially non-stressful times are more indicative of a heightened stress response than mitigating factors."
94579,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral factors that likely contribute to their perceived stress level. Self-reported measures indicate a notable elevation in depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 24.0, placing them in the ""Depressed"" classification and demonstrating a Z-score of 1.11, suggesting a burden of depressive symptoms above the study population mean. Concurrently, their score on the STAI-Trait anxiety scale is 44.0, with a Z-score of 0.27, indicating a slightly elevated propensity for chronic anxiety relative to the sample. Conversely, self-esteem (RSES score of 37.0) and perceived trust (score of 3.0) are within or slightly below the typical range for the population, with Z-scores of -0.17 and -0.46, respectively. Subjective health satisfaction is moderate, with a score of 5.0 and a Z-score of 0.55, indicating satisfaction above the population mean in this domain.

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant reports engaging in regular physical activity, with exercise frequencies of ""Three times a week or more"" for exercising alone (Z-score of 1.07), exercising with others (Z-score of 1.23), and participating in sports (Z-score of 1.58). These high frequencies of exercise, particularly sports, are notable. Daily recreational habits suggest moderate engagement with passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (16-30 minutes, Z-score of 0.01) and internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.18). They also dedicate significant time to listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score of 1.13) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95). A particularly pronounced habit is reading, with a substantial 2-3 hours dedicated daily (Z-score of 4.24), suggesting a strong inclination towards solitary, cognitive leisure activities. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported at very low frequencies, below 1-2 times a month or ""Not at all,"" with corresponding negative Z-scores indicating less than average usage within the sample.

Physiological and sleep data reveal several patterns potentially influencing perceived stress. The participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours and 38 minutes, with a Z-score of -0.69, indicating a shorter sleep duration than the average in the sample. This is further evidenced by a high standard deviation in sleep duration (3.21 Z-score) and sleep start time (1.54 Z-score), suggesting considerable variability and potential irregularity in sleep patterns. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows distinct periods of deviation from the mesor. Notably, significant negative deviations, indicative of lower-than-average heart rate, are observed during the late-night and early morning hours (e.g., -22.85 at 5-6 AM, Z-score -0.65; -19.22 at 3-4 AM, Z-score -0.46). Conversely, positive deviations, indicating higher-than-average heart rate, are present during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 15.43 at 10-11 AM, Z-score 1.51; 13.28 at 2-3 PM, Z-score 1.15). This pattern suggests a potential disruption in the typical diurnal heart rate variation. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate relatively stable interdaily stability (0.49, Z-score 0.67), suggesting some regularity in daily patterns, but a moderate intradaily variability (0.52, Z-score -0.18). The mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly below the population average (71.99, Z-score -0.27), and the resting heart rate is also close to the population mean (57.6, Z-score -0.07).

Considering these multimodal data points, the participant's perceived stress level (PSS) appears to be **above the population mean**. The elevated CES-D score indicative of depressive symptoms, combined with slightly elevated anxiety (STAI-Trait), and notably irregular and shorter sleep duration, are strong indicators of heightened perceived stress. While high engagement in exercise and reading might serve as coping mechanisms, their presence alongside the aforementioned psychological and sleep disturbances suggests they may not be fully mitigating underlying stressors. The physiological data, particularly the significant deviations from the mesor during critical sleep and wakeful periods, further supports a state of physiological dysregulation that is often associated with elevated stress. The substantial sleep duration standard deviation and sleep start time standard deviation, in particular, suggest a lack of consistent sleep hygiene, which is a common contributor to increased perceived stress."
29257,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a tendency towards lower perceived stress, positioning them below the population mean for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This inference is supported by a confluence of self-report measures and certain physiological indicators. Notably, the participant reported very low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 2.0, Z-score of -1.18) and anxiety (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score of -1.02), both of which are generally associated with lower stress. Furthermore, their self-esteem score is above average (SelfEsteem score of 46.0, Z-score of 1.1), a trait often protective against high stress. Subjective health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction score of 5.22, Z-score of 0.72) is also relatively high, indicating a positive perception of their physical well-being, which can contribute to lower stress.

In terms of lifestyle and daily habits, the participant exhibits behaviors that may mitigate stress. They report moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score of 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a month, Z-score of 0.19), with no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits, while not exceptionally frequent (Exercised Alone: 1-2 times a week, Exercised with Others: 1-2 times a week), are present, though participation in sports is notably absent (Sports: Not at all, Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational habits show a preference for extended periods of listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score of 2.06), while time spent on activities like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage is relatively low. Engagement in sedentary hobbies and reading is minimal.

Wearable data reveals some interesting patterns related to circadian rhythm and heart rate variability. The participant demonstrates a relatively low Interdaily Stability (Value of 0.26, Z-score of -1.23) and moderate Intradaily Variability (Value of 0.46, Z-score of -0.6), suggesting a less structured daily rhythm in their heart rate, which can sometimes be associated with higher stress. However, their Mesor (Value of 72.96, Z-score of -0.13) and Amplitude (Value of 8.46, Z-score of -0.75) are within population norms, and their resting heart rate (Value of 59.2, Z-score of 0.12) is average. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a noticeable pattern of lower heart rate deviations from the Mesor during nighttime hours (e.g., 2-3 AM: -6.07, 3-4 AM: -8.78, 4-5 AM: -11.18) and elevated deviations during late morning and afternoon hours (e.g., 10-11 AM: 4.98, 12-1 PM: 10.56, 4-5 PM: 10.84), aligning with typical daily activity patterns rather than indicating chronic physiological dysregulation.

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (7 hours 49 minutes, Z-score of 0.79) but a greater than average variability in sleep duration (151 minutes, Z-score of 1.14). The median sleep start time is late (01:32:30), with average variability. The absence of reported naps suggests no significant disruption in the sleep-wake cycle in that regard. While the sleep duration variability and late start time might suggest some potential for stress, the overall picture, particularly the low scores on anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, and moderate exercise, points towards a generally lower perceived stress level compared to the study population. The participant's estimated PSS score appears to be below the population mean of 21.62."
49539,"The participant exhibits a pattern of behavioral and physiological metrics that suggest a perceived stress level near the population mean. While several indicators point towards a moderate stress experience, the absence of significant distress symptoms and the presence of some positive lifestyle indicators temper concerns of elevated stress.

Several factors are suggestive of moderate perceived stress. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0, while categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" is only slightly above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and falls within a Z-score of -0.33 relative to the study population, indicating only a mild deviation towards poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a high intradaily variability (Z-score: 2.01), suggesting a more fragmented or irregular daily physiological rhythm, which can be associated with increased stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates periods of marked deviation from the mesor, particularly during the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 11 PM - 12 AM: 35.55, Z-score: 4.79; 3 AM - 4 AM: -22.65, Z-score: -1.0), which could reflect heightened physiological arousal or stress response during these times.

Conversely, several factors indicate a potentially lower or well-managed stress experience. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.07) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score: -1.81), both well below the population mean. Self-esteem scores are slightly above average (Z-Score: 0.96), and self-reported happiness is near the mean (Z-Score: -0.53), with modest negative correlations to perceived stress. The participant also reports no substance usage and infrequent exercise outside of sports (frequency: ""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score: 0.91), which are generally considered protective factors against stress. Sleep duration is near the population mean (Median Sleep Duration Z-score: 0.18), although sleep start times show some variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.96), and daily naps are absent (Mean Daily Naps Z-score: -0.86). The mesor (heart rate amplitude) is below the population mean (Z-score: -1.57), and the resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score: -1.23), which could indicate good cardiovascular health and potentially a lower physiological stress load.

Holistically, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While there are indicators of physiological irregularity and slightly disturbed sleep quality, these are counterbalanced by robust mental health indicators, a slightly higher than average self-esteem, and no substance usage. The academic performance, as indicated by the upward trend in GPA across semesters, further suggests a capacity to manage academic demands. The PSS score itself, while not explicitly provided, can be inferred to be within the average range based on the presented data."
63904,"This participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile with notable indicators of elevated perceived stress, particularly in relation to psychological well-being and certain physiological patterns. Self-reported data reveal significantly elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 30.0, Z-score of 1.74) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 53.0, Z-score of 1.16), both of which correlate positively with perceived stress (CES-D: 0.28, STAI: 0.31). Furthermore, self-reported happiness is notably low (Current happiness score of 2.0, Z-score of -1.61), with a negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.19), suggesting that lower happiness is associated with higher stress. While the participant reports a relatively neutral overall satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction score of 3.44, Z-score of -0.62), their Body Mass Index (BMI) of 24.89 falls within the overweight category.

Several behavioral and physiological metrics also suggest potential contributors to or manifestations of higher stress. The participant exhibits significantly reduced sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration of 5 hours 49 minutes, Z-score of -1.69) and a higher standard deviation in sleep duration (30 minutes, Z-score of -1.61), indicating considerable sleep fragmentation. Their circadian rhythm exhibits reduced interdaily stability (Value of 0.53, Z-score of 1.0), suggesting less consistent daily patterns. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate reveals substantial deviations from the mesor during the late evening and early morning hours, particularly between 2-3 AM and 5-6 AM, where the mean deviation is notably negative (e.g., -21.9 at 5-6 AM), suggesting a blunted or altered cardiovascular response during typical rest periods. The high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value of 0.45, Z-score of 1.06) in heart rate data, alongside the reduced interdaily stability, could imply a disrupted circadian system.

Conversely, certain factors suggest a potential buffer against perceived stress or an absence of significant stressors in these domains. The participant reports high levels of trust in others (Trust score of 2.17, Z-score of -2.07), which correlates minimally with perceived stress (-0.04). Their self-esteem is also relatively high (Self-Esteem score of 30.0, Z-Score of -1.15), correlating negatively with perceived stress (-0.15), which would typically be protective. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, and exercise frequency, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports, is also reported as ""Not at all,"" indicating a lack of substance-related stressors and also potentially a lack of stress-mitigating physical activity. Similarly, daily recreation habits are notably low for most activities except for internet usage (2-3 hours) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours), the latter of which may offer a positive coping mechanism. Their sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is not significantly disturbed (Score of 6.0, Z-Score of -0.33).

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, appears to be **above the population mean**. This inference is primarily driven by the significant elevations in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with notably poor and irregular sleep patterns and disruptions in physiological rhythmicity, which are robust correlates of higher perceived stress. While factors like high trust and self-esteem may offer some resilience, the magnitude of distress indicated by the psychological and sleep metrics suggests a substantial perceived stress burden that surpasses the average levels observed in the study sample."
20335,"This analysis synthesizes self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological data to assess perceived stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The participant's PSS score, while not directly provided, can be inferred from its correlation with other metrics.

**Indicators of Potentially Higher Perceived Stress:**

Several data points suggest a profile potentially associated with higher perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively high amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score: 0.64) and significantly higher than average time spent playing video games (Z-Score: 1.71) and listening to music (Z-Score: 1.13). Additionally, a substantial amount of time is dedicated to sedentary hobbies (Z-Score: 2.01). While socializing with friends is also high (Z-Score: 1.74), the overall pattern of passive or solitary leisure activities could be indicative of coping mechanisms or a reduced engagement with more physically or socially demanding stressors. Furthermore, the participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours and 35 minutes, which is below the population average (indicated by a negative Z-score of -0.74). Sleep start times exhibit notable variability, with a standard deviation of 27 minutes (Z-Score: -1.24), suggesting potential disruption in sleep schedules. The physiological data reveals elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor during late evening hours (e.g., 10-11 PM, Z-Score: 1.14; 11 PM-12 AM, Z-Score: 1.53) and particularly during the early morning hours (12-1 AM, Z-Score: 3.66), which could reflect physiological arousal or stress response patterns that extend into the night. The intraday variability of heart rate is also notably high (Z-Score: 0.81), suggesting less stable physiological regulation throughout the day.

**Indicators of Potentially Lower Perceived Stress:**

Conversely, several factors suggest a profile that may be associated with lower perceived stress. The participant reports very low levels of substance usage for beer (Z-Score: 0.3) and wine or liquor (Z-Score: 0.94), and no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, aligning with lower risk behaviors that can be linked to stress management. The participant also demonstrates a strong engagement with physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-Score: 1.07), which is a known protective factor against stress. Self-reported measures of mental health are generally positive: a low CES-D score (2.0, Z-Score: -1.18) indicates minimal depressive symptoms, and a low STAI score (23.0, Z-Score: -1.81) suggests low chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is reported as high (Z-Score: 1.66), and happiness levels are also above average (Z-Score: 1.64). Health satisfaction is also rated favorably (Z-Score: 1.3). The PSQI score of 5.0 suggests ""Good Sleep"" according to the classification, and the circadian rhythm metric of Interdaily Stability is relatively high (Z-Score: 1.33), indicating a degree of regularity in daily routines as reflected in heart rate patterns. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly above the population average (Z-Score: 0.57), which, in conjunction with the Amplitude, could suggest a generally more active physiological state.

**Holistic Interpretation:**

The data presents a complex profile with competing indicators of perceived stress. While the participant exhibits several positive psychological and behavioral indicators (low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise, and low substance use), there are notable physiological and sleep-related signals that may point to underlying stress. The late-night and early-morning heart rate elevations, coupled with shorter and less consistent sleep durations, could be indicative of a compromised stress response or an inability to fully disengage from stress during periods of rest. The significant time spent in sedentary activities and passive leisure, despite regular exercise, may also be a factor.

**Overall Perceived Stress Level Comparison to Population Mean:**

The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While specific PSS scores are not provided, the combination of relatively short and disturbed sleep, along with elevated heart rate deviations during the night and early morning, alongside a strong preference for sedentary leisure activities, suggests a higher stress burden compared to peers. This is further supported by the general positive trend in self-report measures like low anxiety and depression, which can sometimes mask underlying physiological stress responses in individuals who are otherwise functioning well."
35031,"The participant’s data suggests a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean. This assessment is based on a combination of self-reported psychological measures, behavioral patterns, and physiological data derived from wearable devices. While some indicators may suggest moderate stress, others point towards lower stress levels, resulting in an overall impression of being within the typical range observed in the study sample.

Several self-reported survey scores indicate a potentially lower stress profile. The participant reported a CES-D score of 6.0, classified as ""Not depressed,"" with a corresponding Z-score of -0.76, suggesting a lower frequency of depressive symptoms than the average study participant. Similarly, the STAI Trait score of 27.0, classified as ""not anxious"" and with a Z-score of -1.41, indicates a low proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem, measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, was reported at 43.0 with a Z-score of 0.68, suggesting a higher-than-average level of self-worth. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, was 5.0, falling into the ""Good Sleep"" classification and yielding a Z-score of -0.8, indicating a relatively positive subjective sleep experience. Furthermore, measures of trust (Z-score: -0.46) and happiness (Z-score: -0.53) also suggest a slightly more positive disposition than the average. These findings collectively point towards a participant who generally experiences positive psychological states and lower levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology.

In contrast, certain behavioral and physiological metrics might suggest potential areas of elevated stress or suboptimal regulation. The participant's wearable data reveals several metrics indicative of less robust circadian rhythmicity and potentially higher physiological arousal. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -1.81) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: -1.87) are notably low, suggesting a less regular daily rhythm. Intradaily Variability is comparatively high (Z-score: 1.16), indicating greater fluctuations in physiological signals throughout the day. The Mesor of 82.2 (Z-score: 1.13) and Resting Heart Rate of 75.5 (Z-score: 2.06) are both above the population mean, potentially indicating higher baseline physiological activity. The Amplitude of 5.05 (Z-score: -1.85) is low, which, in conjunction with a high Mesor, might suggest a flattened but elevated daily heart rate pattern. The analysis of Mean Aggregate Deviation from Mesor shows higher positive deviations during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 11 PM - 6 AM), which could reflect a period of physiological activation during what might typically be a rest period, although the sleep start time is late. Sleep duration (8 hours 3 minutes, Z-score: 1.08) is slightly above average, but the deviation from the mesor analysis during late night/early morning might suggest disrupted sleep quality or timing. Moreover, the participant engages in moderate substance usage (Beer and Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), and spends a notable amount of time watching TV/Videos/Movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95). These activities, while not inherently indicative of stress, represent significant time allocation and could reflect coping mechanisms or leisure pursuits that may or may not be stress-mitigating.

Considering the balance of evidence, the participant’s self-reported psychological well-being, characterized by low anxiety and depression and high self-esteem, suggests a strong internal resilience that likely mitigates potential stressors. However, the physiological data, particularly concerning circadian rhythm regularity and elevated resting heart rate, points to potential physiological challenges that could contribute to perceived stress. The observed deviations in heart rate during the night, coupled with a high Mesor and resting heart rate, might indicate an underlying physiological state that is more reactive or less regulated. Nevertheless, the positive self-reports on subjective well-being and sleep quality suggest that these physiological patterns may not be translating into a significantly elevated perceived stress experience. Therefore, the participant’s overall perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean, benefiting from robust psychological resources despite some physiological indicators that might suggest a greater predisposition to stress."
88185,"The provided data suggests a participant experiencing a moderate level of perceived stress, appearing to be slightly above the population mean. This is primarily supported by several key indicators. The participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes, which is below the optimal range and exhibits a negative Z-score (-0.7), indicating shorter sleep than the population average. This, coupled with a notable PSQI score of 6.0, classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and exceeding the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, strongly points towards sleep-related factors contributing to heightened perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.33), suggesting a highly regular daily schedule, which can sometimes be associated with inflexibility and difficulty adapting to stressors.

Conversely, several factors suggest a lower perceived stress level or protective psychological resources. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score -0.66, ""Not depressed"") and low trait anxiety (STAI score of 29.0, Z-score -1.22, ""not anxious""). Their self-esteem score (44.0, Z-score 0.82) is above average for the sample. The participant also reports high levels of happiness (Current score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), which is a significant positive indicator. Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent exercise alone (Frequency ""Three times a week or more"", Z-score 1.07) and spends a substantial amount of time listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95), all of which are generally associated with positive well-being and stress reduction. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, which is a favorable behavioral pattern.

The participant's average perceived stress level, inferred from the integration of these factors, appears to be slightly above the population mean. While positive psychological traits and beneficial lifestyle behaviors are present, the pronounced indicators of disturbed sleep quality and duration, combined with a high degree of daily routine stability, suggest an underlying susceptibility to stress that may be impacting their overall perceived stress. The correlations provided indicate a tendency for shorter sleep duration and higher intredaily variability to be associated with higher PSS scores, further supporting the interpretation of disturbed sleep as a contributor to elevated perceived stress in this participant."
35344,"The participant presents with elevated scores across several psychological and behavioral measures that correlate with perceived stress. Notably, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 62.0 indicates a significantly higher proneness to chronic anxiety (Z-score of 2.05), which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). Similarly, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 28.0 suggests a substantial burden of depressive symptoms in the past week (Z-score of 1.53), also showing a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 indicates disturbed sleep quality (Z-score of 1.05), which is a common correlate of stress and may further contribute to the participant's overall perceived stress. Self-reported happiness is notably low at 2.0 (Z-score of -1.61), with a moderate negative correlation to perceived stress (-0.19), suggesting that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. While self-esteem is within the average range (27.0, Z-score of -1.57), its weak negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.15) suggests it may offer some buffer.

Physiological data from wearable devices provide further insight into potential stress-related patterns. The average resting heart rate is 63.8 bpm (Z-score of 0.67), which is slightly above the mean for the study population. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a mesor (average daily heart rate) of 78.01 bpm (Z-score of 0.56) and an amplitude of 11.25 bpm (Z-score of 0.15), indicating a moderately regular circadian pattern in heart rate. However, the interdaily stability of heart rate is 0.44 (Z-score of 0.25), suggesting a degree of inconsistency in daily rhythmicity, which has a negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.12). Conversely, intradaily variability is 0.56 (Z-score of 0.1), suggesting a moderate level of within-day fluctuations in heart rate, with a positive correlation to perceived stress (0.16). The mean aggregate deviation from the mesor highlights periods of elevated heart rate during the late morning and afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM with a deviation of 12.35, Z-score 1.06; 3-4 PM with a deviation of 12.88, Z-score 0.72; and 4-5 PM with a deviation of 13.28, Z-score 0.67), which might reflect periods of increased physiological arousal or stress response during these times. Sleep duration data indicates a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 47 minutes (Z-score of 0.74), which is slightly longer than average and shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.05), suggesting it may not be a primary contributor to higher stress. However, the median sleep start time of 00:03:03, with a standard deviation of 61 minutes, indicates some variability in sleep timing.

The participant's overall perceived stress level, inferred from the combination of elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep quality, and specific physiological patterns, appears to be above the population mean. The average PSS score for the study population is 21.61, with a median of 22.0. The participant's strong scores on measures of anxiety (STAI) and depression (CES-D), alongside a PSQI score indicative of disturbed sleep, collectively suggest a subjective experience of stress that is likely higher than what is reported by the average participant in this study. While certain behavioral habits, such as moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine/Liquor usage of 1-2 times a week) and regular exercise (alone three times a week or more), might offer some resilience, the combination of psychological distress and sleep disturbances points towards a higher overall perceived stress level relative to the population."
31175,"This participant exhibits a complex profile in relation to perceived stress, with several indicators suggesting a potentially elevated level, while others point towards a more moderate experience. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) population mean is 21.61, with a standard deviation of 3.68. The participant's self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is 40.0, placing them within the ""anxious"" classification and correlating positively with PSS. This suggests that higher chronic anxiety proneness is associated with higher perceived stress. Similarly, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, indicative of disturbed sleep, also exhibits a positive correlation with PSS, further suggesting a link between poor sleep quality and higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports frequent beer and wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week), with notably high Z-scores for Beer usage (1.01) and Wine or Liquor usage (0.94), which may be indirectly related to stress coping mechanisms. The participant also demonstrates high engagement in solitary recreational activities like watching TV/Videos/Movies (1-2 hours daily) and listening to music (2-3 hours daily), and a strong preference for exercising alone (""Three times a week or more""). In contrast, the participant shows a very low frequency of exercising with others (""Not at all,"" Z-score -1.58). This pattern of solitary engagement in both recreation and exercise might reflect a preference for independent coping strategies that could be associated with higher perceived stress, especially when combined with other indicators.

Several physiological and behavioral metrics, however, suggest aspects that might be associated with lower perceived stress. The participant's sleep duration is notably long, with a median of 9 hours and 34 minutes, reflected in a high Z-score of 2.96 for sleep duration. This robust sleep pattern, alongside a relatively stable sleep start time standard deviation (84 minutes, Z-score 0.03), points towards a well-regulated sleep schedule which is generally protective against stress. Their resting heart rate (57.8 bpm, Z-score -0.04) is near the population mean, and the Mesor (64.59, Z-score -1.28) is also on the lower side, indicating generally lower baseline cardiovascular arousal compared to the study population. The low value for Intradaily Variability (0.3, Z-score -1.73) in heart rate suggests a more stable and predictable daily physiological rhythm, which is often associated with lower stress. While the mesor is lower, the amplitude (8.28, Z-score -0.81) is also on the lower side, suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The Acrophase occurring at 3:34 PM suggests the peak heart rate occurs in the afternoon. The participant reports high happiness (Current score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), which is inversely correlated with PSS, suggesting that greater self-reported happiness is associated with lower perceived stress. Additionally, the participant's overall health satisfaction score is relatively high (5.11, Z-score 0.63), which, although weakly correlated with PSS, generally aligns with lower stress.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While indicators such as robust sleep duration, lower resting heart rate, and high happiness are suggestive of resilience and lower stress, these are counterbalanced by elevated anxiety, reported disturbed sleep quality, and patterns of solitary engagement in activities that may not be strongly buffering stress. The positive correlations observed between STAI and PSQI scores with PSS lend significant weight to the interpretation that heightened anxiety and poor sleep quality are contributing factors to their perceived stress levels. The substantial positive Z-scores for beer and wine/liquor usage, alongside the high engagement in solitary leisure activities, might suggest coping mechanisms that are not fully mitigating underlying stress."
58793,"The participant's data suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing their perceived stress, leaning towards a higher overall stress level than the study population. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) mean for the study population is 21.62, with a standard deviation of 3.68. While the exact PSS score for this participant is not provided, the aggregated behavioral and physiological data warrants careful interpretation.

Several indicators point towards a potentially elevated perceived stress. The participant reports experiencing chronic anxiety, with a Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 46.0 (Z-score: 0.46), placing them within the higher range of anxiety proneness. This is further supported by a relatively high ""Mesor"" value of 79.55 (Z-score: 0.77) derived from cosinor analysis of their heart rate data, indicating a higher average heart rate throughout the day compared to the population. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is also elevated at 13.88 (Z-score: 1.0), suggesting greater physiological fluctuation. More specifically, the ""Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor"" data reveals significant periods of elevated heart rate relative to the mesor, particularly between 8-9 AM (Z-score: 3.52), 2-3 PM (Z-score: 2.03), and 4-5 PM (Z-score: 2.0). These pronounced deviations, especially during typical daytime hours, can reflect periods of heightened physiological arousal, potentially associated with stressful events or a general state of alertness that contributes to perceived stress. Additionally, the ""Autocorrelation at 24 Hours"" value of 0.45 (Z-score: 1.06) indicates a stronger day-to-day similarity in heart rate patterns, which in conjunction with other metrics, may signify a less adaptable physiological response.

Conversely, certain metrics suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports excellent subjective sleep quality, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.8), classified as ""Good Sleep."" This is a significant positive indicator, as good sleep is typically associated with lower stress levels. Their median sleep duration is also notably long at 9 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score: 2.3), exceeding typical recommendations and suggesting ample rest. Furthermore, the participant engages in frequent social activities with friends (3-4 hours per day, Z-score: 1.74), a behavior strongly associated with positive mental well-being and stress reduction. Their self-esteem is also relatively high, with a score of 33.0 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z-Score: -0.73). Additionally, their high GPA (average 3.76 across semesters) suggests academic success, which can be a buffer against stress. Their health satisfaction score (6.0, Z-score: 1.3) is also above average, indicating a positive outlook on their physical health.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While strong indicators of good sleep, high self-esteem, and robust social engagement are present, the elevated heart rate deviations during key daytime hours, coupled with higher average heart rate (Mesor) and amplitude, and the presence of chronic anxiety, suggest that these positive factors may not be entirely counteracting significant physiological and psychological stressors. The notable elevations in specific hourly heart rate deviations, particularly during the latter half of the day, are compelling indicators of physiological strain that likely contribute to a higher subjective experience of stress."
96689,"The participant’s psychological profile suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely near the population mean. This inference is supported by several indicators. The STAI-Trait score of 47.0 (Z-score: 0.56) indicates a propensity towards higher chronic anxiety, which positively correlates with perceived stress. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-score: -0.33) classifies as disturbed sleep, and the data on sleep duration variability (Z-score: -1.42) and sleep start time consistency (Z-score: -1.19) reveal a marked irregularity in sleep patterns. This physiological dysregulation, particularly in sleep architecture, is often associated with elevated stress responses. Conversely, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Score: 39.0, Z-Score: 0.11) and happiness (Z-Score: -0.53), along with a low CES-D score (Score: 6.0, Z-score: -0.76) indicating minimal depressive symptoms, which may act as a buffer against higher stress levels. Health satisfaction is notably low (Score: 2.11, Z-score: -1.61), which, while not directly correlated with PSS, might reflect an underlying concern or dissatisfaction that contributes to perceived stress.

Analysis of the wearable data provides further insight into the participant's physiological state and its relationship with perceived stress. The circadian rhythm metrics reveal a relatively regular pattern, evidenced by an Interdaily Stability Z-score of 0.75, suggesting consistent daily activity patterns. However, the Intradaily Variability Z-score of 0.74 and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score of 0.98 indicate higher than average variability within the day and a weaker 24-hour rhythm, which could be indicative of stress-related physiological dysregulation. The Mesor of 77.78 (Z-score: 0.52) and Amplitude of 14.98 (Z-score: 1.36) are both above the population mean, suggesting a higher baseline heart rate and a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate, respectively, which can be associated with increased physiological arousal and stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 2-7 AM), with notably low values (e.g., -20.28 to -24.78). These deep troughs in heart rate during the typical sleep period might reflect periods of very low arousal, potentially disturbed sleep, or uncharacteristic cardiovascular activity during these times. Conversely, the participant exhibits elevated heart rate deviations during the evening hours (e.g., 6-11 PM), with values ranging from 5.26 to 21.88, suggesting increased physiological arousal during these periods. The Acrophase at 5:14 PM points to the peak of this daily heart rate cycle occurring in the late afternoon.

Behavioral habits do not strongly indicate elevated perceived stress. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for all categories, and exercise frequencies are notably low (""Not at all"" for Exercised Alone, Exercised with Others, and Sports). Daily recreation includes moderate internet usage (1-2 hours), and significant social interaction with friends (2-3 hours), alongside limited time spent on sedentary hobbies and reading. These behaviors, particularly higher social engagement, do not align with a profile of high avoidance or withdrawal often seen with elevated stress. The negative correlation of social interaction with PSS score (0.06), and reading with PSS score (-0.21), coupled with a low self-reported happiness score, suggest that while social connection is present, it may not be fully mitigating underlying stress. Overall, the data suggests a participant with a generally stable personality, experiencing some physiological dysregulation related to sleep and heart rate patterns that may contribute to a perceived stress level near the population average."
33657,"The participant presents with a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that is likely near the population mean, considering the available data. While specific PSS score data is not directly provided, several indicators suggest a moderate level of perceived stress. The participant's CES-D score of 16.0 (Z-score: 0.28) indicates a level of depressive symptoms that is slightly above the population mean, and shows a positive correlation with PSS, suggesting that higher depressive symptom burden is associated with increased perceived stress. Conversely, the STAI-Trait score of 37.0 (Z-score: -0.43) indicates a relatively low level of chronic anxiety proneness, which is generally associated with lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is reported at a score of 41.0, which is slightly above the typical range and shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, suggesting higher self-esteem might be associated with lower stress. Happiness is reported at a Z-score of 0.55, indicating a moderately high level of happiness, which generally correlates with lower perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Z-score: 0.22) with a weak negative correlation to PSS.

Behavioral habits suggest some lifestyle choices that could influence stress levels. The participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (Beer: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01; Wine or Liquor: 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.94), with weak negative and positive correlations to PSS, respectively. Notably, the participant engages in substantial sedentary hobby time (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 3.19), which shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, potentially indicating that this activity may serve as a coping mechanism. However, significant time is also spent on internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85) and listening to music (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.21), which have weak positive correlations with PSS. Conversely, sports participation is notably low (Not at all, Z-score: -1.09) with a weak negative correlation to PSS.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal patterns that may reflect stress. The participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (Value: 51.2, Z-score: -0.83) and a low Mesor (Value: 63.24, Z-score: -1.46), suggesting a generally lower cardiovascular baseline. However, the intradaily variability of heart rate is high (Value: 0.65, Z-score: 0.74), which shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS, indicating more fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, a potential marker of stress reactivity. The pattern of mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows marked increases in heart rate during late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11am, Z-score: 2.71), which are hours with moderate positive correlations to PSS, suggesting heightened physiological arousal during these periods. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score: -0.13) which is close to average, and a moderate number of daily naps (Value: 0.26, Z-score: 2.23) with a weak positive correlation to PSS, suggesting that more frequent napping could be associated with higher perceived stress. The PSQI score of 6.0 (Z-score: -0.33) suggests disturbed sleep, which is positively correlated with PSS. Overall, the combination of slightly elevated depressive symptoms, high intradaily heart rate variability, and disturbed sleep quality points towards a moderate level of perceived stress, likely near the population mean."
36117,"The participant's psychological and behavioral data suggests a perception of stress that is **above the population mean**. This inference is supported by several indicators, particularly within the self-reported survey data and wearable-derived physiological metrics. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, though not explicitly provided, can be inferred to be elevated due to the confluence of other data points. The participant exhibits a notably high score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with a Z-score of 0.59, classifying their sleep quality as disturbed. This aligns with a moderate CES-D score of 16.0 (Z-score 0.28), indicating a degree of depressive symptom burden, and a relatively high engagement in internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and socialising with friends (Z-score 2.53), potentially reflecting coping mechanisms or time allocation that could be influenced by stress.

Further evidence for elevated perceived stress can be observed in the wearable-derived metrics. The participant's average resting heart rate (Z-score 1.65) is significantly higher than the population average. This elevated physiological arousal is also reflected in the circadian rhythm metrics, with a higher Mesor (Z-score 2.04) and Amplitude (Z-score 1.58), suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates higher than average heart rate elevations during the late afternoon and evening hours, specifically between 6 PM and 10 PM (e.g., 7-8 PM: Z-score 0.95, 8-9 PM: Z-score 1.02). This pattern, combined with a lower than average Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.94) in heart rate, may suggest a less dynamic physiological response pattern, potentially indicative of sustained arousal or difficulty in returning to a resting state, which are often associated with higher stress levels.

Conversely, some data points suggest factors that might mitigate perceived stress or indicate a baseline level of well-being. The participant reports a moderate score on the STAI-Trait scale for anxiety (Z-score -0.33), suggesting chronic anxiety levels are not elevated. Furthermore, their GPA scores across academic terms are consistently strong, indicating academic success, and their self-esteem score (Z-score 0.96) is also within a positive range. They engage in regular exercise with others (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23), a behavior often linked to stress reduction, and their consumption of alcohol is moderate. The median sleep duration is also slightly above average (Z-score 0.58), although the overall quality of sleep is rated as disturbed. Despite these positive indicators, the preponderance of evidence, particularly the disturbed sleep, elevated resting heart rate, and pronounced evening heart rate elevations, points towards a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean."
92515,"The participant's perceived stress level, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), appears to be **above the population mean**. This conclusion is supported by an aggregation of self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics.

Several indicators suggest a relatively higher perceived stress level. The participant reports a median sleep duration of 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is significantly below the population average, as evidenced by a Z-score of -1.58. Furthermore, their self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" with a score of 6.0. While subjective happiness scores are relatively high (Z-score of 1.64), this may reflect a tendency to downplay negative affect. A higher than average Z-score for trust (0.83) could also reflect an attempt to foster positive social interactions, potentially as a coping mechanism for underlying stress. The higher frequency of consuming wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) and a moderate frequency of beer consumption (1-2 times a month, Z-score 0.3) also align with patterns sometimes seen in individuals managing stress. Notably, a greater proportion of social interaction with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62) compared to other leisure activities could indicate a reliance on social support.

Conversely, some data points suggest potential buffers or factors that might mitigate perceived stress. The participant maintains a perfect GPA across multiple semesters, indicating academic success, and their self-esteem score is within the average range (Z-Score 0.4). Their CES-D score (4.0) is classified as ""Not depressed,"" and their STAI-Trait score (36.0) indicates they are ""not anxious,"" suggesting a generally stable psychological disposition. Regarding physical health, their Body Mass Index (18.99) is on the lower end, and their health satisfaction score is above average (Z-score -0.78). In terms of exercise, they engage in moderate frequency of exercising with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53) and sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91). The wearer-derived metrics show a relatively regular circadian rhythm, with an interdaily stability of 0.42 (Z-score 0.09) and intradaily variability of 0.53 (Z-score -0.11), and a mesor (72.24, Z-score -0.23) and amplitude (9.67, Z-score -0.36) that are within the population norms. The participant also exhibits a lower than average autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.41, Z-score 0.73), suggesting a less rigid daily structure.

Overall, the most salient indicators of elevated perceived stress stem from the consistent and significant sleep deprivation. The substantial deviation from typical sleep duration, coupled with a subjective classification of disturbed sleep, strongly suggests a physiological and psychological burden. While other psychological and behavioral factors present a more mixed picture, the fundamental disruption in sleep quality and quantity is a critical determinant of perceived stress. Therefore, despite some positive indicators, the overall evidence points towards a perceived stress level that is above the population mean."
49790,"The participant presents with a profile that suggests a moderate perceived stress level, falling slightly below the population mean. While several indicators point towards effective stress management and psychological well-being, certain physiological and behavioral patterns warrant further consideration.

On the positive side, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.07) and is classified as not anxious (STAI Z-score of -1.41). Self-esteem is reported at a level above the population average (SelfEsteem Z-score of 1.1), and current happiness is also reported as above average (Happy Z-score of -0.53). Health satisfaction is also elevated (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 1.22). In terms of behavioral habits, the participant consumes wine or liquor with a frequency of 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.94), which is above the population average, but recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is reported as not at all. They engage in exercise alone and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-scores of 0.32 and 0.53 respectively), which is slightly above average. Daily recreational habits indicate moderate engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.64) and socializing with friends (Z-score of -0.62, indicating less time than average). Notably, reading and video game usage are reported as minimal or absent.

However, certain physiological metrics suggest areas that may be associated with higher stress or disruption. The participant's resting heart rate is notably elevated, with a Z-score of 2.09, placing it significantly above the population average. The Mesor, a measure of the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is also considerably high (Z-score of 2.03). The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a low Interdaily Stability (Z-score of -1.32) and a low Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score of -1.54), indicating a less regular and structured daily rhythm in heart rate. This irregularity is further reflected in the Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor, which shows significant positive deviations during late evening and overnight hours (e.g., 6-7 PM: 12.36, 7-8 PM: 9.52, 9-10 PM: 8.55, 10-11 PM: 6.39, 11 PM-12 AM: 7.22). Sleep statistics indicate a later than average median sleep start time (02:18:20) with a high standard deviation (Z-score of 1.89), suggesting variability in sleep timing. While the median sleep duration is above average (Z-score of 1.1), the overall PSQI score of 7.0 classifies sleep as disturbed, which is not substantially different from the population mean (Z-score of 0.13).

Holistically, the participant's psychological well-being and self-reported health indicators are positive, suggesting effective coping mechanisms and resilience. The lower-than-average perceived stress level relative to the population mean (Population PSS Mean: 21.61; participant's score inferred to be lower than 20.0, the 25th percentile) is supported by these positive self-reports. However, the elevated resting heart rate, high Mesor, and disrupted circadian rhythmicity, particularly the significant overnight heart rate elevations, point to potential physiological dysregulation that might be indicative of underlying stress or an inability to fully downregulate during rest periods. The variability in sleep start times also contributes to a picture of less consistent daily structure. These physiological findings, while not directly correlated with higher PSS scores in this dataset, represent potential vulnerabilities or areas where stress might manifest physiologically, even in the absence of high perceived stress."
78657,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported survey data and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics to evaluate perceived stress. The participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the data, is likely **near the population mean**. While several indicators suggest potential stressors, others point towards coping mechanisms or stable traits that might mitigate perceived stress.

Regarding factors that may indicate relatively higher perceived stress, the participant reports a PSQI score of 7.0, which is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and suggests a subjective experience of poor sleep quality. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is below average for many adults and is associated with a negative Z-score of -0.85. Furthermore, the sleep start time exhibits a considerable standard deviation (123 minutes, Z-score of 0.88), indicating significant variability in sleep onset. The wearable data reveals a notable increase in heart rate deviation from the mesor during late evening and nighttime hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (20.28, Z-score 1.53) and 10-11 PM (12.2, Z-score 0.91), and notably higher values during early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: 3.41, Z-score 1.58; 3-4 AM: -10.85, Z-score 0.87; 4-5 AM: -17.69, Z-score 0.07). While these deviations are not always positive, they indicate heightened physiological activity during periods typically associated with rest. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate is also elevated (0.67, Z-score 0.88), suggesting less stable daily physiological patterns. Additionally, the participant reports listening to music for 3-4 hours daily (Z-score 1.6) and playing video games for 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score 1.71), which, while potentially stress-reducing activities for some, could also represent forms of escapism or avoidance behaviors if excessive. Their ""Trust"" score is also notably high (3.67, Z-score 0.83), which, in some contexts, could be associated with lower perceived stress, but in the context of potential interpersonal stressors, could also be a vulnerability.

Conversely, several factors suggest a relatively lower perceived stress level or protective elements. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 12.0, Z-score -0.14, classified as ""Not depressed"") and low levels of chronic anxiety (STAI-Trait score of 38.0, Z-score -0.33, classified as ""not anxious""). Their self-esteem is within the average range (Score of 39.0, Z-Score 0.11). They engage in regular exercise, both alone and with others, at a frequency of ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), which are positive health behaviors. Their GPA is also robust (3.52 for Fall 2015). Health satisfaction is low (Score of 2.22, Z-score -1.53), which could indicate a current or perceived health concern that might contribute to stress, but the correlation with PSS is low. The participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, and moderate alcohol consumption (Beer and Wine or Liquor 1-2 times a week). The Mesor of their heart rate is relatively low (68.81, Z-score -0.7), suggesting a lower average baseline heart rate. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours of heart rate is also relatively low (-0.61), indicating less adherence to a strict 24-hour cycle. The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is near average. While sleep duration is short, the sleep start time variability might reflect a flexible rather than rigidly structured schedule, which in some contexts, could reduce rigidity-induced stress. The Acrophase of 6:50 PM indicates the peak heart rate occurs in the early evening.

In summary, the participant presents a complex profile. While indicators such as disturbed sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and increased heart rate variability during specific hours suggest potential stressors, their low scores on depression and anxiety, along with high self-esteem and regular exercise, are protective factors. The overall pattern suggests a perceived stress level that is likely near the population mean, balancing these potentially conflicting influences."
48154,"The participant presents with a complex profile that suggests a nuanced interplay of behavioral and physiological factors influencing perceived stress. Notably, self-reported measures indicate lower-than-average levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -1.07) and general anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.12), alongside higher-than-average self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score: 1.66) and happiness (Happy Z-score: 1.64). These psychological indicators generally align with a lower perceived stress level. Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -0.8) and demonstrates a relatively stable sleep duration, with a median of 8 hours and 3 minutes, which is above the population median. Their academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high across semesters.

However, certain behavioral patterns and physiological readings suggest potential areas of elevated stress. The participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week, which is above the population mean (Wine or Liquor Z-score: 0.94). While substance usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs is minimal, the frequency of exercising with others is notably low (Frequency: 'Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score: -0.88), and engagement in sports is moderate (Frequency: '1-2 times a week', Z-score: 0.91). The participant dedicates substantial time to internet usage (2-3 hours daily, Z-score: 0.85), which may indicate a behavioral coping mechanism. Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals pronounced deviations from the mesor during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 am: -9.27, 4-5 am: -13.92, 5-6 am: -13.88), suggesting potential disruptions in the natural circadian rhythm's regulation of heart rate during these periods. This is further supported by a lower than average interdaily stability of heart rate (Interdaily Stability Z-score: -1.23), indicating less regularity in daily physiological patterns, and a lower than average amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm (Amplitude Z-score: -0.71). The acrophase of the circadian rhythm, indicating the peak of heart rate activity, occurs at 5:29 PM, which is within a typical range.

Holistically, the participant exhibits a profile characterized by strong psychological resilience and positive self-perception, coupled with generally good sleep and academic performance. These factors would typically point towards lower perceived stress. However, the elevated alcohol consumption frequency, reduced social exercise, significant internet usage, and particularly the notable deviations in heart rate during sleep and reduced interdaily stability suggest potential underlying physiological and behavioral pressures that may contribute to perceived stress. Despite these potential stressors, the overall pattern of strong self-reported psychological well-being and consistent academic achievement suggests that the participant's perceived stress level is likely near the population mean. Their PSS score is estimated to be near the population mean of 21.62, as indicated by the median PSS score of 22.0 within the study population."
21793,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological and behavioral data, alongside wearable-derived physiological and activity metrics, to interpret the participant's perceived stress level. The participant's overall perceived stress, as inferred from the data, is likely **above the population mean** of 21.6, given the convergent evidence of several indicators.

Several factors suggest a higher perceived stress level. The participant reports a CES-D score of 15.0 and an STAI Trait score of 43.0, indicating a moderate level of depressive symptoms and a classification of ""anxious."" While not alarmingly high, these scores are above average for the study population (CES-D Z-score = 0.18, STAI Z-score = 0.17) and correlate positively with perceived stress (0.28 and 0.31, respectively). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is notably poor with a score of 9.0 and a Z-score of 1.05, suggesting clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is further supported by wearable data indicating a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -1.29). The sleep start time is also highly variable, with a standard deviation of 130 minutes (Z-score = 1.04), and the median sleep start time is remarkably late at 03:36:45. This irregular sleep schedule, coupled with a high frequency of naps (mean of 0.33 per day, Z-score = 3.05), points towards significant disruption in sleep patterns, a common correlate of increased stress.

In terms of daily physiological rhythms, the wearable data reveals notable deviations. The mesor (average heart rate level) is -1.13 standard deviations below the population mean, suggesting a generally lower baseline heart rate. However, there are pronounced hourly deviations from this mesor, particularly during the late night and early morning hours. For instance, the deviations from 2 AM to 5 AM are significantly positive (e.g., 2.07 to 1.95 standard deviations), indicating elevated heart rate during these typically low-activity periods. Conversely, there are periods of significant negative deviation in the morning (e.g., -15.52 deviation from 6-7 AM), suggesting a pronounced drop in heart rate as the day progresses. The intradaily variability is high (Z-score = 0.95), and intradaily stability is low (Z-score = -1.98), indicating a lack of regularity in heart rate patterns throughout the day. This physiological dysregulation, especially the elevated heart rate during periods usually associated with deep sleep, could reflect an activated stress response. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is also late at 6:32 PM, which can be associated with sleep difficulties.

While some indicators suggest a lower perceived stress, they do not outweigh the aforementioned concerns. The participant reports higher-than-average trust (Z-score = -0.46) and happiness (Z-score = -0.53), and higher self-esteem (Z-score = -0.17). These positive psychological states often act as buffers against stress. Daily recreational habits include a considerable amount of time spent listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score = 1.6), which can be a coping mechanism. Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is at a moderate frequency (1-2 times a month), and the participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is moderate, with exercising alone occurring 1-2 times a week. However, the low score correlation for many of these positive indicators with PSS, and the stronger correlations of negative indicators, suggest their buffering effect may be limited.

In conclusion, the participant presents with a constellation of indicators suggestive of elevated perceived stress. This includes self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, significant sleep disturbance and irregularity, and physiological data reflecting dysregulated daily heart rate patterns. While positive psychological attributes such as higher trust and self-esteem are present, they appear to be insufficient to mitigate the impact of the observed stress-related factors, leading to an overall perceived stress level likely above the population mean."
37218,"The participant reports experiencing a moderate level of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 24.0, which is above the population mean. This finding is further supported by a high STAI-Trait score of 49.0, suggesting a proneness to chronic anxiety, also above the population mean. Conversely, the participant exhibits high self-esteem with a score of 29.0, which is significantly below the population mean for this scale, indicating a self-perception of high self-worth. Health satisfaction is moderately low with a score of 3.0, below the population mean, and happiness is also reported as low with a score of 2.0, significantly below the population mean. Trust in others is near the population mean at 3.0. Notably, the participant reports no substance usage and limited engagement in exercise, with the exception of sports participation occurring 1-2 times a month, which is only slightly above the population mean. Daily recreation habits show significant time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours) and socializing with friends (3-4 hours), both of which are notably above the population mean for these activities. Conversely, time spent watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage are also above average, while reading and engaging in sedentary hobbies are not practiced.

The participant's sleep patterns suggest a potential area of concern, with a PSQI score of 10.0 indicating disturbed sleep, placing this metric significantly above the population mean. Wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 1 minute, which is below the population mean, and a relatively low interdaily stability of 0.48, suggesting less regularity in daily activity patterns. The median sleep start time is notably late at 3:56 AM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals periods of elevated deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), which may indicate physiological arousal or disruption during these times. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm is reported as 6:29 PM, aligning with typical evening patterns. The mesor, or average heart rate, is slightly above the population mean. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is below the population mean, suggesting a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate.

Overall, the data suggests that the participant perceives themselves to be under a relatively high level of stress. This is primarily evidenced by elevated scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and chronic anxiety (STAI-Trait), coupled with a low self-reported happiness and moderate health satisfaction. The disturbed sleep patterns, as indicated by the PSQI and a shorter median sleep duration, are also consistent with higher perceived stress. While high self-esteem and a lack of substance use are positive indicators, they do not fully offset the psychological and physiological markers of distress. Considering the combined self-report and physiological data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**."
17932,"This participant's data presents a complex profile with some indicators suggesting a higher perceived stress level while others point towards lower stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 13.0, with a Z-score of 2.9, is a significant indicator of disturbed sleep, classifying the participant's sleep quality as poor. This high PSQI score, coupled with a strong positive correlation between PSQI and PSS (though not explicitly provided in the correlation values for individual metrics, general research indicates such a relationship), suggests a substantial contribution to perceived stress. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a relatively high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.65), which may indicate a degree of circadian rhythm regularity, yet this is counterbalanced by a notably low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.24). This pattern, particularly the low intradaily variability, could suggest a less dynamic cardiovascular response throughout the day, potentially reflecting a blunted physiological stress response or an accustomed state of lower arousal, which may not necessarily correlate with lower perceived stress.

Conversely, several self-report and behavioral metrics suggest a lower perceived stress level. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.14) and is classified as ""not anxious"" based on the STAI-Trait score (Z-score -0.62). Self-esteem is relatively high (SelfEsteem Z-score 0.82), and reported happiness is slightly above average (Happy Z-score -0.53). Trust in others is relatively low (Trust Z-score -1.1), which can sometimes be associated with perceived environmental stressors, but the direct correlation with PSS is minimal. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently high GPAs across multiple semesters, further suggests effective functioning and potentially lower stress impacting cognitive performance. In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in regular exercise, with exercising alone occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), and moderate consumption of alcohol (Beer usage 1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01). Daily recreation habits include significant time spent watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games, which might indicate passive coping mechanisms rather than active stress reduction.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the significantly disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by the PSQI, is a prominent factor likely contributing to a higher perceived stress level. While many psychological and behavioral indicators suggest a relatively low stress state, the sleep data presents a notable exception. The participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean. The high PSQI score, despite otherwise seemingly positive psychological and behavioral indicators, points towards underlying stress that is manifesting in sleep disruption, which in turn is a strong contributor to perceived stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows deviations from the mesor that are more pronounced during the late afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 4-5pm, 5-6pm, 7-8pm, 9-10pm, 10-11pm showing positive deviations), which may align with evening stressors or activities. Conversely, significant negative deviations are observed during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4am, 4-5am, 5-6am, 6-7am), potentially reflecting prolonged periods of low physiological arousal during sleep or early waking. The mesor itself is below the population average (Z-score -1.01), suggesting a lower average heart rate, and the resting heart rate is also notably low (Z-score -1.13), indicating a potentially strong parasympathetic tone or a very fit cardiovascular system, which does not directly clarify perceived stress levels in isolation."
81420,"**Psychological and Behavioral Analysis in Relation to Perceived Stress**

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological and behavioral characteristics that provide insight into their perceived stress levels. Self-report measures suggest a heightened tendency towards anxiety and depressive symptoms, with the STAI (Trait) score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86) classifying the individual as generally anxious, and the CES-D score of 25.0 (Z-score 1.22) indicating a significant burden of depressive symptoms. These scores are positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with greater perceived stress. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively lower, indicated by a SelfEsteem score of 31.0 (Z-score -1.01), which, though negatively correlated with perceived stress, may not fully mitigate the impact of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Additionally, reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), with a weak negative correlation to perceived stress, suggesting it may offer a minor buffer. Health satisfaction is notably lower than the population mean (Z-score -1.11), and while not strongly correlated with perceived stress, it may reflect an underlying concern or negative appraisal of well-being.

Behavioral patterns reveal moderate engagement in social and physical activities, potentially contributing to reduced perceived stress. The participant exercises alone frequently (Frequency: 'Three times a week or more', Z-score 1.07) and with others and participates in sports with moderate frequency, though these activities show weak correlations with perceived stress. Daily recreational habits indicate a notable emphasis on reading (Time: '16-30 minutes', Z-score 1.3), which is negatively correlated with perceived stress, and moderate engagement in socialising with friends (Time: '1-2 hours', Z-score 0.16). However, substance usage, specifically beer consumption (Usage: '1-2 times a week', Z-score 1.01), is more frequent than the population mean, and while exhibiting a weak negative correlation, it could be interpreted as a coping mechanism. Internet usage is lower than average (Z-score -1.16), while video game usage is higher than average (Z-score 0.96).

Physiological and circadian rhythm data indicate some potential disruptions that may be associated with perceived stress. The participant's interdaily stability is low (Value: 0.29, Z-score -0.99), suggesting a less structured daily routine, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, intradaily variability is high (Value: 0.31, Z-score -1.66), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, a factor positively correlated with perceived stress. The MESOR (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated relative to the population mean (Value: 78.34, Z-score 0.6), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is below average (Value: 8.49, Z-score -0.74), suggesting a flatter daily heart rate fluctuation, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals elevated deviations during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM: Z-score 1.23, 4-5 AM: Z-score 0.79, 5-6 AM: Z-score 0.64), particularly when compared to resting heart rate. This pattern of physiological arousal during typical sleep periods is positively correlated with perceived stress. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes, which is close to the population mean (Z-score 0.02), however, the median sleep start time is notably late (02:40:30), with a standard deviation suggesting variability in sleep timing. The PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-Score 0.59) indicates disturbed sleep, aligning with the classification of 'Disturbed Sleep', and has a positive correlation with perceived stress, highlighting the potential impact of sleep quality on stress perception.

Holistically, the participant appears to be experiencing a perceived stress level that is **above the population mean**. This inference is primarily driven by the elevated scores in anxiety and depressive symptoms, the lower self-esteem, and the disturbed sleep quality, all of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, the physiological data indicating heightened arousal during sleep hours and the lower interdaily stability contribute to this assessment. While some behavioral factors like reading and socialising may offer a buffer, they do not appear to fully counteract the significant impact of psychological and physiological indicators of stress."
67709,"The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data indicate a complex interplay of factors potentially influencing perceived stress. Notably, the participant reports a high burden of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 29.0, which falls into the ""Depressed"" classification and is significantly above the population mean for this metric. This is further supported by a relatively high score on the STAI Trait Anxiety scale (46.0), classified as ""anxious,"" suggesting a predisposition towards higher baseline anxiety. In contrast, self-esteem appears to be near the population average, with a Z-score of -0.73 indicating it is below the mean but not substantially so, and a negative correlation with PSS suggests higher self-esteem may be associated with lower stress. Similarly, general happiness is reported as slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55), with a weak negative correlation to PSS, suggesting that while subjective happiness is somewhat elevated, it may not fully buffer against perceived stress. The participant also reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, which exceeds the threshold for common clinical significance, and this metric shows a slightly negative correlation with PSS, implying poorer sleep quality might be associated with higher perceived stress.

The participant's behavioral habits present a mixed profile. Substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, all of which have notably low Z-scores, suggesting significantly less usage compared to the study population and a weak association with PSS. In terms of exercise, the participant engages in exercising with others ""Three times a week or more,"" which is a high frequency (Z-score of 1.23) and shows a minimal negative correlation with PSS. However, exercising alone occurs less frequently (""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score of 0.32), and participation in sports is infrequent (""Not at all,"" Z-score of -1.09), with these activities showing weak correlations with PSS. Daily recreation habits are dominated by higher internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score of 1.52) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score of 1.13), both of which have positive correlations with PSS, suggesting these activities might be associated with higher stress levels. Conversely, activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, and reading are reported as infrequent or not engaged in at all, with reading having a notable negative correlation with PSS. Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours, which is near the population average.

Physiological data derived from the wearable device present further insights. The participant's sleep patterns are characterized by a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 16 minutes, Z-score of 1.34) but a high variability in sleep duration (Z-score of 1.65), with a weak positive correlation to PSS. The median sleep start time is quite late (03:45:29), with moderate variability (Z-score of 0.33), and both sleep duration and start time show weak associations with PSS. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate a relatively low interdaily stability (Value of 0.38, Z-score of -0.24) and high intradaily variability (Value of 0.46, Z-score of -0.6), suggesting a less structured daily rhythm, with intradaily variability showing a positive correlation with PSS. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is below the population mean (Z-score of -0.83), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is above average (Z-score of 0.27), with both showing weak correlations with PSS. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal notable patterns of physiological arousal. Specifically, there are significant deviations during the evening hours, with a peak deviation of +29.45 (Z-score of 2.76) between 5-6 PM and a substantial deviation of +19.67 (Z-score of 1.24) between 6-7 PM. These elevated deviations in the late afternoon and early evening, particularly the statistically significant peak, suggest heightened physiological arousal during this period, and these specific evening deviations show weak negative correlations with PSS. Conversely, during the overnight and early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM), heart rate deviations are notably negative and of considerable magnitude, suggesting periods of low physiological activity relative to the mesor. The resting heart rate is also below the population average (Z-score of -0.56), with a weak positive correlation to PSS.

Considering the comprehensive dataset, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. This inference is primarily driven by the high scores on measures of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with evidence of disturbed sleep quality. While the participant reports above-average happiness and near-average self-esteem, these factors do not fully mitigate the indicators of psychological distress. The pattern of late-night internet usage and listening to music, alongside the reduced engagement in sports and solitary exercise, may contribute to a less regulated lifestyle, potentially exacerbating stress. The physiological data, particularly the pronounced elevation in heart rate deviation during late afternoon and early evening, alongside high variability in sleep duration, further suggests physiological dysregulation that could be linked to higher perceived stress."
36552,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing their perceived stress. On one hand, several indicators point towards a relatively lower level of perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 10.0, z-score of -0.34), and a moderate to high level of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 40.0, z-score of 0.26), aligning with a generally positive self-regard. Furthermore, the participant engages in frequent solitary exercise (frequency of ""Three times a week or more,"" z-score of 1.07), a behavior often associated with stress reduction. Their substance usage patterns are also infrequent, with beer and wine/liquor consumed ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" and recreational or non-prescribed drugs used ""Not at all."" This suggests a healthy lifestyle foundation that may buffer against stress.

Conversely, certain aspects of the participant's data suggest potential contributors to higher perceived stress. The participant reports generally disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (z-score of 0.13), a value that commonly signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is further supported by their median sleep duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes, which is notably shorter than typical recommendations and has a z-score of -1.0, indicating it is below the population mean. The participant also exhibits a higher than average resting heart rate (Value of 64.3, z-score of 0.73), which can be a physiological indicator of arousal or stress. Their intradaily variability in heart rate is also elevated (Value of 0.72, z-score of 1.23), suggesting more fluctuation throughout the day. Notably, the average deviation from the mesor for heart rate during the 3-4 PM and 4-5 PM hours are significantly elevated (z-scores of 0.64 and 0.67 respectively), and the 3-4 PM deviation shows a very large positive value (19.92 with a z-score of 1.99), potentially indicating periods of higher physiological arousal during the afternoon. Additionally, the participant reports being more anxious (STAI score of 44.0, z-score of 0.27), which directly correlates with proneness to anxiety.

Considering the collective evidence, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the provided data, appears to be *near the population mean* for the study sample. While the participant demonstrates several protective factors such as high self-esteem and healthy substance use habits, these are counterbalanced by indicators of chronic sleep disturbance, higher resting heart rate, and elevated afternoon physiological arousal, alongside a tendency towards anxiety. The strong positive correlation between anxiety proneness and perceived stress (0.31) further suggests that this trait likely contributes to their overall stress experience. The sleep metrics, particularly the shorter sleep duration and associated negative z-scores, are significant factors that often contribute to increased stress perception."
63138,"The participant presents with a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score that, while not explicitly provided, can be inferred through a multimodal analysis of their psychological and physiological data in relation to the study population.

**Factors Suggesting Relatively Higher Perceived Stress:**

Several indicators within the dataset suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. The participant exhibits a positive correlation between the STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) trait anxiety score and PSS, with their score of 40 falling into the ""anxious"" classification. This suggests a baseline tendency towards experiencing anxiety, which often co-occurs with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, wearable data reveals a high Intradaily Variability (Z-Score: 1.16), indicating significant fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. This irregularity in physiological response can be indicative of stress-induced arousal or disrupted physiological regulation. The participant also reports a relatively high frequency of beer and wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week for both, with Z-Scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), which can be a coping mechanism for stress. Lastly, a lower frequency of exercising alone (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-Score: -1.18) and a generally low engagement in sedentary recreational activities like reading (reported as ""Do not do,"" Z-Score: -0.67) might reflect less emphasis on stress-reducing personal activities.

**Factors Suggesting Relatively Lower Perceived Stress:**

Conversely, several elements point towards a lower perceived stress experience. The participant reports a high GPA across multiple semesters (ranging from 3.81 to 3.94), suggesting academic success and potentially effective stress management in that domain. Their Self-Esteem score of 38.0 is near the maximum possible score (40), indicating a strong sense of self-worth, which is generally associated with lower stress levels. Similarly, their reported happiness level is above average (Z-Score: 0.55), and health satisfaction is also higher than the mean (Z-Score: 0.38). The CES-D score of 8.0 falls into the ""Not depressed"" classification, with a negative Z-score (-0.55), indicating low levels of depressive symptoms. Sleep statistics, while not indicating perfectly regular sleep start times (standard deviation of 58 minutes), do show a good median sleep duration of 8 hours and 21 minutes (Z-Score: 1.45), which is a substantial amount of sleep and generally conducive to lower stress. The MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) for heart rate is above the population mean (Z-Score: 0.44), and the amplitude is also relatively high (Z-Score: 0.88), suggesting a robust circadian rhythm, which is often linked to better stress resilience.

**Holistic Conclusion:**

Considering the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While there are indicators of potential stress, such as higher anxiety proneness, substance usage, and physiological variability, these are balanced by strong protective factors including high academic achievement, robust self-esteem, positive affect, and adequate sleep duration. The positive correlations of STAI with PSS and the negative correlations of Self-Esteem, Happiness, and Health Satisfaction with PSS align with these observations. The mesor and amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm being above the population mean also suggest a degree of physiological resilience. Therefore, the evidence suggests a complex interplay of factors, resulting in a perceived stress level that is not markedly elevated above the study population."
16654,"The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be near the population mean. While the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is not directly provided, several indicators suggest an average level of stress within the study population. Specifically, the participant's scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.38) and general anxiety (STAI Z-score of -0.72) are below average, indicating a lower tendency towards these negative affective states. Furthermore, their self-esteem score (Z-Score of 0.11) and reported happiness (Z-Score of -0.53) are also relatively close to the population mean, with self-esteem being slightly above average and happiness slightly below. These psychological indicators, combined with a PSQI score (Z-Score of -0.33) suggesting only mild sleep disturbance, collectively point towards a participant experiencing a moderate level of perceived stress.

Several behavioral and physiological metrics contribute to this assessment. The participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (Beer Z-Score of 1.01, Wine or Liquor Z-Score of 0.94) and abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Their exercise habits include exercising with others more than three times a week (Z-Score of 1.23), which correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting a potential buffer against higher stress. However, the relatively high frequency of watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score of 0.01) and moderate internet usage (Z-Score of -0.49) suggest a lifestyle that may not be maximally conducive to stress reduction. From a physiological standpoint, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a consistent diurnal pattern, with the most significant positive deviations from the mesor occurring in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 1-2 PM Z-Score of 1.83, 5-6 PM Z-Score of 0.90). Negative deviations are more pronounced in the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-Score of -0.93, 5-6 AM Z-Score of -0.91), which is generally consistent with typical physiological responses during sleep and waking. The mesor itself (Z-Score of 0.57) is slightly elevated, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-Score of 1.44) is notably higher than average, suggesting a more pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm (Z-Score of 1.08) is also above average, indicating good regularity.

In terms of sleep, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes (Z-Score of 0.73), which is longer than average, suggesting adequate sleep quantity. The sleep duration standard deviation (Z-Score of -1.04) and sleep start time standard deviation (Z-Score of -1.17) are both below average, indicating a consistent and regular sleep schedule, which is generally indicative of lower stress. However, the median sleep start time of 1:37 AM is relatively late, which, when coupled with a high mesor and amplitude in heart rate, might suggest some degree of circadian misalignment or increased arousal during evening hours. The correlation coefficients between these metrics and PSS scores, though generally weak, do not strongly point towards either a significantly elevated or reduced stress level based on these specific behavioral and physiological parameters. Therefore, considering the overall constellation of self-reported, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant's perceived stress level is estimated to be near the population mean of 21.62."
29134,"The participant's self-reported data suggests a relatively low level of perceived stress, particularly in areas of emotional well-being and academic performance. The absence of significant depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -0.14) and anxiety proneness (STAI-Trait Z-score of -0.33) indicates a stable emotional baseline. Similarly, a healthy level of self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score of 0.11) and overall happiness (Happy Z-score of 0.55) further support this interpretation. While academic performance shows a slight decline across semesters, the GPAs remain within a reasonable range, suggesting that academic demands may not be a primary source of significant stress. Notably, the participant reports low engagement with recreational and non-prescribed drugs, further contributing to a profile of controlled and stable behaviors.

Conversely, several indicators point towards potential stressors related to sleep quality and health satisfaction. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0, with a Z-score of 1.98, signifies a substantial level of disturbed sleep, significantly above the population mean for this metric. This subjective experience of poor sleep quality is further corroborated by the wearable data, which indicates considerable variability in sleep duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of 1.33) and a highly inconsistent sleep start time (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of 2.2), with a median start time of 1:13 AM. These findings suggest a significant challenge in establishing a regular sleep schedule, which is a known contributor to elevated stress. Furthermore, the participant's health satisfaction score is slightly above average (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 0.55), which, in the context of disturbed sleep, could suggest an awareness of health-related concerns that may contribute to stress.

Regarding physiological and behavioral patterns, the participant exhibits a generally regular circadian rhythm, as indicated by a Mesor (mean heart rate) Z-score of -0.56, which is below the population mean, suggesting a potentially lower baseline heart rate. The amplitude Z-score of -0.51 also suggests a moderate daily variation in heart rate. While the interdaily stability of heart rate is at the population mean (Z-score of 0.0), the intradaily variability is slightly below the population mean (Z-score of -0.18), suggesting a relatively predictable pattern of heart rate fluctuations throughout the day. The acrophase at 5:06 PM aligns with a typical diurnal pattern. However, the significant deviation in sleep patterns, particularly the late and highly variable sleep start times, suggests that these physiological rhythms may be disrupted by behavioral choices. The participant's high engagement in exercising with others and participating in sports (Z-scores of 1.23 and 1.58 respectively), and a notable frequency of reading (Z-score of 1.3), could be interpreted as positive coping mechanisms or activities that contribute to well-being. However, the high consumption of beer and wine (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively) and the relatively high amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score of 0.01) and internet usage (Z-score of 0.18) may indicate a reliance on sedentary or potentially escapist behaviors, which could either mitigate or exacerbate stress depending on their context and overall impact on daily functioning.

Holistically, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean. While several self-report measures of psychological well-being and stable personality traits indicate a low stress profile, the significant disturbances in sleep quality and the corresponding physiological markers of irregular sleep patterns suggest a counterbalancing influence that likely elevates their overall perceived stress. The pronounced sleep issues, indicated by high PSQI scores and highly variable sleep start times, are likely the most significant contributors to a moderate level of perceived stress, preventing it from falling significantly below the population average."
24029,"The participant exhibits several indicators suggesting a relatively high level of perceived stress, particularly when viewed in conjunction with their academic context. Self-report measures reveal elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 21.0, Z-score of 0.8) and chronic anxiety (STAI score of 50.0, Z-score of 0.86). These scores are positioned above the population mean for CES-D (Mean: 21.59, SD: 3.65) with the Z-score indicating a score slightly below the 75th percentile for the population. However, the positive correlations between both CES-D (0.28) and STAI (0.31) with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) suggest that these elevated scores are likely contributing to a higher perception of stress. Further, the participant reports low self-esteem (SelfEsteem score of 29.0, Z-score of -1.29), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.15), implying that lower self-esteem may be associated with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns and wearable-derived metrics also provide context for the participant's stress levels. The participant engages in high levels of certain leisure activities, including watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28), playing video games (1-2 hours, Z-score 2.47), and listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06). These patterns, particularly the substantial time spent on video games and listening to music, are associated with a mild negative correlation with PSS (-0.15 and 0.06 respectively), suggesting that while these may be coping mechanisms, they do not significantly reduce perceived stress and in the case of video games, might be linked to higher stress. Furthermore, the participant demonstrates significantly higher engagement in exercise, both alone (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) and with others (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23), and sports (Frequency: Three times a week or more, Z-score 1.58). While exercise is generally beneficial, its high frequency, particularly sports with others (-0.14 correlation with PSS), does not appear to significantly attenuate perceived stress. Sleep data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score -0.52), which is below the average and negatively correlates with PSS (-0.04), suggesting that shorter sleep duration may be associated with increased perceived stress. The participant also exhibits high intradaily variability in heart rate (Value: 0.7, Z-score 1.09), which correlates positively with PSS (0.15), indicating a less stable physiological rhythm that may be indicative of heightened stress responses. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows marked deviations from the mesor, with the most pronounced negative deviations occurring in the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 am: -22.45, 1-2 am: -23.18, 4-5 am: -25.86), potentially reflecting difficulties in winding down or experiencing disrupted sleep. Conversely, the late morning and afternoon hours show positive deviations (e.g., 6-7 am: 17.63, 7-8 am: 12.19, 4-5 pm: 18.09), which could reflect periods of increased physiological arousal.

Considering the data holistically, the participant's elevated scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with lower self-esteem and suboptimal sleep duration, strongly suggest a relatively high perceived stress level. The observed patterns of high engagement in specific leisure activities and a less stable circadian rhythm, as indicated by intradaily variability in heart rate, further support this conclusion. These factors collectively point towards a state of elevated psychological distress and physiological dysregulation.

Based on the provided population data, the participant's perceived stress level is likely **above the population mean**. The population mean PSS is 21.59, with a median of 22.0. While the exact PSS score for this participant is not provided, the confluence of negative psychological indicators (elevated CES-D and STAI, low self-esteem), suboptimal sleep, and physiological markers of potential stress (high heart rate variability) suggests an individual experiencing a higher level of perceived stress than the average participant in the study."
35361,"The participant exhibits several behavioral and physiological patterns that suggest a perceived stress level potentially near the population mean. The self-reported Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, although not directly provided, can be inferred from accompanying metrics. The participant's PSQI score of 4.0, falling below the commonly cited threshold of 5 for clinically significant sleep disturbance and showing a Z-score of -1.26 relative to the study population, indicates good subjective sleep quality, which is typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports not engaging in the usage of alcohol, wine, liquor, or recreational drugs, and their self-reported happiness score (Z-score: 0.55) is above the population mean, suggesting a positive psychological outlook. Their engagement in exercise, with frequent solitary exercise (Z-score: 1.07) and moderate exercise with others (Z-score: 0.53), along with a significant amount of reading time (Z-score: 1.3), are generally indicative of healthy coping mechanisms and potentially lower stress. The absence of substance usage also contributes to an overall picture of potentially lower stress.

However, certain wearable-derived metrics and self-reported lifestyle habits introduce nuance to this interpretation. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, while having a Z-score of -0.31 (indicating it is slightly shorter than the average), is not drastically dissimilar to the population mean. The interdaily stability of the participant's heart rate is notably high (Z-score: 1.49), suggesting a highly regular daily rhythm, which can be protective against stress. Conversely, the intradaily variability is relatively low (Z-score: -1.24), which might indicate less physiological reactivity to daily fluctuations. The participant's mesor (average heart rate over the 24-hour period) is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.84), and their resting heart rate is also below the mean (Z-score: -0.99), suggesting a generally calm physiological baseline. The acrophase, indicating the peak time of the circadian rhythm, is observed in the late afternoon (4:28 PM).

The average deviation from the mesor for heart rate reveals a more complex picture of daily physiological activity. Notably, there are significant deviations during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-4 AM (Z-score: -1.3) and 4-5 AM (Z-score: -1.71), where heart rate is considerably lower than the daily average. This deep dip in heart rate during these pre-dawn hours is consistent with deep sleep stages. In contrast, the afternoon and early evening hours show elevated deviations from the mesor, with notable peaks between 1-2 PM (Z-score: 1.48) and 4-5 PM (Z-score: 1.07), suggesting periods of higher physiological arousal during these times. The correlation analysis indicates a modest positive correlation between higher deviation from mesor during the 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, and 6-7 AM hours and the PSS score, suggesting that greater reduction in heart rate during these early morning hours may be associated with increased perceived stress. Conversely, deviations during the late afternoon and evening hours show modest negative correlations with the PSS score, implying that increased heart rate during these times might be associated with lower perceived stress, although these correlations are generally weak.

Overall, considering the combination of positive self-reported psychological indicators and good sleep quality, alongside a generally stable circadian rhythm and a lower resting heart rate, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be around the population mean. While there are periods of notable physiological activity during the afternoon, and certain early morning heart rate patterns show a weak positive association with stress, these do not strongly outweigh the protective factors identified. The Z-scores for many metrics fall within a moderate range, and the correlations with PSS, while providing directional clues, are not overwhelmingly strong, suggesting a balanced overall stress experience relative to the study population. Therefore, the participant's perceived stress level is likely near the population mean, with elements suggesting both potential resilience and minor areas of physiological variation that warrant consideration."
49086,"The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score of -1.28) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score of -1.02), suggesting a generally stable emotional state. Self-esteem is reported at a level above the population mean (SelfEsteem Z-score of 1.1). Health satisfaction is also reported above the population mean (Health Satisfaction Z-score of -0.7). Trust in others is at a moderate level (Trust Z-score of 0.83). Happiness is reported slightly below the population mean (Happy Z-score of -0.53). These self-reported measures collectively indicate a generally positive psychological disposition, with the exception of a slightly lower reported happiness.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor being consumed 1-2 times a week, which is above the population mean for this category (Wine or Liquor Z-score of 0.94). Beer consumption is less frequent, occurring 1-2 times a month (Beer Z-score of 0.3). Notably, the participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is notably low, with no reported instances of exercising alone, exercising with others, or participating in sports, as indicated by significantly low Z-scores for these activities (Exercised Alone Z-score of -1.93, Exercised with Others Z-score of -1.58, Sports Z-score of -1.09). Daily recreational habits include moderate time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.64) and listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.67), and socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.95). Internet usage is also within a moderate range (1-2 hours, Z-score of 0.18), while time spent reading is limited (15 minutes or less, Z-score of 0.32). Sedentary hobby time is relatively high (31 minutes an hour, Z-score of 0.82). This profile suggests a lifestyle with limited physical exertion and moderate social engagement, alongside significant time spent in sedentary leisure activities.

Wearable data reveal a regular sleep pattern with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Median Sleep Duration Z-score of 0.15). The standard deviation for sleep duration is also within typical ranges (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score of 0.13). However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:19:30, with a standard deviation suggesting some variability in sleep onset (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score of -0.11). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reasonable stability and regularity in heart rate patterns, with an Interdaily Stability Z-score of -0.16 and an Intradaily Variability Z-score of -0.18, suggesting neither exceptionally high nor low regularity. The Mesor (mean heart rate) of 69.47 is below the population mean (Mesor Z-score of -0.61), indicating a lower baseline heart rate. The Amplitude of 9.01 is also below the population mean (Amplitude Z-score of -0.57), suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. The Acrophase, or peak time of the circadian rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:43 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals significant deviations during specific periods. Most notably, there are marked positive deviations in heart rate from the Mesor during late night to early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM with a Z-score of 1.66, 1-2 AM with a Z-score of 1.18), suggesting increased physiological arousal during these times. Conversely, during the morning and early afternoon, heart rate deviations from the Mesor are largely negative (e.g., 6-7 AM with a Z-score of -0.14, 7-8 AM with a Z-score of -0.54, 8-9 AM with a Z-score of -1.27, 9-10 AM with a Z-score of -1.59), indicating a period of lower physiological activity relative to the mean.

Considering the provided metrics and their correlations with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, several factors suggest a potentially elevated PSS. The late sleep start time and its associated variability, despite adequate total sleep duration, may contribute to stress. Furthermore, the significant positive deviations in heart rate from the Mesor during late night and early morning hours, which often correlate with periods of perceived stress or arousal, are noteworthy. While many psychological and behavioral factors appear favorable, indicating lower potential stress, the data on physical activity and some aspects of sleep timing warrant consideration. The participant's overall perceived stress level, when inferred from the holistic analysis of these metrics, appears to be near the population mean. The relatively balanced indicators of psychological well-being, combined with specific physiological patterns suggesting late-night arousal and minimal physical activity, suggest a moderate level of perceived stress that aligns with the population average."
95490,"**Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Interpretation: Multimodal Analysis**

The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be above the population mean. This is indicated by several factors within the self-reported survey data. Specifically, the participant reports a high level of trait anxiety, as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), with a score of 47.0 and a Z-score of 0.56, placing them in the ""anxious"" classification. Furthermore, while the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 14.0 falls within the ""not depressed"" range, its positive correlation (0.28) with PSS warrants attention. The participant's self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), is relatively lower, with a score of 34.0 and a Z-score of -0.59, indicating less self-worth. Health satisfaction is also moderately below average, with a score of 3.89 and a Z-score of -0.28. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), is reported as disturbed, with a score of 6.0 and a Z-score of -0.33, suggesting a common threshold for sleep disturbance. These self-reported measures collectively point towards a psychological state associated with elevated perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns and wearable-derived physiological data offer further insights into the participant's stress experience. The participant engages in moderate substance usage, with beer and wine/liquor consumed ""1-2 times a week,"" which are above population norms for these categories (Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively). In terms of physical activity, the participant exercises alone ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.07), which is a positive behavioral indicator. However, engagement in sports and exercising with others is less frequent. Daily recreation habits show a significant amount of time spent ""socializing with friends"" (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95) and ""listening to music"" (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.67), which can be stress-buffering activities. Conversely, time spent reading is notably absent (""Do not do,"" Z-score -0.67).

Physiological data from the wearable device reveal characteristics of the participant's circadian rhythm and heart rate variability that may be associated with stress. The interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (0.23, Z-score -1.48), suggesting a less structured daily routine and potentially inconsistent activity patterns. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also lower than the population average (-1.12), indicating a reduced tendency for daily activity to resemble the previous day's pattern. While the mesor (average heart rate level) is slightly above the population mean (77.1, Z-score 0.43), the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is lower than average (-0.79), suggesting a reduced daily variation in heart rate. Hourly heart rate data indicates periods of elevated physiological arousal, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM with a deviation of +16.49 and 5-6 PM with +16.61). Conversely, there are periods of lower heart rate deviation during the night and early morning. Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes, which is slightly below optimal, with a notable sleep start time around 1:11 AM. The standard deviation for both sleep duration and sleep start time are within typical ranges, suggesting some variability but not extreme irregularity.

In summation, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be above the population mean. This is supported by elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, and disturbed subjective sleep quality. While some positive behavioral habits such as regular exercise alone and social engagement are present, the overall pattern of self-reported psychological indicators, combined with less stable daily physiological rhythms and periods of increased cardiovascular arousal, suggests a heightened experience of stress during the academic semester."
90079,"The participant's perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), appears to be elevated. This is supported by several indicators. Firstly, the participant reports a moderate level of subjective sleep disturbance, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, which falls above the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and is associated with a positive correlation (0.13) with PSS. Furthermore, the wearable data reveals a significantly shorter median sleep duration of 5 hours and 54 minutes, which has a substantial negative Z-score of -1.59, indicating it is considerably lower than the study population's average. Shorter sleep duration is strongly correlated ( -0.04) with higher PSS, suggesting a potential link between insufficient sleep and perceived stress. The intradaily variability of heart rate is notably high (Z-score of 1.44), suggesting less stable physiological regulation throughout the day, which can be indicative of stress. This metric also shows a positive correlation (0.16) with PSS. Conversely, interdaily stability of heart rate, a measure of circadian rhythm regularity, is low (Z-score of -1.65), implying a disrupted daily pattern, which is negatively correlated (-0.11) with PSS. The participant's average heart rate deviation from the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (specifically 2-3 AM, 3-4 AM, 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM, 6-7 AM) shows marked negative deviations (e.g., -12.71 at 3-4 AM), suggesting the body is not entering a resting state as expected during typical sleep hours, further reinforcing the interpretation of sleep disturbance and potential stress.

In contrast, certain self-reported psychological traits suggest a lower propensity for stress-related difficulties. The participant's score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) indicates they are ""not anxious"" with a Z-score of -0.33, and this trait anxiety is only weakly correlated with PSS (0.31). Similarly, their self-esteem score is relatively high (Z-score of -0.59), with a negative correlation (-0.15) to PSS, suggesting that higher self-esteem might be associated with lower perceived stress. The participant also reports high levels of trust in others (Z-score of -1.42), although this has a near-zero correlation with PSS (-0.04). Their self-reported happiness is also above average (Z-score of -0.53), with a weak negative correlation (-0.19) with PSS. Furthermore, the participant engages in moderate levels of exercise, with frequency of exercising alone and with others both falling within the ""1-2 times a week"" category. They also report no substance usage and limited engagement in sedentary recreational activities such as watching TV/videos or playing video games. These behavioral patterns, generally indicative of a healthier lifestyle, might be expected to buffer against stress.

Considering the available data, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean**. While certain self-reported psychological traits and lifestyle habits suggest resilience, the objective measures of sleep quality and physiological rhythm regularity, along with the subjective report of sleep disturbance, strongly indicate an elevated stress experience. The median sleep duration being significantly below average and the high intradaily heart rate variability are particularly compelling indicators of potential physiological dysregulation linked to stress. These objective physiological markers and sleep data appear to carry more weight in inferring perceived stress than the more trait-based self-report measures, leading to the conclusion that the participant is experiencing a higher level of perceived stress than the average in the study sample."
22842,"The participant exhibits a profile that suggests a moderate to elevated level of perceived stress, likely falling around or above the population mean for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This inference is supported by several indicators across self-report surveys and wearable-derived metrics. Notably, the participant reports significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 20.0, Z-score 0.7) and a classification of ""Depressed,"" along with higher-than-average proneness to chronic anxiety (STAI score of 46.0, Z-score 0.46, classified as ""anxious""). These psychological indicators are often associated with increased perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), which is considerably above the commonly cited threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and falls within the upper quartile of the population. This subjective poor sleep quality, alongside a higher-than-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score 0.83), suggests potential issues with sleep regulation or restoration. The standard deviation for sleep duration (133 minutes, Z-score 0.73) and the sleep start time (164 minutes, Z-score 1.79) are notably elevated, indicating significant day-to-day variability in sleep patterns, which can be a marker of stress and disrupted circadian regulation.

Conversely, some metrics suggest factors that might indicate a relatively lower perceived stress level or resilience. The participant's self-esteem is within the average range (SelfEsteem score of 36.0, Z-score -0.31), and their reported happiness is slightly below average (Happy score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53), which does not strongly suggest high stress. Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drugs, is reported as infrequent (""Less than 1-2 times a month"" or ""Not at all""), with associated Z-scores generally below the mean, indicating low risk in this domain. The participant engages in solo exercise frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07), which is a positive health behavior. However, exercise with others and participation in sports are less frequent. Daily recreation habits show a higher-than-average time spent on video games (Z-score 1.71), while reading and listening to music are less frequent. The wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal a lower-than-average interdaily stability (Value 0.3, Z-score -0.9) and intradaily variability (Value 0.46, Z-score -0.6), suggesting a less robust diurnal rhythm in heart rate, which can be indicative of stress and reduced adaptability. The mesor (mean heart rate level) is below average (Value 69.34, Z-score -0.63), and the amplitude of heart rate variation is also lower than average (Value 8.7, Z-score -0.67), suggesting a potentially blunted physiological response to daily challenges.

In summary, the participant's profile is characterized by significant indicators of elevated perceived stress, including substantial depressive symptoms, high chronic anxiety, and markedly disturbed and variable sleep patterns, all of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. While some healthy behaviors like frequent solo exercise are present, and substance use is low, the overall pattern, particularly the psychological and sleep data, points towards a higher stress burden. The data suggests the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely above the population mean for the study sample. The population mean for PSS is 21.61, with a standard deviation of 3.68. The participant's elevated scores in CES-D, STAI, and PSQI, along with sleep variability, strongly suggest their PSS score would fall within the upper range of this distribution, possibly above the 75th percentile."
14279,"The participant's self-reported data suggest a profile characterized by relatively lower levels of distress and negative affect, alongside indicators of good social functioning and academic achievement. Specifically, the participant reports not being depressed (CES-D score of 5.0, z-score -0.86) and not being chronically anxious (STAI score of 38.0, z-score -0.33). Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 40.0, z-score 0.26, the maximum possible score), and trust in others is notably low (Trust score of 2.33, z-score -1.74). Happiness is reported at a level below the population mean (z-score -0.53). Academic performance is strong, with GPAs consistently above 3.75. Health satisfaction is also reported as slightly below the population mean (z-score -0.37). Regarding lifestyle, the participant consumes wine or liquor weekly (z-score 0.94) but drinks beer less than 1-2 times a month (z-score -0.41). Recreational drug use is reported as not at all. Exercise habits are mixed, with sports participation and exercising with others occurring 1-2 times a week (z-scores 0.91 and 0.53, respectively), while exercising alone is less frequent (1-2 times a month, z-score -0.43). Daily recreational activities are notably low in sedentary behaviors such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage, with the participant spending minimal time on these (z-scores ranging from -0.62 to 0.2). Notably, the participant reports not listening to music or reading, and not engaging in sedentary hobbies (z-scores -1.19, -0.67, and -0.96, respectively). Socializing with friends occurs for 1-2 hours daily (z-score 0.16). Overall, these self-report measures, particularly the low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, and high self-esteem, do not directly suggest elevated perceived stress.

Physiological and behavioral metrics from the wearable device indicate a generally stable and regular circadian rhythm with some deviation from the population norm in terms of amplitude and variability. The interdaily stability of heart rate is above the population mean (z-score 0.58), suggesting consistency in daily patterns. However, intradaily variability is also above the population mean (z-score 0.53), indicating more pronounced fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is also elevated (z-score 0.81), reinforcing the regularity of daily cycles. The mesor, representing the average heart rate, is slightly above the population mean (z-score 0.41), while the amplitude, reflecting the extent of daily variation, is significantly higher than the population mean (z-score 1.11), suggesting more pronounced swings in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, the time of peak heart rate, occurs at 4:05 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly above the population mean (z-score 0.1). Sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes, which is longer than the population average (z-score 1.24), suggesting adequate sleep. Sleep duration variability is near the population mean (z-score -0.19). The median sleep start time is around midnight (00:17:58), with moderate variability (z-score -0.37).

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal relative to the participant's mesor. During the early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate consistently deviates below the mesor, with the most pronounced deviations occurring between 3 AM and 5 AM (e.g., -20.74 to -22.0). As the day progresses, heart rate begins to rise above the mesor, particularly in the late morning and afternoon. Notable peaks in deviation above the mesor occur between 10 AM and 12 PM (up to 16.99), 12 PM and 1 PM (21.9), 3 PM and 4 PM (17.71), and 6 PM and 7 PM (23.31). These periods of elevated heart rate deviation during the day, especially in the afternoon and early evening, may reflect periods of increased physiological engagement or stress response. Conversely, the late evening and nighttime hours show a return to below-mesor deviations.

Considering all available data, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be near the population mean for PSS. While low scores on depression and anxiety, coupled with high self-esteem, suggest good psychological resilience, the elevated amplitude and intradaily variability of heart rate, along with significant deviations above the mesor during active waking hours, could indicate physiological responses associated with stress. The relatively low trust in others might also contribute to heightened vigilance, though it doesn't directly correlate with PSS. The participant's PSQI score of 7.0 suggests disturbed sleep, which, while not critically high, can be associated with stress. The moderate to high engagement in sports and exercising with others could be stress-buffering, yet the overall physiological arousal patterns, particularly during the day, warrant consideration in conjunction with the PSS score. Without a direct PSS score, inferring it as ""near the mean"" is a balanced interpretation given the mixed signals."
28327,"The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators that collectively suggest a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. Self-report measures reveal elevated scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Z-score = 2.05) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Z-score = 1.65), both indicating a higher burden of depressive and chronic anxiety symptoms, respectively. These findings are accompanied by lower self-esteem (Z-score = -1.71) and reduced self-reported happiness (Z-score = -1.61), which are commonly associated with increased perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score with a Z-score of 1.05, exceeding the commonly accepted threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This subjective experience of poor sleep is further supported by objective wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score = 0.54), which, while not significantly below the mean, may not be sufficiently restorative given the other indicators.

In contrast to the elevated stress indicators, certain behaviors and physiological patterns appear to be neutral or potentially mitigating. The participant engages in moderate substance use (Beer and Wine/Liquor 1-2 times a week), but abstains from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is reported as 1-2 times a week for all categories (alone, with others, and sports), which aligns with general health recommendations and shows weak negative correlations with PSS. Daily recreational habits include moderate internet usage (1-2 hours) and significant time spent listening to music (2-3 hours), while activities such as watching TV/videos and video games are not engaged in. Notably, social interaction with friends is reported for 31 minutes per hour, and reading for 15 minutes or less, suggesting a balance in leisure activities. The physiological data from the wearable devices indicates a mesor (average heart rate) of 76.76 bpm, which is not substantially elevated, and a resting heart rate of 60.2 bpm. The circadian rhythm analysis shows an amplitude of 14.01 (Z-score = 1.04) and an acrophase at 5:17 PM, suggesting a regular pattern of daily heart rate variation. Interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.67) is relatively high, indicating consistent daily patterns, although intradaily variability (Z-score = 1.02) is also elevated, suggesting periods of greater physiological fluctuation within the day.

Considering the comprehensive analysis of self-report data, behavioral habits, and physiological metrics, the confluence of elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety proneness, lower self-esteem, reduced happiness, and disturbed sleep quality are strong indicators of a relatively high perceived stress level for this participant. While some behavioral and physiological metrics present a more neutral or potentially positive profile, they do not appear to outweigh the significant psychological distress reported. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is inferred to be above the population mean of 21.61."
52302,"The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be near the population mean. This is supported by a moderate score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (though the PSS score itself is not provided, the correlations and other metrics suggest this placement). Several factors contribute to this assessment. On the self-report side, the participant reports a CES-D score of 7.0, indicating no significant depressive symptoms, and an STAI score of 43.0, suggesting mild chronic anxiety, which is within a typical range. Self-esteem is relatively high at 39.0, and reported happiness is also on the higher side (4.0). Health satisfaction is 4.44, suggesting general contentment with physical health. Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Z-Score of -0.33), though this is not markedly high.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance usage and engages in regular exercise (1-2 times a week) across various modalities, including solo exercise, with others, and sports. However, daily recreation habits show a significant amount of time spent on sedentary activities, particularly video games (1.71 Z-Score), watching TV/videos/movies (1.28 Z-Score), and internet usage (2-3 hours). Conversely, reading is not a reported habit. Socializing with friends is reported for 3-4 hours daily, which is a high engagement level (1.74 Z-Score).

Physiologically, the wearable data indicates several interesting patterns. The mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is slightly below the population mean (Z-Score -0.28), and the resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-Score -0.67). Circadian rhythm stability metrics show low interdaily stability (Z-Score -0.33), suggesting some irregularity in daily routines, and low intradaily variability (Z-Score -0.95), which may indicate reduced physiological reactivity to daily events. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is higher than average (Z-Score 0.5), suggesting a greater range in heart rate fluctuations.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals periods of increased physiological arousal during midday and late evening. Specifically, deviations are notably positive between 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM (peak of 1.82 Z-Score at 2-3 PM) and again between 9:00 PM and 11:00 PM (peak of 1.04 Z-Score at 9-10 PM). Conversely, significant deviations in the negative direction, indicating lower physiological activity, are observed during the early morning hours, particularly between 4:00 AM and 7:00 AM (lowest point of -22.54 at 5-6 AM).

Sleep statistics indicate a longer than average median sleep duration (8 hours 6 minutes, Z-Score 1.14) and greater variability in sleep duration and start time compared to the population. The median sleep start time is around 1:08 AM. These findings suggest a potential for a mismatch between internal biological rhythms and external demands, which could contribute to perceived stress.

In summary, while the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms and moderate anxiety, and engages in healthy physical activity, the high engagement in sedentary leisure activities, notable variability in sleep patterns, and specific diurnal heart rate patterns, particularly elevated arousal in the late afternoon and evening, suggest a complex interplay of factors. These factors, when considered holistically, position the participant's overall perceived stress level as being near the population mean of 21.62."
46418,"The participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological and physiological indicators that collectively suggest a moderately elevated level of perceived stress, likely falling above the population mean of 21.61. This inference is supported by several factors. Notably, the participant reports a PSQI score of 11.0, which is substantially higher than the population mean and indicates significant subjective sleep disturbance (Z-score of 1.98). This aligns with a higher correlation (0.21) between poor sleep quality and perceived stress. While specific wearable sleep duration and start time data are not provided in full context, the PSQI score strongly points towards sleep as a significant contributor to perceived stress.

Further contributing to this assessment is the participant's elevated CES-D score of 18.0 (Z-score 0.49), classifying them as experiencing depressive symptoms. The positive correlation (0.28) between CES-D scores and perceived stress suggests that these symptoms are likely intertwined with their overall stress experience. Conversely, the participant's STAI-Trait score of 38.0 (Z-score -0.33) indicates a tendency towards lower chronic anxiety proneness, and their self-esteem score of 38.0 (Z-score -0.03) is near the population average, suggesting these specific psychological traits may not be primary drivers of elevated stress.

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a pattern of disrupted circadian rhythm regularity. The interdaily stability (Value 0.53, Z-score 1.0) is at the population mean, but the intradaily variability (Value 0.3, Z-score -1.73) is notably low, indicating a flatter and less dynamic heart rate pattern throughout the day. This reduced variability, combined with a significantly higher mesor (Value 78.2, Z-score 0.58) and amplitude (Value 15.07, Z-score 1.39), suggests a system that may be less responsive to daily fluctuations and potentially operating at a higher baseline. The aggregated hourly heart rate data exhibits pronounced deviations from the mesor during the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 5-6 PM with a Z-score of 2.27, 6-7 PM with a Z-score of 1.78), which could indicate periods of heightened physiological arousal or stress response that are not effectively modulated. This pattern of disrupted circadian rhythm and potentially heightened evening arousal, in conjunction with reported sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms, strongly suggests a higher perceived stress level.

In summary, the participant's perceived stress level, as inferred from the integrated multimodal data, appears to be above the population mean. The most salient indicators are the significantly disturbed sleep quality reported via the PSQI, the presence of depressive symptoms, and physiological markers suggesting a less robust circadian rhythm with notable evening arousal peaks. While trait anxiety and self-esteem do not appear to be strong contributors to elevated stress, the combination of sleep issues, mood symptoms, and physiological dysregulation points towards a substantial perceived stress burden."
93002,"The participant exhibits a perceived stress level that appears to be above the population mean. This inference is primarily supported by several indicators within the self-report survey data. Specifically, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0, with a Z-score of 1.05, suggests disturbed sleep, which is often associated with higher stress. Furthermore, the State-Trait Inventory for Anxiety-Trait (STAI) score of 40.0, while classified as ""anxious,"" has a near-average Z-score of -0.13, indicating a moderate proneness to anxiety. A positive correlation between STAI scores and PSS scores (0.31) further strengthens this interpretation. The CES-D score of 14.0, however, falls into the ""Not depressed"" category with a near-average Z-score of 0.07, suggesting that current depressive symptoms are not a primary driver of perceived stress. A relatively lower score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Z-Score of -0.87) also suggests potentially lower self-worth, which can contribute to heightened stress.

Analysis of the wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics reveals further insights into the participant's stress profile. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 28 minutes, with a Z-score of -0.88, falls below average and correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting that shorter sleep durations may contribute to increased perceived stress. This aligns with the disturbed sleep indicated by the PSQI. The participant's circadian rhythm, as indicated by Interdaily Stability (Z-Score of 0.67) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-Score of 0.81), shows a less regular pattern, with a higher Z-score on Intradaily Variability (0.58), suggesting less structured daily routines. This irregularity in daily patterns, coupled with a relatively low Mesor (Z-Score of -1.24) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-Score of -1.18), could reflect physiological responses to stress or a lifestyle that deviates from predictable rhythms. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows several periods of elevated heart rate deviation from the mesor, particularly in the late evening (e.g., 7-8 PM, Z-score 2.16) and during late night/early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM, Z-score 0.19; 4-5 AM, Z-score 0.20; 5-6 AM, Z-score 0.22). These deviations, especially during presumed rest periods, could indicate physiological arousal associated with stress.

While some behavioral habits might mitigate stress, the overall picture leans towards elevated perceived stress. The participant reports exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), which has a slight negative correlation with PSS (-0.02), and engages in socializing with friends for 1-2 hours (Z-score 0.16), showing a small negative correlation (-0.06). However, the lack of regular solo exercise (Frequency: '1-2 times a month', Z-score -0.43) and sports participation (Frequency: 'Not at all', Z-score -1.09) suggests potential limitations in stress-coping mechanisms. Furthermore, higher internet usage (Time: '2-3 hours', Z-score 0.85) and a positive correlation with PSS (0.11) could indicate a reliance on less restorative activities. Substance usage is notably absent, with Z-scores for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs all being below -0.30, suggesting this is not a factor contributing to stress. The observed median sleep duration below average, disturbed sleep quality, higher trait anxiety, and less stable daily physiological rhythms collectively point towards a perceived stress level that is above the population mean of 21.61."
56543,"This individual exhibits several indicators that may be associated with elevated perceived stress. Self-report measures reveal a heightened level of generalized anxiety proneness, as indicated by a T-score of 50 on the STAI-Trait scale, which is notably above the population mean for this trait. Furthermore, the participant reports a significant burden of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 18.0, placing them in the ""Depressed"" classification category. Subjective sleep quality is also a concern, evidenced by a PSQI score of 9.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 26 minutes, which falls below the typical recommendations for adequate rest. This is further corroborated by a high Mesor value for heart rate (82.27), suggesting a generally elevated physiological baseline. Behaviorally, the participant engages in extensive internet usage (more than 4 hours daily), which has a weak positive correlation with PSS, and a notable amount of reading time (2-3 hours daily), which shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS.

Conversely, certain data points suggest factors that may mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports relatively high self-esteem (33.0 on the RSES), which is associated with a tendency towards lower stress perception. Similarly, happiness levels are reported as moderate (3.0), with a mild negative correlation to PSS. The participant abstains from all forms of substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, which are typically not associated with increased perceived stress. While exercise frequency with others is low, and sports engagement is infrequent, the participant does report exercising alone three times a week or more, a behavior often linked to stress reduction.

Considering the totality of the data, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is likely to be above the population mean. The confluence of elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with disturbed sleep and a higher resting heart rate, strongly points towards a significant perceived stress load. While high self-esteem and absence of substance use may offer some buffering effects, they do not appear to fully offset the negative indicators. The participant's PSS score is estimated to be higher than the population mean of 21.61."
89142,"The participant exhibits several indicators potentially associated with heightened perceived stress. The STAI-Trait anxiety score is notably elevated (Z-score = 0.66), classifying the individual as anxious and correlating positively with perceived stress. This psychological disposition may contribute to a higher overall stress experience. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is below the population average (Z-score = -1.49), and the Mesor, representing the average heart rate over a 24-hour period, is also significantly lower than the population mean (Z-score = -1.89). While a lower resting heart rate can be indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, the combination with other factors warrants careful consideration. The observed hourly deviations from the Mesor suggest periods of marked physiological arousal. Specifically, the participant experiences the most substantial positive deviations from their Mesor during the late morning and early afternoon hours (e.g., 9-10 AM with a deviation of 1.69 standard deviations). Conversely, significant negative deviations occur during the late night and early morning hours, particularly between 2-5 AM, aligning with typical sleep periods. The positive deviations during waking hours may reflect physiological responses to stressors. Furthermore, the median sleep duration is significantly shorter than the population average (Z-score = -1.68), falling at approximately 5 hours and 50 minutes, which is positively correlated with perceived stress. This chronic sleep deprivation is a well-established contributor to elevated stress levels. The mean daily naps (Z-score = 0.7) are slightly above average, potentially indicating an attempt to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep.

Conversely, certain indicators suggest a potentially lower perceived stress level or contributing factors to stress reduction. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a low PSQI score (Z-score = -1.26), classifying their sleep as ""Good Sleep."" This contradicts the objective short sleep duration and suggests the participant may not perceive their sleep quality as a significant stressor. Self-reported happiness is also slightly below average (Z-score = -0.53), and health satisfaction is markedly low (Z-score = -2.45), indicating dissatisfaction with physical health. Despite the low resting heart rate and Mesor, the amplitude of heart rate variation is near the population average (Z-score = -0.07), suggesting a typical range of physiological fluctuation throughout the day. The interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score = 0.33) is slightly above average, implying a degree of regularity in daily physiological rhythms. Furthermore, the participant engages in activities that are generally considered beneficial for stress management, such as significant time spent reading (Z-score = 2.28) and moderate time spent listening to music (Z-score = 0.21) and engaging in video games (Z-score = 1.71). Notably, substance usage across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with corresponding low Z-scores, indicating abstention. Similarly, engagement in exercise, both alone and with others, and sports is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-scores ranging from -1.93 to -1.09), which, while potentially indicative of reduced physical activity, does not directly suggest stress-inducing behaviors.

Overall, the data present a complex picture of perceived stress. While the elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and significantly short sleep duration are strong indicators of heightened stress, the good subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and engagement in certain recreational activities offer counterbalancing elements. The low resting heart rate and Mesor, coupled with significant negative deviations during sleep, might reflect a physiological pattern that, while indicating less intense physiological arousal during typical waking hours, could be challenged by the chronic sleep deficit. Given the positive correlation between sleep duration and perceived stress, and the elevated trait anxiety, it is likely that the participant's perceived stress level is **above the population mean**. The lower-than-average health satisfaction further supports this conclusion, suggesting a general sense of well-being may be compromised."
24898,"The participant exhibits a complex profile that suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, likely near the population mean. Several self-reported survey measures provide insight into psychological states that may contribute to or be indicative of perceived stress. The Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 45.0, with a Z-score of 0.37, falls into the ""anxious"" classification, indicating a tendency towards higher chronic anxiety compared to the population. This is further supported by a positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress. While the CES-D score (14.0) indicates a lack of significant depressive symptoms, the elevated anxiety proneness suggests a heightened baseline sensitivity to stressors. Conversely, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Score: 31.0, Z-Score: -1.01), which typically acts as a buffer against stress, and a higher self-reported happiness (Current: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55). Health satisfaction is also moderately high (Score: 5.44, Z-score: 0.88). Substance usage is minimal, and engagement in physical activities, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports, is notably high (Z-scores of 1.07, 1.23, and 1.58 respectively), suggesting proactive engagement in health-promoting behaviors. The participant also dedicates considerable time to reading (Z-Score: 2.28) and listening to music (Z-Score: 2.06), which may serve as stress-reduction mechanisms.

However, certain behavioral and physiological metrics indicate patterns that might be associated with elevated stress. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, with a Z-score of -1.18, suggests shorter sleep than the population average, and this metric shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress. The PSQI score of 6.0, while not extremely high, falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, indicating a subjective experience of poorer sleep quality, which often correlates with stress. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant deviations from the mesor during specific periods. Notably, the heart rate is substantially lower than the mesor during the late night and early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM: Z-score -2.36, 2-3 AM: Z-score -2.31, 3-4 AM: Z-score -2.2, 4-5 AM: Z-score -2.22, 5-6 AM: Z-score -1.54), consistent with sleep. Conversely, there are periods of significant elevation above the mesor during the daytime, particularly between 2-3 PM (Z-score 2.62) and 6-7 PM (Z-score 2.15), and also between 7-8 AM (Z-score 2.41) and 8-9 AM (Z-score 1.52), suggesting periods of physiological arousal that could be linked to perceived stress. The mesor itself (71.55, Z-score -0.33) is near the population average, but the amplitude of the circadian rhythm (15.84, Z-score 1.64) is notably higher, indicating a larger daily fluctuation in heart rate, which can be associated with stress. The Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.65, Z-Score: 1.99) is significantly high, indicating a highly regular daily routine, which can be protective against stress, but the Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.34, Z-Score: -1.45) is lower than average, suggesting less fluctuation within the day.

In conclusion, the participant presents a profile of moderate perceived stress. Elevated trait anxiety and shorter sleep durations point towards factors contributing to a higher stress experience. These are counterbalanced by strong self-esteem, high happiness, significant engagement in health-promoting behaviors (exercise, reading, listening to music), and a highly stable daily routine, which are generally associated with lower stress. The observed significant heart rate deviations during the day, particularly in the afternoon and early evening, coupled with a higher amplitude in circadian rhythm, suggest periods of increased physiological arousal that align with a higher perceived stress level. Based on the provided population data (Mean PSS: 21.61, SD: 3.68, 50th percentile: 22.0), and considering the combination of anxiety proneness and physiological indicators of arousal that may offset protective factors, the participant's overall perceived stress level is inferred to be near the population mean."
74413,"The participant's perceived stress level, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) data (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68), appears to be **near the population mean**. This inference is drawn from a comprehensive analysis of self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological and behavioral metrics.

Several indicators suggest a lower perceived stress level. The participant reports very low levels of anxiety proneness (STAI score of 31.0, Z-score = -1.02) and depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 6.0, Z-score = -0.76), both classifying as ""not anxious"" and ""not depressed"" respectively. Self-esteem is reported as relatively high (SelfEsteem score of 46.0, Z-score = 1.1). Furthermore, the participant engages in relatively frequent solo exercise (""Exercised Alone"" frequency: ""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score = 1.07), indicating a proactive engagement in health-promoting behaviors. Substance usage for beer, wine or liquor, and recreational drugs are reported as ""Not at all,"" with significantly negative Z-scores, suggesting low engagement in these behaviors. Daily recreational habits indicate minimal engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and video games, with substantial positive Z-scores for ""Reading"" (Time: ""16-30 minutes,"" Z-score = 1.3). The participant also reports a relatively low median sleep duration standard deviation (42 minutes, Z-score = -1.34), suggesting consistent sleep timing.

Conversely, some data points suggest potential contributors to or correlates of higher perceived stress. The participant's Intradaily Variability in heart rate is notably high (Value = 0.76, Z-score = 1.51), indicating greater fluctuation in heart rate throughout the day, which can be indicative of physiological arousal or dysregulation. Additionally, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals several periods of elevated deviation from the mesor, particularly in the late evening (10-11 PM, deviation = 22.05, Z-score = 2.46) and early morning (12-1 AM, deviation = 7.42, Z-score = 1.32). The participant also reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (Score = 6.0, Z-Score = -0.33), although this score is only slightly above the common threshold for clinically significant disturbance. While not directly correlated with PSS, the Body Mass Index of 27.12 falls within the overweight category. The participant's engagement with ""Internet Usage"" is notably low (""Do not do,"" Z-score = -2.5), which, while not inherently stressful, could indicate a lack of engagement in common social or informational activities. The Acorphase of 6:27 PM, while specific, needs to be interpreted in conjunction with other rhythm metrics.

In summary, the participant exhibits several traits and behaviors typically associated with lower perceived stress, including good mental health indicators, high self-esteem, regular physical activity, and controlled substance use. However, the high intradaily variability in heart rate and elevated heart rate deviations during specific late-night and early-morning hours, coupled with a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep, suggest areas where physiological stress responses may be present. Given the balance of these indicators, the participant's overall perceived stress level is assessed as being near the population mean."
77789,"This participant presents with a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that collectively inform an assessment of perceived stress. The **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)** score is inferred to be *above the population mean* of 21.62, given the clustering of several indicators associated with higher stress.

Several self-report survey measures suggest elevated levels of psychological distress and potentially related behavioral patterns. The **CES-D score of 20.0** indicates a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, which correlates positively (0.28) with PSS scores. Similarly, the **STAI-Trait score of 43.0** falls within the anxious classification and shows a moderate positive correlation (0.31) with PSS, suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety. While self-esteem is not critically low (Z-score of -0.31), and health satisfaction is somewhat lower than average (Z-score of -0.86), these are less direct indicators of acute stress. The **PSQI score of 6.0** signifies disturbed sleep quality, a known correlate and contributor to perceived stress. Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports engaging in wine or liquor consumption 1-2 times a month, which is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.19), and moderates their drinking of beer to less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score of -0.41). Their engagement in social activities is also lower than average, with ""Socializing with Friends"" time reported as 31 minutes to an hour (Z-score of -0.62), and ""Exercised with Others"" and ""Sports"" frequencies being notably low (Z-scores of -1.58 and -1.09, respectively). Conversely, the participant demonstrates higher than average engagement in reading (Z-score of 1.3), which is inversely correlated with PSS (-0.21).

Physiological and wearable data offer further insights into potential stress-related patterns. The **mesor of 83.16** is notably above the population mean (Z-score of 1.26), indicating a higher average heart rate. This is further supported by a **resting heart rate of 68.7**, which is also elevated relative to the population (Z-score of 1.25), suggesting a generally heightened physiological arousal state. The **Sleep Statistics** reveal a **median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes**, which is below average (Z-score of -0.8), and a **sleep duration standard deviation of 166 minutes**, which is considerably higher than the population average (Z-score of 1.49), indicating significant variability in sleep length. The **median sleep start time of 01:19:14** and its standard deviation (Z-score of -0.45) suggest a somewhat irregular sleep schedule, particularly in terms of consistency. The **interdaily stability of 0.49** (Z-score of 0.67) suggests a less regular daily behavioral rhythm. Analysis of **Mean Aggregate Deviation From Mesor** reveals distinct patterns of elevated heart rate during the day, particularly between 8-9 AM (Z-score of 1.71) and 7-8 PM (Z-score of -1.07), with lower deviations during early morning hours. The **intradaily variability of 0.49** (Z-score of -0.39) and **autocorrelation at 24 hours of 0.28** (Z-score of -0.36) do not strongly suggest severe disruption to the circadian rhythm structure itself, although the acrophase at 4:00 PM is noted.

In summary, the participant's profile is characterized by elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, disturbed sleep quantity and variability, a higher-than-average baseline heart rate and mesor, and generally lower engagement in social and group physical activities. While a strong indicator of reading frequency and a generally consistent acrophase suggest some structured engagement, the preponderance of evidence, particularly from psychological surveys and sleep metrics, points towards an overall perceived stress level that is likely **above the population mean**."
88882,"The participant's self-reported data suggest a generally positive psychological and lifestyle profile, with some indicators potentially correlating with lower perceived stress. Their reported scores on the CES-D (2.0) and STAI (28.0) fall within the ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" classifications, respectively, with Z-scores indicating these are considerably lower than the population mean. Similarly, self-esteem (46.0) is above average, and current happiness (5.0) is notably high, with a Z-score of 1.64, suggesting a robust sense of well-being. Health satisfaction (5.0) is also above the midpoint of the scale. Behavioral habits indicate moderate substance usage (beer 1-2 times a week, wine/liquor 1-2 times a month) and a high frequency of exercising alone (three times a week or more). Notably, time spent on activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and socializing with friends are all at or below average durations, with reading being entirely absent and sedentary hobbies also not engaged in.

Conversely, certain physiological and behavioral metrics may suggest areas of potential stress or disruption. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep, falling just above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Sleep duration is notably short, with a median of 5 hours and 57 minutes, significantly below the population average (Z-score of -1.53). The median sleep start time is also very late, at 02:34:14. Wearable data reveals higher than average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score of 0.60), suggesting less stable physiological regulation throughout the day. Several hourly deviations from the mesor show marked elevations during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g., 1-2 am, 8-9 pm, 9-10 pm), with the 1-2 am period showing a particularly high deviation of 14.11 (Z-score of 3.1). The mean resting heart rate is also relatively low (47.35, Z-score of -1.28), though this in itself does not necessarily indicate stress.

When considering the aggregate of these data points, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to be **near the population mean**. While strong indicators of positive psychological well-being and moderate lifestyle engagement are present, the significant sleep disturbances and associated physiological patterns suggest a potential countervailing influence on perceived stress. The relatively low sleep duration and late sleep onset, combined with heightened physiological activity during nighttime hours, could contribute to a baseline level of stress that moderates the positive self-report measures. The PSQI score, indicative of disturbed sleep, further supports this interpretation."
19245,"The participant exhibits a complex profile that, when holistically considered, suggests a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean. Several self-report measures indicate psychological distress, with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 26.0 (Z-score 1.32) and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 55.0 (Z-score 1.35) both falling into classifications of ""Depressed"" and ""anxious,"" respectively. These scores are significantly above the population mean as indicated by their positive Z-scores. Concurrently, self-reported happiness is notably low, with a current happiness score of 2.0 (Z-score -1.61), further supporting a state of reduced well-being. While self-esteem is within a more average range (Z-score -0.45), the combination of elevated depressive and anxious symptomatology, coupled with low happiness, strongly points towards a higher perceived stress burden.

Behavioral patterns also contribute to this interpretation, albeit with some nuances. The participant reports moderate substance usage, with beer consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-score 1.01), which is more frequent than the population average. While alcohol and recreational drug usage are less frequent, the overall pattern of substance engagement may reflect coping mechanisms. In terms of recreation, there is a significant allocation of time to activities such as listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95), and a considerable amount of time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64). Conversely, dedicated reading time is minimal (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32). The relatively low engagement in structured exercise, with sports occurring only 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.25) and exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), alongside higher frequency of exercising alone (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), suggests a potentially uneven approach to physical activity as a stress regulator. Furthermore, a notable observation is the high Body Mass Index (29.16), which is often associated with various health concerns and can be influenced by stress levels.

Wearable data reveals patterns that are consistent with a disrupted physiological rhythm, potentially exacerbating perceived stress. The median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score 1.14) is within a generally healthy range, however, the significant standard deviation in sleep duration (155 minutes, Z-score 1.23) and sleep start time (125 minutes, Z-score 0.92) indicates considerable sleep variability. This irregularity in sleep can be a significant contributor to elevated stress. The circadian rhythm metrics, specifically interdaily stability (0.31, Z-score -0.82) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.31, Z-score -0.11), suggest a weaker than average temporal regularity in daily routines. The Mesor (66.42, Z-score -1.03) and Amplitude (10.08, Z-score -0.23) of the heart rate rhythm are lower than population averages, indicating a less pronounced diurnal variation in heart rate. Notably, the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor shows significant positive deviations during the late evening and early night (e.g., 10-11 PM: 20.73, Z-score 2.25; 11 PM-12 AM: 16.74, Z-score 1.98), suggesting periods of heightened physiological arousal that are not well-aligned with typical rest periods. Conversely, there are pronounced negative deviations during the morning hours (e.g., 4-6 AM), which might indicate an impaired ability to transition into a fully alert state. The resting heart rate (49.6, Z-score -1.02) is below average, which in isolation might suggest good cardiovascular fitness, but in the context of other data, it could also reflect a state of chronic physiological activation or dysregulation. The substantial mean daily naps (0.27, Z-score 2.27) further underscore potential disruption in the sleep-wake cycle.

In conclusion, the participant's psychological profile, characterized by elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self-reported happiness, and significant sleep and circadian rhythm irregularities, strongly suggests a higher perceived stress level. This is further supported by moderate substance usage and a less structured approach to daily activities and exercise. The combination of these factors indicates a perceived stress level that is notably above the population mean of 21.6."
83748,"The analysis of perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), reveals a complex interplay of self-reported psychological states, behavioral patterns, and physiological metrics. This participant's profile indicates a perceived stress level that is likely above the population mean, given the collective evidence.

Several self-report measures suggest potential contributors to higher perceived stress. While the participant reports not being chronically anxious (STAI Z-score of -1.71) and not experiencing significant depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score of -0.45), they exhibit notably low self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score of 1.52) and lower than average levels of happiness (Happy Z-score of 1.64). Furthermore, the participant reports lower overall satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score of 0.72) and a relatively low Body Mass Index of 17.74, which may reflect underlying health concerns or self-perception issues contributing to stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) indicates disturbed sleep, scoring above the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in higher-than-average frequencies of exercising alone and with others, and participating in sports, which could be a coping mechanism for stress, though the specific impact on perceived stress is not directly indicated by correlations. However, their engagement in sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and socializing with friends is considerably lower than the population average. Internet usage and reading are within or slightly above average ranges. Substance usage, including beer, wine, liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, is reported as less than 1-2 times a month or not at all, aligning with lower levels of risk-associated behaviors.

Physiological metrics from the wearable data provide additional insights. The participant exhibits lower-than-average mesor (69.43, Z-score -0.62) and amplitude (10.25, Z-score -0.17) in their heart rate circadian rhythm, suggesting a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate. Their interdaily stability (0.37, Z-score -0.33) is also below average, indicating less regularity in daily patterns, while intradaily variability (0.56, Z-score 0.1) is near the average. The autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.22, Z-score -0.87) is notably low, suggesting a weak tendency for daily heart rate patterns to repeat. Sleep duration is slightly shorter than the population average (Median Sleep Duration of 6 hours 54 minutes, Z-score -0.35), and sleep start times are less consistent (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation of 41 minutes, Z-score -0.93), potentially contributing to sleep disturbance.

The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight periods of significantly elevated physiological arousal during the evening and late night, particularly between 11 PM and 12 AM (26.98, Z-score 3.51), 6 PM and 7 PM (27.97, Z-score 2.67), and 5 PM and 6 PM (22.09, Z-score 1.69), and 10 PM and 11 PM (17.14, Z-score 1.68). These periods of high cardiovascular activity in the evening and before sleep may indicate physiological responses to stress or other factors impacting arousal levels, potentially disrupting sleep and contributing to higher perceived stress.

Overall, while the participant does not report high levels of anxiety or depression, the combination of low self-esteem, lower happiness, disturbed sleep, and particularly the pronounced evening and late-night physiological arousal patterns in heart rate data suggests a profile indicative of elevated perceived stress. These factors, when considered holistically, place the participant's perceived stress level likely above the population mean of 21.62."
63347,"The participant exhibits several indicators that suggest a relatively elevated level of perceived stress. The higher than average Mesor (mean heart rate), with a Z-score of 1.13, and a notably high amplitude (Z-score of 1.69) for their heart rate circadian rhythm point towards increased physiological arousal and potentially greater daily fluctuations in cardiovascular activity. This is further supported by significant positive deviations from the mesor during evening and late night hours, particularly between 7-8 PM (Z-score 2.29) and 8-9 PM (Z-score 1.58), and also elevated deviations from 9-11 PM. The reduced interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.58) of their heart rate, though not extremely high, suggests less regularity in daily physiological patterns. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality, indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0 (above the typical threshold of 5 for significant disturbance), and a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 49 minutes, which is below average for the study population (Z-score -0.46). Additionally, the participant reports higher than average trait anxiety (STAI score of 45.0, Z-score 0.37) and a tendency towards being 'anxious', alongside a moderate CES-D score of 14.0, suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptoms than the average non-depressed individual. Lower than average self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78) also align with a higher stress profile.

Conversely, certain behavioral patterns and metrics do not strongly indicate high perceived stress. The participant's high GPA (3.95 and 3.88 for Fall semesters) suggests academic functioning is not being severely impacted by stress. Their substance usage is minimal, with beer and wine/liquor consumed less than 1-2 times a month, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs not at all. Exercise is notably absent, with zero reported frequency for exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, and very limited daily engagement in leisure activities like watching TV/videos/movies (15 minutes or less). While the intention of these behaviors might be stress-reducing, their absence does not contribute to mitigating perceived stress. Daily recreation habits are generally low, with the exception of video games and sedentary hobbies at 15 minutes or less, and moderate internet and music listening at 16-30 minutes. The lower than average autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.98) might imply less consistency in daily routines, which can sometimes be associated with lower stress, but the other circadian rhythm metrics point more strongly towards disruption.

Overall, the participant's perceived stress level appears to be **above the population mean** for the study sample. The confluence of elevated physiological arousal markers (Mesor, Amplitude, significant late-day heart rate deviations), reported sleep disturbances, higher trait anxiety, and lower self-reported happiness and health satisfaction strongly suggest a subjective experience of higher perceived stress, even in the context of strong academic performance and low substance use. The lack of engagement in stress-mitigating activities like exercise further supports this conclusion."
