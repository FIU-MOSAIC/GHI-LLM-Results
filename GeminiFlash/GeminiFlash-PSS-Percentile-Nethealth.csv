44869,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by significant physiological arousal, severe sleep disturbances, and elevated depressive symptoms, despite some areas of psychological strength and stable academic performance. This complex picture points towards a heightened state of perceived stress.

Psychologically, the participant reports elevated depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 22.0 (Z-score 0.9), placing them nearly one standard deviation above the population mean and within a range indicative of clinical depression. Concurrently, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53). While trait anxiety as measured by the STAI is within the average range (Z-score -0.23), its positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31) suggests it may still contribute to their stress experience. Counterbalancing these findings, the participant exhibits high self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and reports above-average satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 0.55), which could serve as protective factors or indicate specific areas of well-being. Academically, the participant demonstrates strong performance, with their most recent GPA being 3.7.

A critical aspect of this participant's profile is pronounced sleep disruption. Subjectively, their sleep quality is notably poor, indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0, placing them more than 1.5 standard deviations above the population mean and classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" Objective wearable data reinforces this by revealing highly irregular sleep patterns. Although the median sleep duration is long at 8 hours and 26 minutes (Z-score 1.55), the consistency of sleep is severely compromised. Both the standard deviation of sleep duration (193 minutes, Z-score 2.09) and sleep start time (157 minutes, Z-score 1.63) are exceptionally high, indicating substantial day-to-day variability in when they go to bed and how long they sleep. These high variabilities are positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting their irregular sleep patterns contribute to their overall stress burden despite ample total sleep time.

Physiologically, the participant displays clear and substantial markers of chronic arousal. Their resting heart rate of 78.4 bpm is remarkably elevated, exceeding the population mean by over two standard deviations (Z-score 2.41). Similarly, their mean heart rate over the entire recording period (Mesor) is also very high at 88.34 bpm (Z-score 1.97). Both high resting heart rate and high mesor are strong physiological indicators of chronic stress and heightened sympathetic nervous system activity. The circadian rhythm analysis further highlights dysregulation, with a notably low amplitude (Z-score -0.91), suggesting a blunted daily fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates, often observed in states of chronic stress. Intradaily variability is also elevated (Z-score 1.16), consistent with less stable physiological patterns throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:09 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show that while heart rates drop significantly during early morning hours, these drops are more pronounced (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM with positive Z-scores for negative deviations) relative to the participant's own high mesor, potentially reflecting the body's intensified effort to achieve recovery from a persistently elevated baseline.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. Reported exercise frequencies are consistently low, and they engage in sedentary hobbies for more than four hours daily, a habit that is significantly above the population mean (Z-score 3.19). While the participant abstains from all reported substance use, their recreational activities are largely passive, involving 2-3 hours daily of watching TV/videos and listening to music, both exceeding average population engagement. Despite their academic successes and some positive self-perceptions, the pervasive physiological arousal, sleep disarray, and largely sedentary habits collectively suggest a system under considerable strain, likely contributing to an elevated experience of perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The aggregate data provides substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would likely place them in the top 50% of the study population.

1.  **Profound Physiological Arousal:** The most compelling indicators are the extremely elevated Resting Heart Rate (78.4 bpm; Z-score 2.41) and Mesor (88.34 bpm; Z-score 1.97). These physiological markers are more than two standard deviations above the population mean, reflecting chronic sympathetic nervous system activation, a hallmark of sustained stress. Both metrics also exhibit positive correlations with PSS, underscoring their relevance to perceived stress. The low amplitude in the circadian heart rate rhythm (Z-score -0.91) further supports a state of physiological dysregulation often associated with chronic stress.

2.  **Severe Sleep Disturbances:** The participant reports significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 10.0; Z-score 1.52), a strong predictor of increased perceived stress. Objectively, despite long sleep durations, the extreme variability in both sleep duration (193 minutes; Z-score 2.09) and sleep start time (157 minutes; Z-score 1.63) signifies highly irregular sleep patterns. These high variabilities are positively correlated with PSS, indicating that inconsistent sleep contributes to higher perceived stress.

3.  **Elevated Psychological Distress:** The participant's elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D score 22.0; Z-score 0.9; correlation 0.28) and below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53; correlation -0.19) are closely associated with higher perceived stress. While trait anxiety is average, its positive correlation with PSS further aligns with an elevated stress experience.

4.  **Sedentary Lifestyle:** The participant's minimal engagement in exercise and extremely high time spent on sedentary hobbies (Z-score 3.19) are behavioral patterns generally linked to poorer physical and mental health outcomes, including higher stress levels.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Fewer indicators suggest a low or median PSS score.

1.  **High Self-Esteem and Health Satisfaction:** The participant reports high self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55). High self-esteem is typically considered a protective psychological resource against stress, and these factors have mild negative correlations with PSS.

2.  **Abstinence from Substance Use:** The participant reports no usage of various substances, a healthy behavior that is generally associated with better mental health. However, the correlations with PSS are negligible or slightly negative, suggesting this factor does not strongly mitigate the more prominent stressors.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Upon holistic evaluation, the cumulative evidence strongly points towards the participant experiencing a high level of perceived stress. The profound physiological signs of chronic arousal (extremely high resting and mesor heart rates), coupled with severe subjective and objective sleep disturbances (poor quality, extreme variability), and elevated depressive symptoms, are robust indicators. While positive self-esteem, health satisfaction, and substance abstinence offer some protective factors, their magnitude and number are outweighed by the pervasive physiological and sleep dysregulation, and psychological distress. The consistent positive correlations between the most significant problematic metrics (e.g., RHR, sleep variability, CES-D) and PSS further solidify this conclusion. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level falls within the top 50% of the study population.

92552,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several noteworthy characteristics, some of which suggest elevated internal distress, while others may serve as protective factors. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is classified as ""anxious"" with a Z-score of 0.37, suggesting a predisposition towards experiencing anxiety that is somewhat above the population average. Similarly, depressive symptoms assessed by the CESD are slightly elevated (Z-score of 0.18), although the score does not classify them as clinically depressed. In contrast, self-esteem is notably high (Z-score of 0.82), a factor that typically correlates negatively with perceived stress and may serve as a psychological buffer. Current self-reported happiness is also above average (Z-score of 0.55). However, a moderately low level of satisfaction with physical health (Z-score of -0.78) points to a potential area of concern within their overall well-being. Furthermore, a declining trend in academic performance, as evidenced by decreasing GPAs across recent semesters, may represent an ongoing stressor or consequence of underlying difficulties.

Sleep patterns exhibit significant disturbances, both subjectively and objectively. The participant's PSQI score of 8 (Z-score of 0.59) classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating self-reported poor sleep quality and related difficulties. Objectively, while median sleep duration is slightly longer than average (7 hours 49 minutes, Z-score of 0.79), there is a substantial lack of consistency in sleep timing and duration, reflected by a high standard deviation in sleep duration (174 minutes, Z-score of 1.66) and a moderately high standard deviation in sleep start time (94 minutes, Z-score of 0.25). This suggests highly irregular sleep-wake schedules. Additionally, the participant reports a significantly higher frequency of napping (mean daily naps Z-score of 1.75), which can further indicate fragmented nocturnal sleep or an attempt to compensate for sleep deficits. The combination of self-reported poor sleep quality and objective inconsistency points to a potentially taxing sleep environment or underlying issues that can contribute to perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveals a highly anomalous and potentially dysregulated circadian rhythm of heart rate. Despite the participant exhibiting a generally low mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score of -1.49) and resting heart rate (Z-score of -1.11), which could suggest good cardiovascular fitness at baseline, the hourly deviations from their individual Mesor present an unusual pattern of physiological arousal. Specifically, there are profoundly elevated heart rates during early morning hours (12 AM - 4 AM), with Z-scores for these hourly deviations reaching up to 4.03 (2-3 AM). This indicates extreme physiological arousal occurring when typically in deep sleep. Notably, even at 4-5 AM, where the heart rate is below the participant's Mesor, the deviation is still comparatively elevated (Z-score of 1.43) relative to what the study population typically experiences at that hour. Conversely, heart rates during mid-morning to early afternoon (10 AM - 2 PM) are significantly lower than the participant's Mesor, with Z-scores for these deviations dropping to -3.45, suggesting reduced activity during typical active hours. This inverted or severely disrupted daily physiological cycle, where the body's peak activity occurs during typical resting hours, and a trough occurs during typical active hours, is further supported by a late acrophase (8:48 PM). While interdaily stability is average, intradaily variability is moderately elevated (Z-score of 0.32), consistent with a less predictable and more fragmented physiological activity pattern throughout the day. This widespread physiological dysregulation points to a system under chronic strain or struggling with adaptational demands.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports engaging in alcohol consumption with frequencies of ""1-2 times a week"" for both beer (Z-score of 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score of 0.94), placing them notably above the population average for these activities. Participation in recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""not at all."" Exercise habits are moderate, with individual exercise occurring ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score of 0.32) and less frequent engagement in group exercise or sports. Recreational time is spent moderately on internet usage and listening to music (both 1-2 hours), while engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos (Z-score of -1.25, ""Do not do"") and reading (Z-score of -0.67, ""Do not do"") is notably low. The correlation data suggests that lower engagement in reading is associated with higher PSS. This pattern of recreational activity and substance use, particularly the high alcohol consumption, may be relevant to the participant's overall well-being and stress management strategies.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Analysis of Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**
Evidence suggesting a potentially lower or average perceived stress level includes a notably high self-esteem score (Z-score = 0.82) which has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.15), implying a buffering effect against stress. Additionally, the participant reports above-average current happiness (Z-score = 0.55), which also negatively correlates with PSS (-0.19). Objectively, a low resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.11) and Mesor (Z-score = -1.49) could indicate good cardiovascular health, which is generally protective against stress if the overall physiological pattern is healthy. Engagement in some social activities and moderate physical exercise also offer potential stress-reducing benefits.

**Analysis of Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%)**
Conversely, a substantial body of evidence points towards an elevated perceived stress level. The participant exhibits above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.37, classified as 'anxious') and moderately elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = 0.18), both of which show positive correlations with PSS (0.31 and 0.28, respectively). A key indicator is the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification from the PSQI (score 8, Z-score = 0.59), which strongly suggests compromised mental health and is a common correlate of high stress. Objective sleep data further corroborates this with a very high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.66) and frequent napping (Z-score = 1.75), signifying highly inconsistent and fragmented sleep patterns. The most compelling physiological evidence comes from the profoundly dysregulated hourly heart rate patterns: extreme heart rate elevations during typical sleep hours (Z-scores up to 4.03 between 2-3 AM) coupled with unusually low heart rates during peak daytime activity. This inverted and erratic physiological arousal indicates significant chronic strain or maladaptation. The positive correlations of early morning heart rate elevations (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM) with PSS further strengthen this interpretation. Additional indicators include lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -0.78), a declining GPA trend, and relatively high alcohol consumption, which can be both a stressor and a maladaptive coping mechanism.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence for elevated perceived stress significantly outweighs the indicators for lower stress. While high self-esteem and happiness might offer some resilience, the pervasive issues across self-reported sleep quality, objective sleep consistency, and profound physiological dysregulation of circadian heart rate patterns are highly indicative of a system under considerable stress. The elevated self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with declining academic performance, provide a psychological and behavioral context consistent with high perceived stress. The extreme nature of the early morning heart rate spikes, in particular, suggests a state of chronic physiological arousal or disrupted recuperation. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level falls within the top 50% of the study population.

73158,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a remarkably robust psychological profile, characterized by exceptionally low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 0.0, Z-score -1.38) and trait anxiety (STAI score 24.0, Z-score -1.71), placing them well below the population average for these distress indicators. Concurrently, self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and self-esteem (Z-score 1.66) are notably high, indicative of a strong sense of personal well-being. This positive self-perception extends to health satisfaction, which is also above average (Z-score 0.8). These combined psychological traits are generally associated with greater resilience and lower perceived stress.

In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant consistently maintains a high academic performance, with GPAs consistently near 3.9. Lifestyle choices reflect a complete abstinence from all surveyed substances. Exercise habits present a mixed profile: while engagement in exercising alone (Z-score -0.43) and sports (Z-score -1.09) is below average, participation in exercising with others is notably high (Z-score 1.23), suggesting a preference for social physical activity. Leisure activities include above-average engagement in screen-based recreation such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and video games (Z-score 0.96), but below-average participation in other solitary hobbies like reading and listening to music. Socializing with friends is also reported to be below the population average (Z-score -0.62). This suggests a lifestyle that balances academic rigor and social exercise with significant screen time and less engagement in some traditionally stress-reducing solitary activities or extensive social interaction.

Objective wearable data reveals that the participant experiences consistently short sleep durations, averaging 6 hours and 11 minutes per night (Z-score -1.25), which is significantly below the study population median. Sleep onset is consistently late, around 11:35 PM, with relatively low day-to-day variability in both duration (Z-score 0.08) and start time (Z-score -0.36), and no reported napping. This pattern indicates a stable, albeit restricted, sleep schedule. Interestingly, despite this objectively short sleep, the participant subjectively reports good sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI score 4.0, Z-score -1.26), suggesting they do not perceive their sleep duration or quality as problematic.

Physiological data derived from heart rate exhibits strong indicators of cardiovascular health and well-defined circadian rhythms. The participant has a remarkably low resting heart rate of 48.2 bpm (Z-score -1.18) and a low overall heart rate mesor of 65.92 bpm (Z-score -1.1), indicative of excellent cardiovascular fitness. The heart rate-based circadian rhythm displays an average amplitude (Z-score 0.04) with a peak (acrophase) occurring around 1:01 PM. Hourly deviations from the mesor highlight a pronounced and rapid physiological activation in the early morning hours (e.g., 5-6 AM Z-score 3.1, 6-7 AM Z-score 4.41), signifying an energetic and swift transition from the rest phase to the active phase of the day. While interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z-score -0.16), suggesting minor day-to-day variability in rhythm patterns, intradaily variability is low (Z-score -0.74), indicating smoother and less fragmented physiological activity within each day. These combined physiological patterns underscore a robust individual with well-regulated, albeit slightly less stable across days, circadian rhythms.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The predominant evidence strongly suggests the participant's perceived stress level falls within the bottom half of the study population. Self-reported measures are particularly indicative, with extremely low scores on the CES-D (Z-score -1.38) and STAI-Trait (Z-score -1.71), reflecting minimal depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Both these metrics show positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31 respectively), meaning lower scores here are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports high levels of happiness (Z-score 1.64) and self-esteem (Z-score 1.66), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, acting as psychological buffers against stress. Subjective sleep quality is also reported as good (PSQI Z-score -1.26). Physiologically, the participant exhibits excellent cardiovascular health, characterized by a very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.18) and low heart rate mesor (Z-score -1.1), which typically correlates with lower physiological strain and stress. Engagement in social exercise (Z-score 1.23) also represents a positive coping behavior.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Some factors, though less impactful in this holistic analysis, could theoretically contribute to perceived stress. The participant's objective sleep duration is notably short (6 hours 11 minutes, Z-score -1.25). While the self-reported PSQI indicates good subjective sleep quality for this individual, chronically short sleep can, for some, contribute to physiological stress, even if not consciously perceived as poor quality. Additionally, slightly below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.11) in circadian rhythms might suggest minor irregularities, with their weak negative correlations to PSS implying a very slight link to higher stress. However, these physiological nuances are minor compared to the overwhelming indicators of psychological well-being. Lower engagement in social activities (Z-score -0.62) and certain solitary hobbies could also potentially limit stress-buffering outlets, but the correlations with PSS are negligible.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the extensive and robust evidence from self-report questionnaires, particularly the exceptionally low scores for anxiety and depressive symptoms and high scores for happiness and self-esteem, are powerful indicators of low perceived stress. These strong psychological protective factors, coupled with excellent cardiovascular health and a subjective perception of good sleep despite objectively short duration, far outweigh the minor physiological irregularities or behavioral patterns that could otherwise suggest elevated stress. Therefore, the participant's overall profile strongly indicates a low level of perceived stress relative to the study population.

45963,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates a significant burden of mental health symptoms and diminished well-being. They report markedly elevated trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 62.0 (Z-score 2.05), classifying them as anxious and correlating positively with perceived stress. Depressive symptoms are also above average, reflected by a CESD score of 22.0 (Z-score 0.9). Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score -1.15) and self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) are significantly below the population average, both negatively correlating with perceived stress. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is considerably lower than the mean (Z-score -1.28). While the participant demonstrates high academic performance across multiple semesters, this does not mitigate the observed psychological distress.

Analysis of sleep and circadian rhythms reveals substantial disturbance and irregularity. The participant reports subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0, Z-score 0.13). Objectively, sleep patterns show below-average median sleep duration (6 hours 40 minutes) and, more notably, extremely high variability in sleep start time (Z-score 2.89) and above-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.32). These indicators of irregular sleep schedules are positively correlated with perceived stress. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further support this pattern of disruption, with markedly poor interdaily stability (Z-score -2.06), indicating inconsistent day-to-day rhythmicity, and a significantly blunted physiological amplitude (Z-score -2.13), suggesting a reduced dynamic range in cardiovascular activity over a 24-hour cycle. Both of these metrics are negatively correlated with perceived stress, reinforcing the link between circadian disruption and elevated stress. The participant also exhibits an above-average resting heart rate (Z-score 1.2) and a higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.07), suggesting a state of elevated baseline physiological arousal, both positively correlated with perceived stress. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:11 PM.

An examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrates distinct patterns of physiological arousal. During typical nocturnal hours (e.g., 1 AM to 7 AM), heart rate, while below the individual's mesor, is relatively elevated compared to the population average for those hours (positive Z-scores for typically negative deviations). This suggests a less pronounced nocturnal heart rate dip, indicative of sustained physiological activation during periods generally associated with deep rest, with these relative elevations positively correlating with perceived stress. Conversely, during certain daytime hours, particularly from approximately 1 PM to 9 PM, the participant's heart rate tends to be relatively lower than the population average for those specific times (negative Z-scores). This overall daily heart rate profile suggests a reduced and somewhat irregular daily physiological range, with a tendency towards elevated heart rate during sleep periods relative to their peers.

Behavioral habits present a mixed profile. The participant engages in above-average use of wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94), which shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. Exercise patterns include above-average participation in sports (Z-score 0.91) and exercising with others (Z-score 0.53), both weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting these activities may be associated with slightly lower stress. However, there is no reported solitary exercise (Z-score -1.93). Daily recreation habits indicate minimal engagement in passive activities such as watching TV or playing video games. Time spent listening to music is above average (Z-score 1.13) and internet usage and socializing with friends are average. Notably, the participant reports no reading (Z-score -0.67), with less reading correlating with higher perceived stress. While some of these behaviors show minor correlations with perceived stress, their influence appears less pronounced compared to the profound psychological and physiological indicators.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents with compelling and multifaceted evidence suggesting a perceived stress level in the top 50% of the study population. Psychologically, there is pronounced trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 2.05) and elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.9), both strongly correlating with higher PSS. This is compounded by significantly lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.15) and happiness (Z-score -1.61), which are negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a substantial deficit in emotional well-being that is associated with increased stress.

Physiologically and behaviorally, the data points to significant stress. Sleep patterns are severely disturbed, characterized by subjectively poor sleep quality (PSQI score 7.0) and, critically, extremely high variability in sleep start time (Z-score 2.89) and above-average sleep duration variability (Z-score 0.32), all positively correlated with PSS. Circadian rhythm integrity is compromised, demonstrated by markedly low interdaily stability (Z-score -2.06) and a blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score -2.13), both negatively correlated with PSS, signifying irregular and less robust physiological rhythms. Further, an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.2) and a higher mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.07) suggest chronic physiological arousal. Hourly heart rate data indicates relatively higher heart rates during typical sleep periods compared to the population, also linking to increased stress. Certain behavioral patterns, such as above-average wine/liquor consumption and lack of reading, also align with higher perceived stress based on their correlations.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a low or median PSS score is considerably weaker and less consistent. The participant's engagement in sports and exercise with others is above average and weakly negatively correlated with PSS, which could slightly mitigate stress. Similarly, low engagement in video games and sedentary hobbies, alongside lower intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score -1.09) and a slightly higher 24-hour autocorrelation, show minor negative correlations with PSS. These indicators, however, are few, their Z-scores are not as extreme, and their correlations with PSS are generally less robust or even counter-intuitive (e.g., shorter sleep duration weakly correlating with lower PSS, less exercise alone correlating with lower PSS) compared to the strong indicators of high stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly points towards the participant experiencing a high level of perceived stress. The significant psychological distress, marked by high anxiety, depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and low happiness, is strongly and consistently correlated with higher PSS. This is robustly supported by severe objective and subjective sleep disturbances, including profound sleep schedule irregularity and compromised circadian rhythmicity as indicated by wearable data. The physiological markers of elevated resting heart rate and attenuated heart rate amplitude further reinforce this conclusion. While some activity habits show minor associations with potentially lower stress, these are minor and are substantially outweighed by the numerous, strong, and coherent indicators of elevated stress across psychological, sleep, and physiological domains.

22138,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a nuanced psychological profile. While self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D score 15.0, Z-score 0.18) are within the non-depressed range and near the population mean, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated (score 50.0, Z-score 0.86), classifying them as ""anxious"" relative to the study population. This suggests a chronic predisposition to anxiety. Despite this, self-esteem (score 42.0, Z-Score 0.54) is above average, which typically serves as a protective factor against stress. Self-reported happiness (Current 3.0, Z-Score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Score 3.44, Z-score -0.62) are somewhat below the population mean, potentially indicating areas of mild dissatisfaction. Academic performance is strong and consistent, with GPAs ranging from 3.68 to 3.93 across multiple semesters.

Sleep patterns indicate good subjective quality coupled with some irregularity in timing. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z-Score -0.8) classifies the participant as having ""Good Sleep,"" indicating satisfaction with their sleep experience. Wearable data corroborates aspects of this, showing a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours 32 minutes (Z-Score 0.43) and below-average variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation 82 minutes, Z-Score -0.43). The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-Score -0.86). However, there is notable variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation 121 minutes, Z-Score 0.83), suggesting an inconsistent bedtime routine, which could act as a stressor or reflect fluctuating daily schedules.

The participant’s physiological circadian rhythm, derived from heart rate data, demonstrates robust amplitude and stability but a slightly later timing. Interdaily Stability (Value 0.47, Z-Score 0.5) is above average, indicating a regular and consistent daily heart rate pattern across days. The Amplitude (Value 13.05, Z-Score 0.73) is also elevated, reflecting a substantial difference between peak and trough heart rate levels, which is generally associated with good physiological regulation. However, the Acrophase is observed at 4:20 PM, which is a relatively late peak for daily physiological activity compared to typical patterns, implying a shifted daily rhythm. Intradaily Variability (Value 0.47, Z-Score -0.53) is slightly below average, suggesting relatively stable heart rate levels throughout the day once the rhythm is established. Resting Heart Rate (Value 60.6, Z-Score 0.29) is near the population mean. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal typical diurnal fluctuations, with lowest heart rates occurring between 3-6 AM and peak heart rates observed in the mid-afternoon (1-2 PM, Z-score 1.1) and early evening (6-7 PM, Z-score 0.82). The elevated heart rate deviation between 1-2 PM is particularly notable, suggesting a period of heightened cardiovascular activity during this time compared to peers.

The participant engages in a mix of social and solitary activities. Substance use indicates moderate alcohol consumption, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-Score 0.94), which is above the population average, while beer consumption is less frequent. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise habits are predominantly social; the participant exercises with others three times a week or more (Z-Score 1.23) but reports no participation in sports (Z-Score -1.09) or exercising alone (Z-Score -1.93). Daily recreation habits include above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-Score 1.28) and reading (16-30 minutes, Z-Score 1.3), both of which are common leisure activities. Internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score 0.85) is also above average. Notably, time spent socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score -0.62) and listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-Score -0.72) is below average. This pattern suggests a preference for more passive or solitary forms of recreation, with the exception of social exercise.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a PSS Score in the Bottom 50%:**
The participant demonstrates several psychological and physiological characteristics commonly associated with lower levels of perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score -0.8), indicating satisfaction with sleep. Wearable data supports this with a healthy median sleep duration (Z-score 0.43) and notably low variability in sleep duration (Z-score -0.43), suggesting consistent and stable sleep. Furthermore, the absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) is linked to lower perceived stress. Physiologically, the circadian rhythm exhibits above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.5) and amplitude (Z-score 0.73), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a well-regulated physiological system. Psychologically, self-esteem is above average (Z-score 0.54) and negatively correlated with PSS, acting as a potential buffer against stress. Depressive symptoms are not elevated (CES-D Z-score 0.18, ""Not depressed""). Behavioral patterns include regular social exercise (Z-score 1.23) and substantial time spent reading (Z-score 1.3), activities often associated with stress reduction.

**Evidence for a PSS Score in the Top 50%:**
Conversely, several indicators suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress. The most prominent is the participant's elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 50.0, Z-score 0.86), which classifies them as ""anxious"" and holds a positive correlation (0.31) with PSS scores. This suggests a chronic predisposition to experiencing anxiety and stress. Sleep start times exhibit significant variability (Z-score 0.83), which is positively correlated with PSS and indicates an inconsistent daily routine that can contribute to or reflect stress. Additionally, self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.62) are somewhat below average, which may reflect underlying stress or dissatisfaction. The resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score 0.29) and positively correlated with PSS, potentially indicating slightly higher physiological arousal. The peak in hourly heart rate deviation at 1-2 PM (Z-score 1.1) also suggests a period of heightened cardiovascular activity that is above what is typical for the population at that time, potentially indicative of acute arousal or activity.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits a notable predisposition to anxiety (STAI), the comprehensive data suggests that several robust protective and adaptive mechanisms are likely moderating their overall experience of perceived stress. The strong indicators of good subjective sleep quality, consistent sleep duration, and highly regular circadian rhythms (high interdaily stability and amplitude) typically function as significant buffers against stress. Combined with above-average self-esteem and the absence of depressive symptoms, these factors suggest a resilient profile despite elevated trait anxiety. Although there is variability in sleep start times and periods of heightened daytime physiological arousal, the consistent positive indicators from both self-reported well-being and objective physiological measures strongly imply effective stress management. Therefore, despite the ""anxious"" classification on the STAI, the cumulative evidence points to a perceived stress level that is likely managed well, placing the participant in the lower half of the study population distribution (PSS score <= 22.0).

31439,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates elevated levels of distress and anxiety. Their Trait Anxiety score (STAI = 49.0, Z-score = 0.76) is moderately elevated, placing them significantly above the population mean in terms of chronic anxiety proneness, a trait positively correlated with perceived stress. Similarly, depressive symptom burden (CESD = 16.0, Z-score = 0.28) is slightly above the population average and classified as ""Depressed,"" also showing a positive correlation with stress. Consistent with these findings, the participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.45). Furthermore, a significantly low trust score (Z-score = -1.42) may indicate cautious interpersonal engagement. Counterbalancing these, self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.11), which could serve as a psychological resource. Overall, these self-report measures suggest a predisposition to anxiety and some depressive affect, alongside lower general well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits several patterns relevant to stress and coping. Subjectively, their sleep quality is categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI = 6.0), though their Z-score (-0.33) indicates it is less disturbed than the average for the study population. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a relatively short median sleep duration of 6 hours 41 minutes (Z-score = -0.61), indicating insufficient sleep. Additionally, their sleep duration is moderately variable (Standard Deviation = 110 minutes, Z-score = 0.22), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns, despite a relatively consistent sleep start time (SD = 67 minutes, Z-score = -0.35). In terms of coping and recreational activities, the participant reports above-average weekly consumption of beer (Z-score = 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94). They also engage in more screen time with TV/videos (Z-score = 1.28) and reading (Z-score = 1.3) than the average, possibly as a means of unwinding. Exercise frequency is moderate, and academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently strong.

The participant's wearable-derived physiological data present a compelling picture of heightened sympathetic arousal. Both the Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and the daily average heart rate (Mesor) are significantly elevated, with Z-scores of 2.38 for both, placing them well above the population mean. This indicates a chronically elevated cardiovascular activity level, a robust physiological marker associated with chronic stress. While the participant exhibits good interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.25) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = 0.64) in their heart rate rhythm, suggesting a regular daily cycle, the amplitude of this rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.50). This combination implies a regular but somewhat blunted heart rate variation, where the body struggles to achieve significantly lower heart rates. Further supporting this, the intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.24) is notably low, suggesting less fragmentation or more sustained physiological activity throughout the day. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals that while heart rate generally decreases during nighttime hours and increases during the day, the participant's heart rate in the early morning (e.g., 5-7 AM) is relatively less suppressed compared to the population average for those hours (positive Z-scores for deviation from mesor). This overall physiological profile, characterized by high baseline heart rate and a potentially blunted diurnal variation, is consistent with chronic physiological stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High Perceived Stress (Top 50%)**
Substantial evidence suggests the participant likely experiences elevated levels of perceived stress, placing them in the top half of the study population. Psychologically, their markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.76) and above-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = 0.28) are both positively correlated with higher PSS scores. Congruently, self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53) is below the population mean, which negatively correlates with PSS, further indicating higher stress. Physiologically, the most striking indicators are the significantly elevated Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = 2.38) and Mesor (Z-score = 2.38), both of which are strongly associated with increased perceived stress. Behaviorally, the participant experiences objectively insufficient sleep duration (6h 41m, Z-score = -0.61) and increased variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 0.22), factors commonly linked to higher stress. The classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" by PSQI further supports this, despite a slightly better PSQI Z-score than the population mean. Furthermore, their heart rate rhythm, while regular, exhibits lower intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.24), which, when positively correlated with PSS, can imply a sustained physiological activation that might be difficult to disengage from, contributing to chronic stress. The relative lack of heart rate suppression in the early morning hours, as indicated by positive Z-scores for deviation from Mesor between 5-7 AM, also aligns with a heightened stress response.

**Evidence for Low or Median Perceived Stress (Bottom 50%)**
Conversely, some data points might suggest a relatively lower or average level of perceived stress. The participant's self-esteem (Z-score = 0.11) is slightly above average and negatively correlated with PSS, potentially acting as a psychological buffer against stress. Their objective circadian rhythm exhibits good interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.25) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = 0.64), indicating a regular daily pattern. Both of these metrics are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting that this regularity is typically associated with lower stress levels. Additionally, their sleep start time is relatively consistent (SD Z-score = -0.35). Academic performance, as reflected by a consistently high GPA, also suggests effective coping in at least one domain. While subjective sleep quality is categorized as ""Disturbed,"" the participant's PSQI Z-score (-0.33) is below the population average, implying that their subjective sleep difficulties might be less severe than those experienced by the average study participant.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**
Upon holistic evaluation, the cumulative evidence strongly points towards the participant experiencing a relatively high level of perceived stress. The pronounced psychological burden, characterized by elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with significantly heightened physiological arousal manifested in persistently high resting and average heart rates, forms a robust cluster of indicators for elevated stress. While aspects such as consistent circadian rhythm and self-esteem offer some resilience, they are significantly outweighed by the direct and strongly correlated measures of distress and physiological dysregulation. The objective sleep deficits further exacerbate this picture. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls within the top 50% of the study population distribution.

46558,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a distinctive profile characterized by a blend of elevated psychological well-being markers alongside a notably sedentary lifestyle and some indicators of depressive symptomatology, all underpinned by robust physiological regularity. Self-report data indicate a significantly high level of reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.8). Concurrently, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality as measured by the PSQI (Z-score -0.8) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43). These subjective well-being metrics collectively suggest a generally positive psychological state, potentially contributing to lower perceived stress. However, the participant’s CES-D score (17.0, Z-score 0.38) falls into the ""Depressed"" classification, indicating slightly elevated depressive symptoms compared to the study population, which could potentially contribute to perceived stress, albeit less so than the low anxiety and high happiness might mitigate. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45), a factor that generally correlates negatively with psychological well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly sedentary lifestyle. Exercise levels are notably low across all categories, with Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.58, indicating significantly less physical activity than the population average. This is compounded by extremely high engagement in video games (Z-score 3.23) and other sedentary hobbies (Z-score 2.01). Despite this, daily social interaction and music listening are above average. Substance use is minimal, with very low or no reported use of wine, liquor, or recreational drugs. The participant’s preference for sedentary, screen-based activities suggests a potential coping or leisure strategy that, in this population, is negatively correlated with perceived stress for video games.

Physiological data reveal a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm, a strong indicator of robust biological regulation. The participant demonstrates significantly high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.73), alongside markedly low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.98) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.61). These metrics collectively point to a consistent and predictable daily rhythm in physiological activity, which is generally associated with better health outcomes and lower stress. Median sleep duration is average (7 hours 5 minutes), and the participant rarely naps. While the resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score 0.3), the hourly heart rate deviations show clear nocturnal dipping and pronounced diurnal peaks. Specifically, heart rate deviations are notably higher than the population average during typical active hours (e.g., 2-3 PM with a Z-score of 1.08, and 7-8 PM with a Z-score of 0.91). These elevated diurnal responses, counterintuitively, show negative correlations with perceived stress in the study population, suggesting that the participant’s cardiovascular system exhibits a robust and healthy range of arousal in response to daily demands rather than a blunted or chronically elevated pattern.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess whether the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the cumulative evidence. The population PSS mean is 21.61, with a 50th percentile at 22.0.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

A significant body of evidence supports a lower or average perceived stress level for this participant. Most prominently, self-reported happiness is remarkably high (Z-score 1.64), a factor strongly negatively correlated with PSS. Subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8), is classified as ""Good Sleep"" and suggests a positive contribution to overall well-being and lower stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43), indicating a disposition less prone to chronic worry. From the wearable data, the most compelling evidence lies in the extraordinary regularity and stability of physiological rhythms. High Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.83) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.73), coupled with very low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.98) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.61), strongly suggest robust physiological regulation that is typically inversely related to perceived stress. The patterns of hourly heart rate deviation, particularly the pronounced peaks during active times (e.g., 2-3 PM and 7-8 PM), are associated with lower PSS in the study population, further reinforcing this perspective. The high engagement in video games, while indicating a sedentary lifestyle, also correlates negatively with PSS (-0.14) for this population, suggesting it may serve as an effective stress-reducing activity for this individual.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Conversely, some aspects of the participant's profile suggest potential for elevated perceived stress. The CES-D score of 17.0, classifying the participant as ""Depressed"" and exhibiting a positive Z-score of 0.38, indicates slightly higher depressive symptoms than the population average. Depressive symptoms often co-occur with or contribute to perceived stress. The participant's self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45), which can be a vulnerability factor for stress. The extremely low levels of physical exercise across all categories (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.58) are concerning, as regular physical activity is a known buffer against stress. Additionally, a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.3) could suggest a minor degree of chronic physiological arousal. The slightly higher Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.32) could also suggest some fragmentation in the daily rhythm, which has a positive correlation with PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant exhibits some indicators typically associated with higher stress, such as elevated depressive symptoms and a sedentary lifestyle, the overall pattern of evidence strongly points towards a relatively lower or average level of perceived stress. The strength of the objective physiological markers of regularity and stability, coupled with high self-reported happiness, good subjective sleep quality, and low trait anxiety, collectively outweigh the impact of the depressive symptoms or lack of exercise in the context of *perceived* stress. The robust circadian rhythm and appropriate physiological responses, along with key subjective well-being indicators, suggest that this individual likely possesses effective internal and behavioral resources to manage and perceive stress at a level that is not elevated. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s PSS score would likely fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

93699,13.0,0.023316062176165803,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile indicates a pattern of moderate anxiety and lower-than-average self-esteem and happiness, contributing to a general sense of distress. Specifically, their STAI score (44.0, Z-score 0.27) places them slightly above the population mean for trait anxiety, a psychological disposition positively correlated with perceived stress. While depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, are low (Score 8.0, Z-score -0.55), this does not negate the presence of other forms of psychological strain. Further, the participant reports significantly low satisfaction with their physical health (Score 2.78, Z-score -1.11) and below-average self-esteem (Score 35.0, Z-Score -0.45) and happiness (Score 3.0, Z-Score -0.53), all of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting these factors may contribute to or be symptomatic of elevated stress levels.

Sleep patterns present a significant concern. The participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep quality according to the PSQI (Score 9.0, Z-Score 1.05), indicating substantial subjective sleep difficulties. This self-reported disturbance is further contextualized by wearable data, which shows a slightly below-average median sleep duration of 6 hours 51 minutes (Z-score -0.42) and moderate variability in both sleep duration and sleep start times. While not extreme in terms of duration or variability compared to peers, the combination of subjective poor sleep quality and slightly irregular sleep patterns suggests a sleep architecture that is likely not restorative, a factor strongly associated with increased perceived stress.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits an elevated baseline heart rate. Their resting heart rate (64.8, Z-Score 0.79) and Mesor (79.36, Z-Score 0.74) are both notably higher than the study population mean, indicating a generally higher level of cardiovascular activity and physiological arousal. This elevated baseline is positively correlated with perceived stress. Despite this, the participant demonstrates good regularity in their heart rate-based circadian rhythm, evidenced by above-average Interdaily Stability (0.51, Z-Score 0.83) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.42, Z-Score 0.81), and slightly below-average Intradaily Variability (0.53, Z-Score -0.11). These metrics suggest a consistent, well-entrained daily physiological rhythm, which can be a protective factor. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with a nadir during early morning hours (e.g., -18.54 from Mesor between 5-6 AM) and a peak in the early afternoon (e.g., 16.31 from Mesor between 12-1 PM). However, the overall higher mesor implies that even during periods of lower activity, the heart rate remains elevated compared to the average participant, reflecting a consistent state of heightened physiological arousal.

Lifestyle behaviors further characterize the participant's daily experience. They engage in substantial screen time, with internet usage exceeding four hours daily (Z-Score 2.19) and 1-2 hours watching TV/videos (Z-Score 1.28), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, the participant reports no time spent on reading (Z-Score -0.67), an activity negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting a potential lack of engagement in known stress-buffering activities. Exercise habits are mixed; while they exercise with others 1-2 times a week (Z-Score 0.53), participation in sports is entirely absent (Z-Score -1.09). Substance usage is low across categories, with minimal use of alcohol and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. These behavioral patterns, particularly high screen time and lack of potentially calming activities, combined with low health satisfaction, suggest a lifestyle that may contribute to, or be influenced by, elevated stress levels.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for a higher perceived stress level stems from the participant's significantly disturbed self-reported sleep quality, indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-Score 1.05), which places them well above the population average for sleep disturbance. This is a critical indicator as poor sleep is strongly and bi-directionally linked with stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 44.0, Z-score 0.27), suggesting a predisposition to anxious reactions that can directly contribute to higher perceived stress. Physiologically, an elevated resting heart rate (64.8, Z-score 0.79) and higher overall cardiovascular mesor (79.36, Z-score 0.74) point towards a chronic state of heightened physiological arousal, a common correlate of stress. Psychologically, lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), reduced happiness (Z-score -0.53), and particularly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.11) are all dimensions negatively correlated with perceived stress, indicating a generally diminished sense of well-being. Lifestyle factors such as very high internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and a complete lack of engagement in reading (Z-score -0.67), an activity negatively correlated with PSS, further suggest behaviors that might exacerbate or reflect elevated stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, there is some evidence that might suggest lower or average perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 8.0, Z-score -0.55), indicating that major depressive symptomatology is not a primary driver of their stress. Furthermore, objective wearable data reveals strong interdaily stability (Z-score 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81) in their heart rate rhythms. This indicates a consistent and regular daily physiological rhythm, which is often considered a protective factor against stress and is negatively correlated with PSS in this dataset. Minimal substance use also suggests a lack of maladaptive coping mechanisms sometimes associated with high stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When weighing the evidence, the indicators pointing towards a higher perceived stress level appear more numerous and impactful. The significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI), coupled with elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and objective physiological arousal (higher RHR and Mesor), represents a strong combined signal for elevated stress. While the participant maintains a stable circadian rhythm, suggesting a degree of routine, this regularity does not negate the presence of underlying physiological and psychological strain. The pronounced negative impact on self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, alongside problematic internet usage patterns, reinforces a profile consistent with above-average perceived stress. The low depression score and good circadian stability are notable but are outweighed by the direct and indirect indicators of heightened stress experience. Therefore, the overall assessment suggests the participant is more likely to experience perceived stress at the higher end of the distribution.

84011,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile with notable strengths in physical health and positive affect, alongside some indicators of elevated anxiety and physiological irregularities. Psychologically, the individual reports fewer depressive symptoms than the study population average, as indicated by a CESD score of 6.0 (Z = -0.76), and a higher level of self-reported happiness (Z = 0.55). However, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI-Trait scale, is slightly above average with a score of 44.0 (Z = 0.27), suggesting a somewhat greater proneness to chronic anxiety. Self-esteem is lower than average (Z = -0.73), which is generally associated with increased psychological vulnerability. Despite objective indicators of healthy sleep quantity, the participant subjectively reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI, though their score of 6.0 (Z = -0.33) suggests this disturbance is less pronounced compared to the average among those with disturbed sleep. Academic performance is consistently high, with GPAs ranging from 3.81 to 4.0.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a strong commitment to physical activity, particularly engaging in sports and exercising with others ""three times a week or more,"" corresponding to notably high Z-scores of 1.58 and 1.23, respectively. Substance use is minimal, with ""not at all"" reported for beer, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs (Z-scores from -0.11 to -1.12), indicating a healthy lifestyle in this domain. However, engagement in several recreational activities, such as listening to music (Z = -1.19), reading (Z = -0.67), and socializing with friends (Z = -1.41), is notably lower than the population average. This reduced engagement in specific leisure and social activities could reflect individual preferences or potential areas of reduced social connectedness.

Physiologically, derived from wearable data, the participant displays a remarkably low average heart rate (Mesor = 63.1 bpm, Z = -1.48) and a significantly low resting heart rate (51.4 bpm, Z = -0.8), both of which are indicative of good cardiovascular fitness and a low baseline physiological arousal. However, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm exhibits some noteworthy patterns. Intradaily Variability (IV) is notably high (Z = 1.02), suggesting greater fragmentation or rapid changes in heart rate within the day. Interdaily Stability (IS) is slightly below average (Z = -0.49), indicating less day-to-day regularity in activity patterns, and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also slightly lower (Z = -0.32). The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 3:54 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern of very low heart rates during the early morning sleep hours (e.g., -17.31 bpm below Mesor between 3-4 AM) followed by a pronounced elevation in the evening, peaking between 8-9 PM with a deviation of 22.05 bpm (Z = 2.19). This substantial evening heart rate elevation, followed by a sharp decline between 9-10 PM (Z = -2.18), suggests periods of intense physiological arousal or activity during the evening, potentially followed by a rapid transition to a resting state.

Objective sleep statistics indicate a median sleep duration of 8 hours 28 minutes, which is notably longer than the population average (Z = 1.59). The participant also exhibits average consistency in sleep start times and slightly less variability in sleep duration (Z = -0.38), and reports taking fewer naps (Z = -0.86). This objective data suggests good sleep quantity and reasonable consistency, contrasting somewhat with the self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" from the PSQI, which may reflect subjective perceptions of sleep quality or specific aspects of sleep not captured by duration alone.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant demonstrates several strong indicators typically associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z = -0.76), and happiness levels are above average (Z = 0.55), both of which correlate favorably with lower PSS. A significant protective factor is the participant's high engagement in physical exercise, particularly social exercise and sports (Z-scores of 1.23 and 1.58), activities consistently linked to improved stress resilience. Physiologically, the remarkably low Mesor heart rate (Z = -1.48) and resting heart rate (Z = -0.8) signify excellent cardiovascular fitness and a low baseline physiological arousal, which are generally inversely related to perceived stress. Objectively, sleep data from Fitbit shows notably long sleep durations (median 8 hours 28 minutes, Z = 1.59) and slightly less variability in sleep duration (Z = -0.38), providing a foundation for restorative processes. Additionally, despite a self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, the PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates this disturbance is less severe than the average for individuals reporting such issues, and lower PSQI scores correlate with lower PSS.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, some data points suggest potential vulnerabilities to higher perceived stress. The participant's STAI-Trait score of 44.0 (Z = 0.27) indicates slightly elevated chronic anxiety, which is positively correlated with PSS. Lower self-esteem (Z = -0.73) is another factor associated with increased PSS. In terms of behavior, reduced engagement in certain recreational activities, especially socializing with friends (Z = -1.41) and reading (Z = -0.67), might remove potential coping mechanisms or social support, with lower reading correlating with higher PSS. Physiologically, aspects of the circadian rhythm suggest dysregulation, specifically a notably high Intradaily Variability (Z = 1.02), indicating fragmented heart rate patterns within the day, which is positively correlated with PSS. Slightly lower Interdaily Stability (Z = -0.49) and amplitude (Z = -0.32) are also correlated with higher PSS. The pronounced and rapid increase in heart rate during the evening (8-9 PM, Z = 2.19) followed by a sharp drop suggests significant physiological arousal during this period, potentially linked to high activity or stress, and a less smooth transition towards rest.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits a blend of positive and negative indicators related to stress, the overall evidence leans towards a perceived stress level in the bottom half of the study population. The robust physiological indicators of low heart rate (Mesor and RHR), combined with a high level of physical activity and objectively long sleep duration, represent powerful stress-buffering mechanisms. Furthermore, lower depressive symptoms and higher happiness scores suggest a generally positive psychological state that would likely mitigate the subjective experience of stress. Although elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, and some circadian irregularities are present, their magnitude (with the exception of Intradaily Variability) is generally less extreme than the strongly positive indicators. The dramatic evening heart rate changes, while notable, could be attributable to intense physical activity given the high exercise engagement rather than solely psychological distress. Therefore, the cumulative strength of the protective factors, particularly in physiological health and active coping, suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress is more likely to be in the lower range.

88008,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant presents with a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by significant self-reported psychological distress alongside robust physical activity and well-structured physiological rhythms. Self-report data indicate above-average depressive symptoms (CESD score of 20.0, Z-score 0.7, classified as ""Depressed"") and trait anxiety (STAI score of 48.0, Z-score 0.66, classified as ""anxious""). Both CESD and STAI scores show positive correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale (0.28 and 0.31, respectively), suggesting these elevated symptoms are likely associated with higher perceived stress. Further contributing to this psychological burden are lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.73), happiness (Z-score -0.53), and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7), all of which are negatively correlated with PSS, implying a potential link to increased perceived stress. The participant also reports below-average trust in others (Z-score -0.78). Academically, while current GPA (3.65) is strong, past fluctuations suggest periods of varying performance.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a lifestyle largely free from substance use, reporting no engagement with beer, wine/liquor, recreational, or non-prescribed drugs (all Z-scores significantly negative). This abstinence is generally associated with positive health outcomes. The participant demonstrates a high commitment to physical activity, exercising alone and participating in sports ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58, respectively), and exercising with others ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.53). This level of activity is known to be a protective factor against stress, and sports participation, in particular, shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.12). Recreational habits include above-average engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64), playing video games (Z-score 0.96), and reading (Z-score 1.3), with both video games (-0.14) and reading (-0.21) showing negative correlations with PSS, potentially indicating these serve as effective relaxation or coping mechanisms for this individual. Internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends are reported at average levels.

Despite self-reporting ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8), objective Fitbit data reveal a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 9 minutes (Z-score -1.29). The participant exhibits a very late median sleep start time of 01:13:59. However, both sleep duration (standard deviation 68 minutes, Z-score -0.75) and sleep start time (standard deviation 77 minutes, Z-score -0.13) show relative consistency, suggesting a regular, albeit constrained and delayed, sleep schedule. Napping behavior is minimal (mean daily naps Z-score 0.12). The discrepancy between subjective ""good sleep"" and objectively short duration suggests either adaptation to less sleep or a lack of awareness regarding the impact of short sleep on overall well-being.

Physiologically, the participant displays a robust and highly structured circadian rhythm as evidenced by wearable heart rate data. Metrics such as high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.91), very low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.73), high Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 0.73), and a pronounced Amplitude (Z-score 1.48) all indicate a clear and regular daily pattern of physiological activity and rest. The average heart rate (Mesor) is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.61), while the resting heart rate (55.1 bpm, Z-score -0.36) is slightly below the population average, generally a positive health indicator. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal significant drops during the early morning hours, reaching a nadir of -26.06 bpm between 4-5 AM (Z-score -1.32), consistent with a deep resting phase. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs at 5:06 PM, with the highest physiological arousal observed later in the evening, peaking between 7-9 PM (e.g., 19.47 bpm at 7-8 PM, Z-score 1.39; 17.8 bpm at 8-9 PM, Z-score 1.44). This pattern extends into the late evening (10.53 bpm at 11-12 AM, Z-score 1.06), suggesting an individual with high evening activity levels that likely contribute to the late sleep onset.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated perceived stress level stems from the participant's self-reported psychological measures. The participant is classified as ""Depressed"" (CESD score 20.0, Z-score 0.7) and ""anxious"" (STAI score 48.0, Z-score 0.66). Both these instruments measure constructs highly related to perceived stress, and their scores are positively correlated with PSS (0.28 for CESD, 0.31 for STAI). Being significantly above the mean on these measures strongly suggests an elevated level of internal distress. Furthermore, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.73), happiness (Z-score -0.53), and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7). These factors are negatively correlated with PSS (ranging from -0.08 to -0.19), indicating that lower levels in these areas tend to be associated with higher perceived stress. Objectively, the median sleep duration is significantly short at 6 hours 9 minutes (Z-score -1.29), which is a common physiological stressor, despite the participant's subjective assessment of good sleep.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, there are several indicators that might suggest a lower or average PSS score. The participant subjectively reports ""Good Sleep"" as per the PSQI (score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), implying they do not consciously experience their sleep as poor, which could mitigate perceived stress related to sleep. Behaviorally, the participant abstains from all reported substance use, a lifestyle choice generally associated with reduced health risks and stress. A high engagement in physical activity, including sports and exercising alone frequently (Z-scores 1.58 and 1.07, respectively), is a strong protective factor against stress; notably, sports participation is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12). High engagement in recreational activities such as reading (Z-score 1.3, correlation -0.21) and video games (Z-score 0.96, correlation -0.14) also suggests effective non-strenuous coping or relaxation strategies. Physiologically, the wearable data indicates highly robust circadian rhythms, characterized by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.91), low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.73), high Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 0.73), and a high Amplitude (Z-score 1.48). These features signify a well-regulated daily physiological rhythm, which is generally associated with better health and stress resilience. The participant also maintains a relatively consistent sleep schedule, despite its lateness and shortness (low standard deviations for sleep duration and start time). The resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.36), which is a positive indicator for cardiovascular health. The high GPA in the most recent semester (3.65) might also suggest effective academic coping.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits several robust behavioral and physiological protective factors against stress, particularly high physical activity and highly structured circadian rhythms, these appear to be insufficient to fully mitigate the significant psychological distress indicated by the self-report measures. The elevated scores on the CESD and STAI, which classify the participant as ""Depressed"" and ""anxious,"" are strong, direct indicators of an internal state of psychological burden. These measures also show the strongest positive correlations with PSS scores among the available data, suggesting they are highly relevant predictors of perceived stress. The consistently short objective sleep duration, despite subjective satisfaction, could also contribute to underlying stress. Given the prominence and magnitude of these self-reported psychological symptoms, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level is elevated relative to the general student population.

83566,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a pronounced pattern of elevated psychological distress and physiological arousal, accompanied by specific behavioral patterns. Psychologically, there is a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, indicated by a CESD score of 37.0 (Z-score 2.47), classifying them as 'Depressed' and significantly above the population mean. Concurrently, trait anxiety is notably high, with a STAI score of 62.0 (Z-score 2.05), classifying the participant as 'anxious'. Both of these psychological symptom measures show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress. Complementing this, self-reported happiness (Current 2.0, Z-score -1.61) is markedly lower than peers, and self-esteem (Score 29.0, Z-score -1.29) is below average, with both negatively correlating with perceived stress. Despite these challenges, the participant maintains strong academic performance, as evidenced by consistent GPAs (3.5-3.67). Health satisfaction is slightly below average but not notably so.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant self-reports 'Disturbed Sleep' via the PSQI (Score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), indicating subjective difficulties. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 8 minutes, which is significantly longer than the study population (Z-score 1.18). Sleep duration is also more consistent than peers, with a below-average standard deviation (Z-score -0.82). The median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:52:00, though the variability in sleep onset is average. The participant does not report napping, which is less frequent than the population average. While the longer and more consistent sleep durations might appear beneficial, the reported subjective disturbance from the PSQI, coupled with physiological arousal markers, suggests that sleep quantity may not translate to restorative quality or may be a compensatory response.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates clear indicators of elevated sympathetic nervous system activity. The Mesor, representing the mean heart rate across the recording period (84.83 bpm, Z-score 1.49), is significantly elevated, suggesting a higher physiological baseline. Similarly, the resting heart rate (RHR: 69.4 bpm, Z-score 1.34) is above average and shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. While the daily amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is within an average range, the overall elevated baseline indicates persistent arousal. Circadian rhythm metrics suggest generally stable patterns in physiological activity, with Interdaily Stability at an average level (Z-score 0.09) and above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.90), indicating regularity across days. However, Intradaily Variability is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.24), which could point to some fragmentation in daily activity patterns and is weakly positively correlated with perceived stress. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate typical diurnal fluctuations (lower during sleep, higher during wakefulness); however, during the early morning hours (approximately 3 AM to 7 AM), the heart rate reduction from the Mesor is less pronounced compared to peers (less negative Z-scores), and these less pronounced dips correlate positively with higher perceived stress, implying incomplete physiological recovery even during sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a lifestyle characterized by low engagement in several common activities. There is no reported substance use across all categories. Participation in exercise is notably low, particularly for exercising with others (Z-score -1.58) and engaging in sports (Z-score -1.09), with lower sports participation showing a weak negative correlation with perceived stress. Furthermore, engagement in many recreational habits, such as watching TV/videos, video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies, is minimal or absent, with negative Z-scores suggesting less participation than peers. Socializing with friends is also reported below average. The lack of engagement in potentially stress-buffering activities, such as physical exercise and leisure reading (which has a weak-moderate negative correlation with PSS when lower), may either reflect or contribute to the participant's overall elevated psychological distress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50%):
The most compelling indicators come from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 2.05), both classified as high and showing moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31, respectively). Consistently, happiness is markedly low (Z-score -1.61) and self-esteem is below average (Z-score -1.29), with both negatively correlating with PSS, further supporting a state of heightened psychological distress linked to higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59). Physiologically, the participant displays an elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.49) and resting heart rate (RHR Z-score 1.34), with RHR showing a weak positive correlation with PSS. Furthermore, the less pronounced heart rate drops during early morning sleep, which correlate positively with PSS, suggest incomplete physiological recovery. Behavioral patterns, such as very low engagement in exercise (especially social exercise and sports) and reading, also align with a profile of higher perceived stress, particularly the moderate negative correlation of lower reading with higher PSS. The slightly elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.24) and its weak positive correlation with PSS also contribute to this assessment.

Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):
Some objective sleep metrics might initially suggest a lower stress profile, such as a longer median sleep duration (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-score 1.18) and more consistent sleep durations (Z-score -0.82), with the latter correlating negatively with higher PSS. The lack of napping (Z-score -0.86) is also associated with lower PSS. Furthermore, a relatively stable 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.90) in heart rate, which correlates negatively with PSS, indicates good circadian regularity, often associated with lower stress. The negligible use of substances is generally a positive health indicator. However, these factors are insufficient to outweigh the substantial evidence pointing towards elevated stress.

Holistic conclusion:
While the participant demonstrates some positive objective sleep and circadian regularity features, the profound and consistent indicators of psychological distress (high CESD, STAI, low happiness, low self-esteem), disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI), and physiological markers of chronic arousal (high Mesor, RHR, impaired nocturnal recovery) are highly salient. These factors, particularly those with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS, collectively paint a clear picture of an individual experiencing elevated perceived stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls into the top 50% of the study population distribution.

87032,26.0,0.927461139896373,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress, profound sleep disturbances, marked physiological dysregulation, and a sedentary lifestyle, all of which are strongly associated with elevated perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a notable burden of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 28.0 (Z-score 1.53), classified as 'Depressed' and positively correlated with PSS. This is accompanied by an above-average level of trait anxiety (STAI score 44.0, Z-score 0.27), also positively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, the participant reports below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.31), reduced happiness (Z-score -0.53), and lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.53), all of which correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting their contribution to increased stress. While the participant maintains a consistent and high GPA, indicating academic competence, this factor alone does not mitigate the other pervasive indicators of psychological strain.

Sleep patterns, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, are significantly disturbed. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) unequivocally indicates clinically significant poor subjective sleep quality. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 43 minutes (Z-score -0.58), which is below average. More strikingly, the participant demonstrates a late median sleep start time of 02:00:29 and considerable irregularity in sleep timing, with a sleep start time standard deviation of 145 minutes (Z-score 1.36). Both shorter and more variable sleep durations, along with highly irregular sleep schedules, are positively correlated with PSS. The participant also reports higher than average daily napping (Z-score 1.27), which often signals insufficient or poor-quality nighttime sleep.

Physiological data from the wearable device provides compelling evidence of chronic physiological arousal and circadian rhythm disruption. The participant's resting heart rate (69.4 bpm, Z-score 1.34) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 85.35 bpm, Z-score 1.56) are significantly elevated compared to the study population, both positively correlated with PSS. These sustained higher heart rate metrics suggest an elevated baseline of physiological activation. Circadian rhythmicity is notably impaired, with very low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.15) and high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.44), indicating irregular and fragmented heart rate patterns day-to-day and within a single day. The extremely low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.87) further confirms a profound lack of regularity in the participant's daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late at 4:28 PM. An examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals an unusually high heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 6-7 AM deviation of -0.95, Z-score 2.23), suggesting early morning physiological arousal or restlessness that is atypical for the population.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle patterns suggest a lack of active coping mechanisms and engagement in health-promoting activities. Exercise frequency is extremely low across all categories, with Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93, indicating almost no physical activity, a factor generally associated with higher stress. While substance usage is reported as low, with negative Z-scores across all categories, the correlations with PSS are negligible, limiting its interpretive value in mitigating stress. Conversely, the participant reports high engagement in solitary, often sedentary, recreational activities, including watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.91), internet usage (Z-score 2.19), listening to music (Z-score 2.06), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41). Reading is also high (Z-score 2.28) and notably shows a negative correlation with PSS, suggesting this specific activity may serve as a positive coping mechanism or be associated with lower stress. However, the overall pattern of high sedentary activity combined with a near absence of physical exercise points towards a lifestyle that may contribute to or reflect elevated stress levels.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on the comprehensive multimodal analysis, the participant's overall perceived stress level is strongly indicated to be in the top half of the study population distribution (top 50th percentile).

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The evidence overwhelmingly points to a high PSS score. The participant presents with significant self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD classified as 'Depressed') and trait anxiety, both of which correlate positively with PSS. Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI indicating 'Disturbed Sleep'), a critical stressor. Objective wearable data corroborates severe sleep dysregulation, characterized by below-average duration, a very late and highly variable sleep schedule, and frequent napping. Physiologically, the participant exhibits clear signs of chronic stress, including an elevated resting heart rate and mean heart rate (Mesor), alongside profound disruptions in circadian rhythms as indicated by low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, and minimal 24-hour autocorrelation. The pattern of hourly heart rate also suggests atypical early morning arousal. Behaviorally, a complete lack of physical exercise, a known buffer against stress, is observed, coupled with a preference for highly sedentary recreational activities. All these factors, especially those with strong positive correlations with PSS or large Z-scores, consistently align with an elevated experience of perceived stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score is notably scarce and outweighed by the indicators of high stress. The participant maintains a high GPA, which could be a source of academic satisfaction, but its direct correlation with PSS is not provided. Low substance usage is observed, but its correlations with PSS are negligible, thus not strongly indicative of lower stress. The high engagement in reading, with a negative correlation to PSS, is the only clear behavioral indicator that might slightly mitigate perceived stress, but this single factor is insufficient to counteract the multitude of strong indicators suggesting high stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the pervasive and substantial evidence from multiple domains—psychological symptoms, sleep quality and patterns, physiological arousal, circadian rhythm disruption, and sedentary lifestyle—the participant's profile is highly consistent with an elevated level of perceived stress. The magnitude and consistency of these indicators strongly suggest that the participant's PSS score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and physiological profile characterized by elevated indicators of psychological distress, disturbed sleep, and a sedentary lifestyle, coexisting with strong academic performance. Self-report measures indicate a significant burden of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: 1.63) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.25), both of which are notably above the study population mean and positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports below-average self-esteem (Z-score: -0.87) and significantly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: -1.61). Despite these challenges, self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.55), which negatively correlates with perceived stress, suggesting a potential coping mechanism or an incongruence in self-perception across different emotional domains. Social trust is below average (Z-score: -0.78).

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly sedentary lifestyle. Engagement in all forms of exercise (exercising alone, with others, or sports) is reported as ""Not at all,"" with significantly low Z-scores (ranging from -1.09 to -1.93), which is below the population mean. Substance use, including alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, is reported as ""Not at all,"" indicating abstinence. Daily recreational habits reveal a marked preference for sedentary activities: ""Video Games"" are engaged in for ""1-2 hours"" daily, corresponding to a very high Z-score of 2.47, and ""Listening to Music"" for ""more than 4 hours"" (Z-score: 2.06). Furthermore, the participant dedicates ""more than 4 hours"" to a ""Sedentary Hobby"" (Z-score: 3.19), which is exceptionally high. Conversely, ""Socializing with Friends"" is minimal (""15 minutes or less,"" Z-score: -2.20), and reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score: -0.67). Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with GPAs consistently above 3.69, suggesting effective academic coping strategies despite underlying psychological distress.

Sleep patterns are significantly disrupted according to both self-report and wearable data. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52) indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, a finding supported by objective wearable metrics. The participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours 15 minutes (Z-score: -1.15), which is considerably shorter than the population average. Compounding this, sleep duration exhibits high variability (Standard Deviation of 168 minutes, Z-score: 1.52), negatively impacting sleep regularity. Napping is also significantly more frequent than peers (Mean Daily Naps: 0.3, Z-score: 2.66), possibly indicating attempts to compensate for insufficient or disturbed nocturnal sleep. The median sleep start time is late (00:29:59), though its variability is close to the population mean (Z-score: 0.14).

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates elevated chronic arousal. The resting heart rate (RHR) of 70.3 bpm is notably elevated (Z-score: 1.44), as is the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) of 83.09 bpm (Z-score: 1.25). Both elevated RHR and Mesor positively correlate with perceived stress. While the circadian rhythmicity of heart rate maintains a strong 24-hour cycle (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 1.15), its amplitude (9.34, Z-score: -0.47) is slightly below average, suggesting less pronounced variation between peak and trough heart rate values. Intradaily variability is also slightly below average (Z-score: -0.53). Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest values during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -18.3 at 5-6 AM, implying an absolute heart rate of approximately 64.79 bpm) and highest values during the mid-day and late afternoon/early evening (e.g., +11.05 at 2-3 PM, implying an absolute heart rate of approximately 94.14 bpm, and +10.1 at 5-6 PM). These patterns occur against a background of generally elevated baseline heart rate. The acrophase, or peak activity period, is observed at 4:49 PM.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50th percentile):**
Several self-reported psychological measures strongly suggest that the participant likely experiences elevated levels of perceived stress. The participant scores high on depressive symptoms (CESD: Z=1.63, classified as ""Depressed"") and trait anxiety (STAI: Z=1.25, classified as ""anxious""). Both of these measures have positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31, respectively), indicating that higher scores on these scales are associated with higher perceived stress. Additionally, the participant reports significantly disturbed sleep (PSQI: Z=1.52, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""), which is a common correlate of heightened stress. Furthermore, physical health satisfaction is markedly low (Z=-1.61), which, while having a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.07), contributes to an overall picture of distress.

Wearable data further supports the likelihood of high perceived stress. The participant exhibits significantly elevated resting heart rate (RHR: Z=1.44) and a higher overall average heart rate (Mesor: Z=1.25), both of which show positive correlations with PSS (0.14 and 0.06, respectively), pointing towards chronic physiological arousal. Sleep duration is shorter than average (Z=-1.15) and highly variable (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation: Z=1.52, correlation with PSS: 0.14), with frequent napping (Mean Daily Naps: Z=2.66, correlation with PSS: 0.13), all of which are common indicators of stress-related sleep disturbance. A notably low level of socializing (Z=-2.20) with a weak positive correlation to PSS (0.06) could also reflect stress-induced withdrawal or lack of social support.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a lower or median PSS score is comparatively less substantial. The participant reports slightly above-average happiness (Z=0.55), and happiness has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.19), implying that higher happiness is associated with lower stress. High academic performance (GPA consistently high) might reflect effective stress management in this domain or a compartmentalized ability to perform. Physiologically, the 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate is high (Z=1.15) and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.17), indicating a relatively stable and strong daily physiological rhythm, which can be a protective factor against stress. High engagement in video games (Z=2.47), which is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.14), could be interpreted as a coping mechanism that helps reduce perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits some factors that might mitigate perceived stress, such as slightly higher happiness, strong academic performance, and a stable circadian rhythm, these are significantly outweighed by the numerous and potent indicators of psychological distress and physiological arousal. The substantial elevation in self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, severe sleep disturbance (both subjective and objective), consistently elevated heart rate metrics, and a highly sedentary lifestyle with minimal social engagement collectively point towards a profile highly consistent with elevated perceived stress. The Z-scores for CESD, STAI, PSQI, RHR, Mesor, and sleep variability are all considerably above the population mean, and most of these factors correlate positively with PSS scores. Therefore, based on the multimodal data, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

82728,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile marked by high academic achievement and robust physiological rhythms, alongside indicators of disturbed sleep, lower subjective well-being, and significant physiological arousal. Self-report measures reveal a low burden of depressive symptoms (CESD score 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI score 39.0, Z-score -0.23), classifying the participant as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" relative to the study population. Academic performance is consistently excellent, as evidenced by a 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters. However, other self-report measures suggest areas of potential concern: self-esteem (score 37.0, Z-Score -0.17), happiness (current 3.0, Z-Score -0.53), and health satisfaction (score 3.67, Z-score -0.45) are all reported slightly below or notably below the population average. This pattern suggests a potential undercurrent of dissatisfaction or reduced well-being despite low overt symptomology for anxiety and depression.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical activity, exercising alone ""three times a week or more"" (Z-Score 1.07) and with others ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-Score 0.53), while reporting no participation in sports and complete abstinence from all reported substance use categories. This pattern reflects a disciplined approach to health and a lack of engagement in recreational drug or alcohol use. In contrast to high exercise, engagement in most other recreational activities is notably low. The participant spends ""15 minutes or less"" on TV/videos/movies and listening to music (Z-Scores -0.62 and -0.72 respectively), and reports ""do not do"" for video games or reading. Internet usage and socializing with friends are also reported at significantly lower frequencies than the population average (e.g., Internet usage ""16-30 minutes,"" Z-Score -1.16). This suggests a highly focused lifestyle with limited time allocated to common leisure or social pursuits, which could potentially impact stress buffering capacity.

Sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), indicating subjective difficulties. Objectively, median sleep duration (6 hours 59 minutes, Z-Score -0.25) is only slightly below average and relatively stable (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score -0.21). The participant's median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:05:30, with a slightly above-average variability in sleep start times (93 minutes, Z-Score 0.21). Wearable data, however, reveal a highly robust and regular heart rate-based circadian rhythm, evidenced by significantly above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-Score 0.75), below-average Intradaily Variability (Z-Score -0.53), significantly high Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-Score 1.06), and a very strong Amplitude (Z-Score 1.54). This indicates a predictable and strong physiological rhythm, with a MESOR heart rate of 76.53 bpm (Z-Score 0.35) and an acrophase (peak physiological activity) occurring at 4:54 PM.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further elucidates the participant’s physiological arousal patterns. Resting heart rate is slightly above the population average (60.2 bpm, Z-Score 0.24). A clear diurnal rhythm is apparent, with heart rates significantly dropping during typical sleep hours (e.g., -24.17 bpm deviation at 6-7 AM, Z-Score -0.95), reflecting periods of rest. A particularly salient finding is a pronounced peak in physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon/early evening. Specifically, the mean heart rate deviation from the mesor between 5-6 PM reaches 27.42 bpm, corresponding to a Z-Score of 2.47. This represents a remarkably high level of cardiovascular activity relative to both the participant's typical rhythm and the broader study population, suggesting a period of intense activity or significant physiological activation during this time.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a low or median perceived stress score (bottom 50th percentile) for this participant includes their consistently high academic performance (4.0 GPA) and low self-reported symptoms of depression (CESD Z-score -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23). These psychological factors, particularly the low anxiety and depressive symptomology with positive correlations to PSS, suggest a lower-than-average PSS score. Furthermore, the participant's high engagement in physical exercise and robust, stable circadian rhythms (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability, high Autocorrelation, and strong Amplitude) suggest physiological resilience and healthy behavioral regulation, which could serve as protective factors against stress. The participant also completely abstains from substance use, removing a potential source of stress or poor coping.

Conversely, several key indicators suggest that the participant's perceived stress level might be in the top 50th percentile of the study population. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), which typically correlates positively with stress. Additionally, lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), health satisfaction (Z-score -0.45), and self-esteem (Z-score -0.17) would, based on their correlations, contribute to a higher PSS score or indicate associated challenges. Critically, the physiological data reveal a highly significant peak in cardiovascular arousal in the late afternoon/early evening (mean heart rate deviation Z-Score 2.47 at 5-6 PM), indicating a substantial and sustained period of physiological activation well above the population average. This pronounced physiological response, coupled with a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.24) and slightly increased variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.21), points to a body that may be under considerable strain. Additionally, the participant's markedly low engagement in various recreational activities and socializing suggests a potential lack of diverse stress-buffering outlets, which could exacerbate perceived stress.

Based on a holistic analysis, while the participant demonstrates strong academic coping and low overt anxiety/depression symptoms, the convergence of disturbed subjective sleep, lower happiness and health satisfaction, and particularly the extreme physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon/early evening, provides compelling evidence for an elevated level of perceived stress. The pronounced physiological activation, alongside a restricted repertoire of leisure activities, suggests that despite certain protective factors, the participant is experiencing significant internal and physiological strain. Therefore, it is likely that this participant's PSS score falls into the top 50% of the study population.

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile. Self-report measures indicate a mixed emotional state, with slightly above-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.18) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.27). While these scores suggest a predisposition to experience psychological distress, they do not indicate clinically severe levels. Notably, the participant demonstrates remarkably high self-esteem (RSES Z=1.38), which serves as a significant psychological resource and is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, subjective happiness (Z=-0.53) and health satisfaction (Z=-0.95) are reported as below the population average, suggesting areas of discontent. Academic performance, evidenced by consistently strong GPAs (ranging from 3.52 to 3.72), appears unaffected by these psychological nuances.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a highly active lifestyle. Engagement in exercise, both alone (Z=1.07) and with others (Z=1.23), as well as sports (Z=1.58), is reported three times a week or more, placing these activities significantly above the population mean. This consistent high level of physical activity, particularly sports, is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Recreational habits are somewhat selective, with significant time spent watching TV/videos (Z=1.28) and socializing (Z=0.16), while internet usage (Z=-1.83), reading (Z=-0.67), and listening to music (Z=-1.19) are notably low. Substance use is moderate, with wine or liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z=0.94), but no reported use of other substances.

Regarding sleep and circadian rhythms, objective Fitbit data indicates favorable patterns. The participant's median sleep duration of 7 hours 38 minutes (Z=0.56) is above average, and the variability in sleep start times (Z=-0.44) is below average, reflecting relatively consistent sleep hygiene. Despite these objective strengths, the participant subjectively reports disturbed sleep via the PSQI, though their score (Z=-0.33) is actually slightly below the population average for sleep disturbance, and its correlation with PSS is negligible. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals some day-to-day irregularity in heart rate rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z=-0.74), which weakly correlates with higher stress. However, a strong 24-hour rhythmicity is indicated by an above-average autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z=0.81), which negatively correlates with PSS, suggesting a well-entrained daily physiological pattern.

Physiological arousal patterns, as derived from aggregated hourly heart rate data, show a healthy resting heart rate (Z=-0.04) close to the population mean. While nocturnal heart rates exhibit appropriate reductions, the participant demonstrates distinct and pronounced peaks in physiological activity during the late afternoon and early evening. Specifically, heart rate deviation from the mesor is significantly elevated between 3-4 PM (Z=1.48) and reaches an exceptionally high level between 4-5 PM (Z=2.4), coinciding with the acrophase (peak activity) at 4:14 PM. Another notable elevation occurs between 8-9 PM (Z=0.99). These pronounced peaks suggest periods of intense activity or physiological activation, which could be attributed to academic demands, athletic engagement, or other daily demands characteristic of a university student, even if their direct correlation with the PSS score for the general population is not strong.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's perceived stress level (PSS score) likely falls in the top or bottom half of the study population, both evidence for lower/median stress and higher stress must be evaluated.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress score is the participant's significantly high self-esteem (Z-score 1.38), which is a robust psychological protective factor and negatively correlated with PSS. This is strongly supported by a very active lifestyle, including frequent participation in sports (Z-score 1.58) and exercise, a known stress-reducing behavior that is also negatively correlated with PSS. Objectively, sleep duration is above average, and sleep routines are relatively consistent, indicating good sleep hygiene despite subjective reports of disturbance. Furthermore, a strong 24-hour autocorrelation in heart rate (Z-score 0.81), which negatively correlates with PSS, suggests a stable daily physiological rhythm. Consistent high academic performance (GPA > 3.5) also implies effective coping with academic pressures, a common stressor for university students.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, some indicators suggest potential for elevated perceived stress. The participant reports slightly above-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.18) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.27), both of which positively correlate with PSS. Additionally, self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95) are below the population average, implying some dissatisfaction that could be linked to stress. Physiological measures show slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.74) and slightly higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.32) in heart rate, both of which weakly correlate with higher PSS, suggesting some irregularity and fragmentation in daily physiological rhythms. The pronounced peaks in hourly heart rate in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM, Z-score 2.4) indicate periods of high physiological arousal, which, while not directly strongly correlated with PSS, could reflect demanding daily experiences.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant presents a profile with significant strengths that likely mitigate the impact of potential stressors. The remarkably high self-esteem and very active, exercise-rich lifestyle are powerful protective factors against perceived stress. These strong positive attributes, coupled with objectively good sleep quantity and regularity, and excellent academic performance, suggest effective coping and resilience. While the participant experiences some subjective distress (lower happiness/health satisfaction, slightly elevated anxiety/depressive symptoms) and exhibits periods of high physiological arousal, these are likely buffered by their robust psychological resources and healthy behaviors. The positive correlations for PSS with factors like anxiety and depressive symptoms are present, but their Z-scores are only slightly above average, while the protective factors like self-esteem and exercise are much more significantly above average in a favorable direction, with meaningful correlations to PSS. Therefore, it is probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level is relatively well-managed and would fall within the lower to average range compared to their peers.

44872,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by robust psychological well-being and strong physiological resilience, albeit with notable objective irregularities in sleep and circadian rhythmicity. Self-report data indicate significantly above-average levels of happiness (Z-score 1.64) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3), alongside below-average scores for depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23) relative to the study population. These psychological markers, which consistently correlate inversely with perceived stress, suggest a strong internal capacity for coping and a generally positive affective state. The participant also maintains a high and consistent GPA, suggesting academic competence and potentially reduced academic burden. Lifestyle analysis reveals a high frequency of both solitary and social exercise, which can be a protective factor against stress. However, there is also elevated self-reported alcohol consumption, particularly for beer and wine/liquor, which are factors to note, although their correlations with perceived stress are minimal in this dataset. Engagement in passive recreational activities like TV/videos, video games, and internet usage is notably low, while socializing with friends is above average.

Objective sleep and circadian rhythm metrics from wearable data introduce a contrasting dimension to the participant's profile. While the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies sleep as ""disturbed,"" its Z-score of -0.33 indicates that the participant's subjective sleep quality is actually better than the average for the study population. However, objective Fitbit data reveals significant variability in sleep patterns, with above-average standard deviations for both total sleep duration (Z-score 0.77) and, most notably, sleep start time (Z-score 1.55). These inconsistencies in sleep timing and duration correlate positively with perceived stress in the population. Furthermore, circadian rhythm features indicate less regularity in activity-rest cycles, as evidenced by lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.99) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.37), alongside higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.46). These metrics consistently correlate with higher perceived stress, suggesting that despite good subjective sleep quality relative to peers, the objective irregularity of the participant's biological rhythms may be a source of physiological strain. Nevertheless, fundamental cardiovascular health indicators, such as the Mean of Sleep-Onset to Endpoint of Sleep Rate (Mesor, Z-score -1.65) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -1.17), are significantly below the population average, indicating robust physiological conditioning. The amplitude of the circadian heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score -0.13), which can sometimes reflect a blunted physiological response, correlating negatively with PSS.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a highly structured and appropriate daily physiological arousal pattern. The participant demonstrates prominent and sustained peaks in heart rate during mid-morning (e.g., 10-11 AM, Z-score 3.08; 12-1 PM, Z-score 3.23) and late afternoon (e.g., 5-6 PM, Z-score 3.2), indicative of periods of significant physiological activity. These elevated heart rates during daytime activity are largely associated with lower perceived stress, according to the provided correlations. Conversely, deep troughs in heart rate deviation are observed during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 8-9 PM, Z-score -2.18; 12-1 AM, Z-score -1.66), reflecting a substantial reduction in physiological arousal consistent with rest and sleep preparation. The correlations for these low heart rate periods are also predominantly associated with lower perceived stress. This overall pattern suggests a well-modulated autonomic nervous system response that is adaptive to daily demands and conducive to recovery, with the observed physiological rhythmicity generally indicating lower perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Lower or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

The participant exhibits several strong indicators that are consistently associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported psychological well-being is exceptionally high, with significantly elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64) and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.3), coupled with notably low scores for depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23). These direct measures of psychological state are primary determinants of perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular health, reflected in a remarkably low Mesor (Z-score -1.65) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -1.17), both of which are strongly indicative of physiological resilience and correlate with lower PSS. The structured and adaptive daily pattern of heart rate arousal, with robust daytime peaks and distinct nocturnal troughs, also aligns with a profile of lower perceived stress, as indicated by the correlations between these hourly heart rate deviations and PSS. Furthermore, while the self-reported PSQI score classifies sleep as ""disturbed,"" its Z-score of -0.33 suggests that the participant's subjective sleep quality is better than the population average, implying a relatively lower stress burden in this domain compared to peers.

**Evidence for Higher PSS Score (Top 50%):**

Conversely, several objective metrics related to sleep and circadian rhythmicity suggest potential stressors that correlate with higher perceived stress. The participant exhibits significant inconsistency in their sleep patterns, particularly in sleep start time (Z-score 1.55 for standard deviation), which is notably high and positively correlated with PSS. Similarly, the variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.77) also correlates with increased PSS. Circadian rhythm metrics further reinforce this pattern of irregularity, with lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.99), higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.46), and lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.37). These findings indicate a less stable and more fragmented daily rhythm, which are factors consistently associated with elevated perceived stress. Additionally, the slightly below-average amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Z-score -0.13) also shows a negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that this blunted physiological response might be associated with higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

Synthesizing the multimodal data, the participant presents a compelling case for relatively low perceived stress. The overwhelmingly strong evidence from self-reported psychological well-being (high happiness, low anxiety/depression) and excellent baseline physiological health (very low resting heart rate and mesor, adaptive daily HR arousal patterns) provides a robust foundation for mitigating the subjective experience of stress. While objective sleep and circadian rhythm irregularities are significant and correlate with higher PSS, it is plausible that the participant's superior psychological resources and physiological resilience effectively buffer these stressors, preventing them from translating into a high level of *perceived* stress. The fact that their self-reported sleep quality (PSQI Z-score) is better than the population average, despite objective irregularities, further supports this interpretation. Therefore, despite some objective indicators of physiological strain from sleep and rhythm disturbances, the participant's strong subjective well-being and fundamental physiological robustness likely place their overall perceived stress level in the lower half of the study population.

27306,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a robust psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Specifically, scores on the CES-D (Z=-0.76) and STAI (Z=-0.43) scales are below the population average, indicating effective emotional regulation and a reduced propensity for these states. This is further supported by significantly above-average self-esteem (Z=1.66) and high satisfaction with physical health (Z=1.8), suggesting a strong sense of self-worth and positive health perception. Trust in others is also elevated (Z=1.15). While these indicators generally point to a positive psychological state, self-reported happiness (Z=-0.53) is slightly below the population mean, presenting a minor discrepancy within an otherwise highly favorable mental health profile. Academically, the participant maintains a solid GPA with an improving trend over the recorded semesters.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates a highly active and disciplined approach. Engagement in both individual (Z=1.07) and group (Z=1.23) exercise is significantly above the population average, while substance use across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) is minimal or non-existent, indicating a very low-risk health behavior profile. A striking pattern emerges in daily recreational habits: the participant reports very low or no engagement in most passive leisure activities, including watching TV/videos/movies (Z=-1.25), internet usage (Z=-1.83), listening to music (Z=-1.19), reading (Z=-0.67), video games (Z=-0.56), and sedentary hobbies (Z=-0.96). Socializing with friends (Z=-0.62) is also reported as lower than average. This suggests a highly structured and activity-focused daily routine, potentially with limited time allocated to passive relaxation or social leisure.

Sleep patterns are notably healthy, with the participant scoring significantly better than average on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Z=-1.26), categorizing their subjective sleep as ""Good Sleep."" Objective wearable data largely corroborates this, showing a consistent sleep start time (SD Z=-0.57) and relatively consistent, albeit slightly below average, sleep duration (6 hours 42 minutes, Z=-0.6). The low variability in sleep duration and timing points to strong sleep hygiene and a regular sleep schedule.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits exceptional cardiovascular fitness. Their resting heart rate (46.2 bpm, Z=-1.42) and overall 24-hour mean heart rate (Mesor 63.03 bpm, Z=-1.49) are significantly lower than the study population average. The circadian rhythm of heart rate displays a slightly higher amplitude (Z=0.46), signifying a clear distinction between active and resting periods. While interdaily stability (Z=-0.24) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=-0.36) are marginally lower than average, with intradaily variability (Z=0.32) slightly higher, these minor deviations in rhythmicity are unlikely to indicate significant physiological disruption, especially given the participant's overall cardiovascular health. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal pronounced, yet appropriate, physiological arousal during specific times, with exceptionally high peaks in the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z=5.17) and late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z=7.8). These extreme elevations are consistent with the participant's self-reported vigorous exercise regimen rather than chronic hyper-arousal, as they align with expected patterns of intense physical activity in a well-conditioned individual. Heart rates outside of these activity bursts generally fall at or below population averages relative to the mesor, particularly during evening and nocturnal hours.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**:

The participant presents compelling evidence for a perceived stress level in the bottom half of the study population. Psychologically, they report significantly fewer depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.76; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.28) and lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.31). These represent strong indicators of lower stress proneness. Additionally, high self-esteem (Z-score 1.66; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.15) and exceptional health satisfaction (Z-score 1.8; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.08) suggest robust psychological resources for managing stress. Subjectively, sleep quality is excellent (PSQI Z-score -1.26; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.32), a critical factor often inversely related to perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates remarkable cardiovascular fitness, with a very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.42; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.14) and a low daily average heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.49; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.06), both indicating a physiologically unstressed state. Furthermore, a highly disciplined lifestyle with minimal substance use and high engagement in structured exercise provides a strong buffer against perceived stress. Notably, for this study population, lower internet usage (Z-score -1.83; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.1) and less time watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.04) are associated with lower PSS, aligning with the participant's behaviors.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%)**:

There are fewer, and generally weaker, indicators pointing towards a higher perceived stress level. The participant's self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.19), suggesting a potential area of concern. Several leisure-related activities show a pattern where the participant's lower engagement correlates with higher PSS in this dataset; for instance, less reading (Z-score -0.67; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.21), less video game playing (Z-score -0.56; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.14), and less engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.05). Interestingly, higher frequency of exercising alone (Z-score 1.07; positively correlated with PSS, r=0.04) also suggests a potential, albeit weak, link to higher PSS. Minor irregularities in heart rate circadian rhythms, such as slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.24; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.12) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.36; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.17), while not strongly indicative, could theoretically suggest subtle physiological disruptions associated with slightly higher stress. The participant's slightly below-average median sleep duration (Z-score -0.6; negatively correlated with PSS, r=-0.05) also weakly points in this direction.

**Holistic Analysis**:

The comprehensive multimodal data strongly indicates that this participant experiences relatively low levels of perceived stress. The most robust indicators of well-being—low anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, high health satisfaction, excellent subjective sleep quality, and superior cardiovascular health—collectively suggest a highly resilient individual. These factors align consistently with lower PSS scores based on their correlations within the study population. While the participant's lower self-reported happiness and minimal engagement in passive leisure activities, coupled with some minor circadian rhythm irregularities, present some counter-indicators, their influence is significantly overshadowed by the multitude of positive mental and physical health markers. The participant's highly structured and active lifestyle appears to contribute to their overall well-being rather than acting as a net stressor. Therefore, a holistic evaluation of the evidence places the participant's perceived stress level well within the lower half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by strong academic performance and consistent, healthy sleep patterns, alongside notable deviations in psychological traits and daily activity engagement. Academically, the participant demonstrates high achievement with a consistent 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters, suggesting effective coping mechanisms or minimal academic stress burden, or perhaps exceptional academic ability. Psychologically, self-report data indicate a ""not depressed"" classification on the CESD scale, with a slightly below-average Z-score (-0.14) for depressive symptoms, which correlates positively with perceived stress, thus suggesting lower stress. However, the participant reports being ""anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale, with a slightly above-average Z-score (0.37) for chronic anxiety, which correlates positively with perceived stress. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.26), correlating negatively with perceived stress, indicating a protective factor. Self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.45) are notably below average, which, given their negative correlations with PSS, would suggest higher stress. Trust levels are slightly below average.

Sleep architecture, as indicated by both self-report and wearable data, appears generally favorable. The PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8) indicates ""Good Sleep"" quality. Fitbit-derived sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours 16 minutes, slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.11), and a median sleep start time of 01:34 AM. Importantly, both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit less variability than the population average (Z-scores -0.23 and -0.47 respectively). Lower variability in sleep patterns is typically associated with better sleep health and is positively correlated with PSS, implying less variability here is linked to lower PSS. The participant's higher than average daily napping (Z-score 1.09) is positively correlated with PSS, potentially indicating some underlying sleep debt or compensation. Circadian rhythm metrics reveal some noteworthy patterns: Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.37) are lower than average, suggesting less day-to-day regularity in heart rate rhythms. Interestingly, these lower values are negatively correlated with PSS, implying they are associated with lower perceived stress in this population. Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.31) is also lower than average, but this is positively correlated with PSS, suggesting that the participant's less variable heart rate within the day is associated with lower perceived stress. The Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly above average (Z-score 0.43), while the Amplitude is average. The Acrophase, indicating the peak of cardiovascular activity, is later than typical at 6:09 PM.

Physiological arousal, as reflected in hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, indicates a distinct diurnal pattern. The participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rate activity during the late evening and early morning hours, particularly from 10 PM to 1 AM, with Z-scores reaching 1.79 for 11 PM-12 AM and 1.73 for 12 AM-1 AM. This suggests a pattern of heightened physiological activity during typical rest periods, contrasting with exceptionally low heart rates in the early morning (e.g., -23.33 bpm deviation for 6-7 AM, Z-score -0.83). The participant’s resting heart rate (55.8 bpm, Z-score -0.28) is slightly below average, which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness and is positively correlated with PSS, suggesting lower stress. The correlations between these late-night elevated heart rates and PSS are notably negative, implying that this specific pattern of late-night activity is associated with lower perceived stress in this study population, which is an intriguing finding.

Lifestyle behaviors present a mixed picture. The participant engages in significantly more frequent beer consumption than the population average (Z-score 1.72), although this behavior is weakly negatively correlated with PSS. Other substance use is minimal or non-existent. Exercise habits show low frequency for exercising alone or with others, but high engagement in sports (Z-score 0.91), which is negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting a potential stress-buffering effect. Recreational habits are marked by very high internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53), both correlating positively with PSS, possibly reflecting engagement in activities that, for this individual, may carry some underlying stress or stimulation. Conversely, engagement in activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies are reported as very low or non-existent. The absence of reading is negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting lower stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%):**
The primary indicator for a potentially higher PSS score is the participant's elevated trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI (Score: 45.0, Z-score: 0.37), which is classified as ""anxious"" and shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.31). Additionally, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and very low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: -1.45); both have negative correlations with PSS, implying that their low levels on these measures are associated with higher perceived stress. A higher incidence of daily napping (Z-score: 1.09) also correlates positively with PSS (0.14). The participant’s Mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.43) and weakly positively correlated with PSS (0.06). While Intradaily Variability is lower than average (Z-score: -1.31), it is positively correlated with PSS (0.16), suggesting that this pattern is associated with higher perceived stress. High internet usage (Z-score: 2.19) and extensive socializing (Z-score: 2.53) also show weak positive correlations with PSS (0.11 and 0.06 respectively).

**Evidence for Low/Median PSS (Bottom 50%):**
Strong evidence supporting a lower or median PSS score comes from several domains. The participant's CESD score indicates an absence of depressive symptoms (Z-score: -0.14), and since CESD is moderately positively correlated with PSS (0.28), this suggests lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" by the PSQI (Z-score: -0.8). Furthermore, self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.26), correlating negatively with PSS (-0.15), which points to lower stress. The consistent 4.0 GPA across academic semesters suggests a high level of academic functioning that might mitigate stress. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.28), and its positive correlation with PSS (0.14) suggests lower stress. Sleep patterns demonstrate greater stability than average, with lower standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.23) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.47). Given that sleep variability is positively correlated with PSS (0.14 and 0.17, respectively), the participant's lower variability indicates lower perceived stress. Engagement in sports is notably higher than average (Z-score: 0.91) and is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.13), indicating a potential stress-reducing activity. Interestingly, the participant's lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.9) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.37) for heart rate rhythms are both negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12 and -0.17 respectively), suggesting that these particular patterns are associated with lower perceived stress in this population. The higher heart rate activity during late-night hours, while unusual, also shows negative correlations with PSS, further suggesting a link to lower perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety, a primary psychological indicator, a substantial body of evidence across multiple domains points towards relatively lower perceived stress. The absence of depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep quality, higher self-esteem, stable sleep patterns (lower variability in duration and start time), lower resting heart rate, and active participation in sports are all factors associated with lower PSS. The correlations for circadian rhythm metrics, although suggesting less ""regularity"" in a general sense, are specifically linked to *lower* PSS for this participant’s values. The high GPA also suggests effective navigation of academic demands. Despite concerns related to trait anxiety and lower happiness/health satisfaction, the overall balance of objective physiological and behavioral metrics, combined with other protective psychological factors, strongly indicates that the participant's perceived stress level is likely not in the highest range of the student population. The magnitude of the Z-score for trait anxiety (0.37) is not exceptionally high, and it is counterbalanced by other stronger indicators for lower PSS.

23287,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by notable physiological resilience alongside specific behavioral and sleep-related patterns that may contribute to perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a generally stable psychological state, with low scores on both the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) (Z-score -0.76) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Z-score -0.43), classifying them as neither depressed nor anxious. Furthermore, the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.71) and average self-esteem. However, this positive psychological foundation is nuanced by a self-reported happiness score that is below the population average (Z-score -0.53), suggesting an underlying area of concern despite the absence of overt depressive or anxious symptomatology.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates healthy habits in some areas, notably the complete absence of substance use and frequent engagement in exercise, particularly with others (Z-score 1.23 for exercising with others). These activities are generally associated with positive coping mechanisms and reduced stress. Conversely, there is a low level of engagement in several recreational activities, including watching TV, listening to music, and socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41), juxtaposed with a high level of internet usage (Z-score 1.52). This pattern could indicate a more solitary or screen-focused leisure time, potentially reducing opportunities for diverse relaxation or social support, which might contribute to or reflect elevated stress. The participant also shows a declining trend in their GPA, which could serve as an academic stressor.

Sleep architecture presents a seemingly contradictory picture. Subjectively, the participant reports very good sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Z-score -1.72). Objectively, wearable data reveals a long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 23 minutes (Z-score 1.49) and relatively consistent sleep start times (Z-score -0.15 for standard deviation). However, this is accompanied by a higher-than-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.67) and a notably high frequency of daily napping (Z-score 2.07). The median sleep start time is also quite late, close to 1:00 AM. This combination of good subjective quality with objective inconsistencies, high napping, and a late sleep schedule suggests that while total sleep time may be sufficient, the sleep structure might be fragmented or indicative of a delayed sleep phase, potentially impacting daytime alertness or recovery.

Cardiovascular physiology, as derived from wearable data, indicates exceptional physical fitness and robust circadian rhythmicity. The participant exhibits a remarkably low resting heart rate (40.6 bpm, Z-score -2.09) and a significantly low mesor (mean heart rate, Z-score -2.2), indicative of excellent cardiovascular health and a low baseline physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm itself appears well-structured, with above-average amplitude (Z-score 0.56) and interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33), suggesting consistent daily physiological patterns. However, there is slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.17), which can be associated with higher perceived stress. A prominent feature is the pattern of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations: while heart rate is significantly suppressed during early morning hours, reflecting deep rest, there are substantial elevations throughout the day, peaking very significantly in the late evening (9-11 PM, Z-scores up to 2.37). This pronounced late-day physiological arousal, combined with a late acrophase (5:03 PM) and late sleep onset, suggests a delayed internal clock or prolonged engagement in stimulating activities close to bedtime, which could hinder the body's ability to wind down and potentially contribute to feelings of stress despite overall physiological resilience.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on a holistic analysis of the multimodal data, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is likely to place them in the **bottom half** of the study population distribution with regards to their Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower PSS score stems from the participant's strong foundational psychological and physiological resilience. Self-report measures show low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 6.0, Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI score 37.0, Z-score -0.43), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, meaning low scores here strongly predict lower perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates exceptional cardiovascular health, characterized by a remarkably low resting heart rate (40.6 bpm, Z-score -2.09) and mesor (57.82, Z-score -2.2). While RHR has a positive correlation with PSS (0.13), the participant's value is so far below the population mean that it strongly implies a lower stress state. Similarly, a robust circadian rhythm, indicated by above-average amplitude (Z-score 0.56, correlation -0.16) and interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33, correlation -0.12), typically aligns with reduced stress. The participant also reports very good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 3.0, Z-score -1.72) and engages in frequent exercise, which are protective factors against high perceived stress.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, some data points suggest potential stressors or coping patterns that could elevate perceived stress. The participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.19), which predicts higher PSS. Behavioral patterns such as low social engagement (Z-score -1.41) and high internet usage (Z-score 1.52, correlation 0.11), along with a declining GPA trend, could reflect or contribute to stress. Objectively, sleep metrics reveal above-average sleep duration variability (Z-score 0.67, correlation 0.15) and a significantly high frequency of napping (Z-score 2.07, correlation 0.15), both of which correlate positively with PSS. Furthermore, the pattern of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations, particularly the pronounced physiological arousal observed in the late evening (e.g., 9-11 PM with Z-scores above 2.0), combined with a late acrophase and late sleep start time, suggests a delayed activity cycle or difficulty in achieving physiological calm before sleep, which could increase perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite the indicators suggestive of higher stress, particularly related to specific sleep characteristics, behavioral patterns, and late-evening physiological arousal, the predominant evidence points to a resilient profile. The participant's exceptionally low baseline physiological arousal (RHR, Mesor) and the absence of significant self-reported anxiety or depressive symptoms represent powerful protective factors that are strongly predictive of lower perceived stress. While the late-evening heart rate peaks are notable, the overall capacity for physiological regulation appears to be high. The ""good sleep"" self-report, while potentially masking some objective dysregulation, still reflects a subjective experience of adequate rest. Given the profound physiological resilience and low distress scores, these factors likely provide a buffer against significant perceived stress, placing the participant in the bottom half of the population distribution.

28247,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress, pronounced sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, and specific lifestyle patterns. Self-report measures indicate a burdened psychological state, with significantly elevated scores for depressive symptoms (CESD score 29.0, Z-score 1.63) and trait anxiety (STAI score 61.0, Z-score 1.95), both of which are notably higher than the study population average. These indicators are further supported by lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) and reduced satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.03), suggesting a broader sense of psychological vulnerability. While the participant reports above-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55), this may represent a transient state or a coping mechanism given the overall pattern of distress.

Sleep and circadian rhythm metrics are a critical area of concern. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), which is corroborated by wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours 26 minutes (Z-score -0.94), falling below recommended guidelines. Most strikingly, there is extremely high variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 208 minutes, Z-score 2.74), indicating a severely irregular sleep-wake schedule. This pattern of irregularity is consistent with the significantly low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.48) and high Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.51) derived from heart rate data, both reflecting a disorganized and fragmented daily physiological rhythm. Furthermore, the low amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm (Z-score -1.61) suggests a blunted physiological signal, often associated with chronic stress and poor health. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal less pronounced drops in heart rate during early morning sleep hours and relatively elevated heart rates during the 3-8 AM window (positive Z-scores), implying physiological arousal even during periods typically associated with deep rest or an early, potentially abrupt, awakening process.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant exhibits a marked lack of physical exercise, with all categories (exercising alone, with others, and sports) showing Z-scores well below -1.0. This limited engagement in physical activity, a known stress-reducing behavior, could contribute to heightened stress levels. Conversely, the participant demonstrates very high engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53) and listening to music (Z-score 2.06), suggesting these activities may serve as primary sources of social support or recreation. Other recreational activities, such as internet usage, watching TV/videos, and video games, are notably low. The late median sleep start time (01:03:49 AM) further reinforces a lifestyle that is not conducive to stable circadian rhythms, potentially influenced by academic demands or social engagement. Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate (62.2 bpm, Z-score 0.48) is slightly elevated compared to the population mean, which can be a subtle indicator of increased physiological arousal or sympathetic nervous system activation, further contributing to a state of chronic stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

A substantial body of evidence points towards the participant likely having a PSS score in the top 50% of the study population. The self-reported psychological measures are particularly compelling: the participant reports significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 1.63) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.95), both classifications indicating substantial psychological distress. These scores exhibit positive correlations with PSS, suggesting that individuals with higher scores on these measures tend to report higher perceived stress. Additionally, lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) and reduced health satisfaction (Z-score -1.03), both negatively correlated with PSS, further indicate a heightened vulnerability to stress.

The most striking evidence comes from sleep and circadian rhythm data. The PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is profoundly exacerbated by the wearable data, specifically the extremely high standard deviation of sleep start times (Z-score 2.74), which indicates severe sleep schedule irregularity. This dysregulation is reinforced by low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.48), high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51), and a blunted circadian heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.61), all of which suggest a disorganized and potentially strained physiological system commonly associated with elevated stress. The hourly heart rate patterns, showing less deep nocturnal heart rate dips and earlier, relatively higher heart rates in the early morning, further support a state of chronic physiological arousal or impaired recovery. The lack of engagement in physical exercise (all Z-scores below -1.0), a known buffer against stress, also contributes to this pattern.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Evidence suggesting a low or median PSS score is considerably weaker. The participant maintains strong academic performance with consistently good GPAs, which, while not directly correlated with PSS, could imply effective coping in a significant area of university life. Self-reported ""current happiness"" is above average (Z-score 0.55) and is negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting a potential buffer. Furthermore, the participant engages heavily in socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53) and listening to music (Z-score 2.06), both of which can be protective factors against stress. However, the correlations of these activities with PSS are weakly positive, implying they might not be fully mitigating perceived stress in this individual's context, or perhaps represent coping strategies in response to existing stress. Low substance use is also a positive health behavior, though its direct impact on perceived stress is not strongly indicated.

**Holistic Analysis:**

Considering all available data, the robust and multi-faceted evidence of significant psychological distress, profound sleep and circadian rhythm dysregulation, and suboptimal health behaviors (lack of exercise) strongly outweighs the few indicators of potential resilience (academic performance, high social engagement, current happiness). The magnitude of the Z-scores for trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, and especially sleep start time variability are exceptionally high, placing this individual's physiological and psychological systems under considerable strain. While social support and music engagement may offer some mitigation, they appear insufficient to counteract the pervasive indicators of high stress. Therefore, based on this comprehensive analysis, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

72806,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a robust psychological profile characterized by low self-reported symptoms of distress and stable physiological rhythms, suggesting an overall lower experience of perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate that the participant's scores on the CES-D (5.0, Z-score -0.86) and STAI-Trait (33.0, Z-score -0.82) are both notably below the study population average, classifying them as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. These lower symptom burdens correlate positively with perceived stress, thus indicating a lower likelihood of elevated stress. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (39.0, Z-score 0.11), which typically serves as a protective factor against stress. Academic performance is consistently high, with GPAs ranging from 3.7 to 3.94. While overall happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7) are reported to be slightly below the population average, correlating negatively with perceived stress, these concerns appear to be outweighed by the stronger indicators of psychological well-being. Lifestyle habits include generally low substance use and moderate exercise (1-2 times a week exercising alone, Z-score 0.32). Engagement in various daily recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, is comparatively low. Notably, the participant reports reading ""15 minutes or less"" with a Z-score of 0.32, which, given its negative correlation with PSS, aligns with lower perceived stress for this individual.

Objective sleep data and self-reported sleep quality further support a pattern consistent with lower perceived stress. The participant's PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8) indicates ""Good Sleep"" quality, which is better than the population average and correlates negatively with perceived stress. Wearable data reinforces this with an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours 34 minutes (Z-score 0.47) and notably low variability in both sleep duration (85 minutes standard deviation, Z-score -0.36) and sleep start time (68 minutes standard deviation, Z-score -0.32). These consistent sleep patterns are associated with lower perceived stress. However, the participant reports an above-average frequency of daily naps (0.13, Z-score 0.7), which correlates positively with perceived stress and might suggest occasional sleep debt or a need for additional rest despite generally good nighttime sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data reveal above-average interdaily stability (0.47, Z-score 0.5) and amplitude (12.52, Z-score 0.56), signifying a regular and robust daily rhythm in physiological activity, which typically correlates negatively with stress. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed relatively late in the day, at 4:00 PM.

Physiological arousal patterns, as inferred from aggregated hourly heart rate deviations, exhibit distinct daily fluctuations. The participant's resting heart rate (56.4 bpm, Z-score -0.21) is slightly below the population average, correlating positively with perceived stress, meaning a lower resting heart rate is associated with lower stress. During typical sleep hours (1-5 AM), heart rate shows significant negative deviations from the mesor, indicative of deep physiological rest, with Z-scores as low as -1.32. As the day progresses, heart rate gradually increases, with notable positive deviations from the mesor during waking hours. A particularly salient feature is a pronounced peak in heart rate deviation during the early evening (6-7 PM), registering a value of 25.34 (Z-score 2.22). This represents a substantial elevation in cardiovascular activity relative to the mesor and the population average. Intriguingly, this specific peak correlates negatively with perceived stress (-0.13), suggesting that this period of high physiological activity for this individual is not associated with increased stress but rather may reflect engagement in activities that are stress-buffering or are well-managed.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The available evidence predominantly suggests that this participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would likely place them in the **bottom half** of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a relatively low or average PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is strong and pervasive across multiple domains. The participant exhibits significantly lower than average scores on established measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D, Z-score -0.86) and anxiety (STAI, Z-score -0.82), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, thus indicating lower stress. Subjective sleep quality is classified as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI, Z-score -0.8), and objective sleep metrics show above-average duration (7h 34m, Z-score 0.47) and remarkable consistency in both duration and start time (low standard deviations with negative Z-scores), all aligning with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, physiological markers such as above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.5) and amplitude (Z-score 0.56) in circadian rhythms, along with a slightly below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.21), are consistent with a lower stress profile based on their correlations with PSS. Even the most prominent physiological feature, the distinct and substantial heart rate peak in the early evening (Z-score 2.22), correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting it represents a period of functional activity rather than stress-induced arousal.

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is comparatively limited. The participant reports below-average levels of happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7), and these factors correlate negatively with PSS, implying a potential for higher stress. Additionally, above-average daily napping (Z-score 0.7) correlates positively with PSS, indicating a minor contribution to increased stress. While some early morning heart rate deviations, indicative of deep sleep, show positive correlations with PSS, this finding is subtle and complex to interpret in isolation, especially when weighed against the overwhelming evidence for good overall sleep quality and robust circadian regulation.

Considering the strong indicators of low anxiety and depressive symptoms, excellent subjective and objective sleep quality, stable physiological rhythms, and generally favorable health markers, the collective data strongly points towards the participant experiencing lower perceived stress compared to their peers.

39146,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile reveals an average level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.07), suggesting typical chronic anxiety proneness within the study population. Notably, depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z-score -0.24), and the participant reports significantly higher-than-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score 0.68), a psychological buffer negatively correlated with perceived stress. Despite maintaining a consistently high GPA (around 3.7), indicating strong academic performance and competence, self-reported happiness is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.53). Overall satisfaction with physical health is above average (Z-score 0.38). This suggests a psychologically stable individual with strong self-regard and academic success, yet experiencing a mild deficit in general subjective well-being.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates a strong adherence to healthy substance use behaviors, reporting ""Not at all"" across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), with significantly low corresponding Z-scores. This abstinence is generally associated with lower stress. However, formal exercise engagement is notably low; all exercise categories are reported as ""Not at all"" or ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" resulting in significantly negative Z-scores. This lack of physical activity, which typically serves as a stress mitigator, represents a potential area for increased stress. Recreational time is primarily devoted to solitary, screen-based activities: the participant engages in significantly more video gaming (Z-score 2.47) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41) than the average student, along with above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.85) and music listening (Z-score 1.13). Conversely, time spent watching TV/videos and reading is comparatively lower. The high engagement in video games, notably, is negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting it may function as an effective personal coping mechanism for this individual.

The participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (Z-score -0.8), indicating fewer perceived sleep difficulties than the general population. Objectively, wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours 48 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.47). A prominent feature is the remarkable consistency in sleep duration, with a standard deviation of 62 minutes (Z-score -0.89), reflecting a highly regular sleep schedule. The median sleep start time of 01:32:15 indicates a late bedtime, though the variability in this timing is average (Z-score 0.01). The participant also reports no daily napping, which is less common than the population average (Z-score -0.86). This profile indicates that despite a somewhat restricted total sleep time and a late chronotype, the participant experiences consistent and subjectively good quality sleep.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicates an elevated baseline of cardiovascular activity. The participant's resting heart rate (65.4 bpm, Z-score 0.86) and mean heart rate (Mesor 78.4, Z-score 0.61) are both higher than average for the study population, positively correlating with perceived stress. While the heart rate data demonstrates strong 24-hour regularity (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 1.15) and slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.42), it also exhibits slightly above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.53), suggesting some within-day heart rate fluctuations despite overall rhythm consistency. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 3:57 PM. Detailed analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals typical deep nocturnal troughs, followed by a rapid increase in heart rate during morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM Z-score 0.64). Notably, the participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rate activity in the late afternoon and early evening, with Z-scores of 0.65 (5-6 PM) and 0.57 (6-7 PM) indicating levels well above the population mean during these times. This pattern of sustained and elevated physiological arousal extending into the evening, alongside a higher baseline heart rate, points towards a heightened state of physiological activation.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**

Several factors suggest the participant likely experiences lower-than-average perceived stress. Psychologically, above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.68, correlation -0.16) and below-average depressive symptoms (Z-score -0.24, correlation 0.28) act as strong protective factors against stress. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8), indicating that sleep is not a perceived stressor. Objectively, sleep exhibits high consistency in duration (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score -0.89, correlation 0.15) and circadian rhythms show strong 24-hour regularity (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 1.15, correlation -0.18) and above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.42, correlation -0.12). These patterns of regularity in biological rhythms are consistently associated with lower stress levels. Furthermore, the participant's significantly high engagement in video games (Z-score 2.47), which is negatively correlated with PSS (correlation -0.14), suggests an effective personal coping mechanism. Abstinence from substance use also contributes to a healthier lifestyle, likely moderating stress.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**

Conversely, several indicators point towards potentially elevated perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a higher-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score 0.86, correlation 0.13) and mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.61, correlation 0.06), which are direct physiological markers of arousal positively correlated with PSS. Hourly heart rate data confirms sustained and elevated physiological activity in the late afternoon and early evening, indicating prolonged activation. Psychologically, self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.19), suggesting a deficit in overall well-being that aligns with higher stress. The average level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.07, correlation 0.31) also contributes to the stress burden. Behaviorally, the participant reports very low levels of formal exercise across all categories, which is a known risk factor for increased stress. Additionally, internet usage is above average (Z-score 0.85) and positively correlated with PSS (correlation 0.1), suggesting this activity may not always be a stress buffer.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The participant presents a complex interplay of stress-related factors. While there are clear physiological indicators of elevated arousal (high RHR, high Mesor, sustained evening HR activity), the participant also possesses substantial psychological and behavioral resources that likely buffer the perception of stress. Key protective factors include high self-esteem, robust circadian rhythm regularity, consistent and subjectively good sleep, and high engagement in a negatively correlated coping activity (video games). When considering the cumulative impact, particularly the strength of factors like self-esteem, circadian regularity, and the use of effective coping mechanisms that directly reduce perceived stress (as indicated by negative correlations), these appear to significantly counteract the physiological arousal and lifestyle elements that might otherwise elevate stress perception. The participant's perceived experience of good sleep quality is particularly important, as poor sleep is a major contributor to perceived stress. Given the weighting of these factors and their relationships with PSS, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's coping and resilience mechanisms are effective in maintaining a perceived stress level at or below the population average.

67918,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile characterized by minimal symptoms of depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and notable academic success. Self-reported scores on the CES-D (5.0, Z-score -0.86) and STAI-Trait (35.0, Z-score -0.62) scales indicate a significantly lower burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to the study population, both of which generally correlate positively with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports significantly high self-esteem (48.0, Z-score 1.38) and high satisfaction with physical health (5.89, Z-score 1.22), factors typically associated with lower perceived stress. Academic performance is consistently high, with GPAs ranging from 3.89 to 3.94 across several semesters, suggesting effective management of academic demands. While reported current happiness (3.0, Z-score -0.53) is slightly below the population average and negatively correlated with PSS, this finding is largely counterbalanced by the strength of other psychological well-being indicators.

Sleep patterns are indicative of excellent quality and consistency, contributing positively to the participant's overall well-being. The self-reported PSQI score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.72) classifies the participant as having ""Good Sleep,"" significantly better than the study population. This is strongly supported by wearable data, which reveals a notably long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 42 minutes (Z-score 1.88). Furthermore, the participant exhibits low variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 74 minutes, Z-score -0.6) and sleep start times (standard deviation 55 minutes, Z-score -0.6), suggesting a highly regular sleep schedule. These consistent and high-quality sleep patterns are typically associated with lower levels of perceived stress.

The participant's physiological data reflects a highly stable and well-regulated heart rate-based circadian rhythm. Key parametric and non-parametric measures indicate strong rhythmicity: interdaily stability (0.59, Z-score 1.49) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.52, Z-score 1.65) are significantly high, while intradaily variability (0.37, Z-score -1.24) is remarkably low. The circadian amplitude of 15.71 (Z-score 1.59) is also high, demonstrating a pronounced and consistent daily fluctuation in heart rate. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate this robust rhythm, with substantial decreases during typical sleep hours (e.g., -22.68 around 3-4 AM) and significant elevations during peak daytime activity (e.g., 19.68 around 2-3 PM), with an acrophase at 3:42 PM. While the overall mesor (81.27, Z-score 1.0) and resting heart rate (62.8, Z-score 0.55) are slightly elevated compared to the population, the overwhelming evidence of a strong and highly regular circadian rhythm suggests effective physiological regulation rather than chronic stress-induced dysregulation.

Behavioral habits further contribute to a generally healthy lifestyle. The participant reports no usage across all surveyed substance categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), with consistently low Z-scores, indicating a minimal engagement in substance use. Exercise frequency is somewhat below the population average for both solitary and social activities, and participation in sports is reported as ""not at all."" Daily recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing, are generally within average ranges. Notably, time spent reading, though reported as 15 minutes or less, shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), aligning with a potential stress-buffering effect.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The preponderance of evidence strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level would fall within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. Key psychological indicators, such as very low CES-D (Z-score -0.86) and STAI (Z-score -0.62) scores, point to minimal depressive and anxious symptoms, which are directly associated with lower PSS scores. High self-esteem (Z-score 1.38) and high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22), both negatively correlated with PSS, further support this. Exceptional academic performance and a lack of substance use also align with a well-adapted individual. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.72), notably long sleep duration (Z-score 1.88), and highly consistent sleep patterns (low variability in duration and start time), all robust indicators of lower stress. The heart rate-derived circadian rhythm is exceptionally strong and stable, with high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.49), low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.24), high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.65), and high amplitude (Z-score 1.59), all negatively correlated with PSS, signifying strong physiological regulation against stressors.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a high perceived stress level is minimal and relatively weak in comparison to the opposing data. The participant's self-reported current happiness (Z-score -0.53) is slightly below average, a factor negatively correlated with PSS, which could infer slightly higher stress. Additionally, the participant's Mesor (Z-score 1.0) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.55) are slightly elevated compared to the population, both positively correlated with PSS. These elevated baseline heart rate metrics could suggest a degree of physiological arousal. However, this interpretation is substantially mitigated by the overall strength and regularity of the participant's circadian rhythm, which typically indicates healthy physiological coping and adaptation.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the extensive and consistent evidence for low depressive and anxious symptoms, high self-esteem, excellent and consistent sleep quality, and a remarkably stable and robust physiological circadian rhythm overwhelmingly indicates a low level of perceived stress. While minor indicators like slightly lower happiness and marginally elevated baseline heart rate exist, they are overshadowed by the strong and numerous markers of psychological resilience and physiological well-being. The participant's overall profile reflects effective coping mechanisms and a well-regulated system, making a high PSS score unlikely.

34467,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex profile, demonstrating robust psychological well-being alongside notable patterns of physiological and sleep dysregulation. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a favorable state; scores on the CES-D and STAI scales are significantly below the population mean (Z-scores of -0.66 and -0.82 respectively), classifying the participant as 'not depressed' and 'not anxious.' This suggests a lower burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to peers, and these lower scores are associated with lower perceived stress (correlations of 0.28 and 0.31 with PSS). High self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and remarkably high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64), both negatively correlated with PSS, further support a generally positive subjective state. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently high GPAs, also suggests competence and potentially fewer academic stressors. The participant reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.8), which is negatively correlated with PSS. Engagement in substance use is very low, as evidenced by large negative Z-scores for beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drug use, suggesting an absence of these potentially maladaptive coping behaviors. Exercise habits are generally healthy, with above-average frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 1.23), a behavior often associated with social support and stress reduction. Recreational screen time activities are notably low, indicating a preference for less passive leisure.

However, the participant's sleep patterns and physiological regulation present a contrasting picture. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as 'Disturbed Sleep' (score 8, Z-score 0.59), indicating poorer sleep than the average student. Objective Fitbit data corroborates issues with sleep consistency: while median sleep duration is adequate at 7 hours 24 minutes (Z-score 0.28), there is considerable variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 128 minutes, Z-score 0.61) and especially sleep start time (standard deviation of 134 minutes, Z-score 1.12). Both of these variability metrics are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting that inconsistent sleep patterns contribute to higher perceived stress. The participant also averages an above-average number of daily naps (Z-score 0.61), which is positively correlated with PSS and may act as a compensatory mechanism for inconsistent main sleep.

Physiological data derived from heart rate further highlights areas of potential dysregulation. The participant exhibits excellent baseline cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a very low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z-score -1.49) and a significantly low MESOR (Z-score -2.13), indicating a lower overall average heart rate compared to the population. These lower values are positively correlated with PSS, implying that lower RHR and Mesor are associated with lower perceived stress. However, despite this strong baseline, measures of heart rate dynamics suggest instability. Intradaily Variability is notably high (Z-score 1.44), reflecting greater and more frequent heart rate fluctuations within a day, a metric positively correlated with PSS. Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.61) are both below average, indicating less day-to-day regularity in heart rate rhythms; for this population, these lower values are negatively correlated with PSS, which is counter-intuitive if interpreted as a lack of rhythmic structure. The hourly heart rate profile reveals a remarkably pronounced and early morning heart rate surge, with deviations from the MESOR at 7-8 AM (Z-score 3.24) and 8-9 AM (Z-score 2.26) that are exceptionally high. These morning peaks are positively correlated with PSS, strongly suggesting that this pattern of physiological hyper-arousal or reactivity contributes to elevated perceived stress. A secondary, albeit less dramatic, increase in heart rate deviation is also observed in the early evening.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents compelling evidence for a lower or average perceived stress level through their psychological well-being. They report very low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.66) and anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.82), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, meaning their low scores point to lower stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and notably high happiness (Z-score 1.64), both negatively correlated with PSS, further support a resilient psychological disposition. Academic success, lack of substance use, and engagement in social exercise also align with generally lower stress. Physiologically, an exceptionally low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.49) and Mesor (Z-score -2.13) suggest excellent cardiovascular fitness, and these lower baseline heart rate values are positively correlated with PSS, implying a healthier physiological baseline associated with lower perceived stress.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, significant physiological and sleep-related findings strongly indicate a higher perceived stress level. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI score 8, Z-score 0.59). Objectively, Fitbit data shows high inconsistency in sleep duration (Z-score 0.61) and especially sleep start time (Z-score 1.12), with both metrics positively correlated with PSS, signifying that greater irregularity contributes to higher perceived stress. High Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.44) in heart rate, which is positively correlated with PSS, points to fragmented physiological activity or heightened reactivity within the day. Most critically, the hourly heart rate data reveals an extremely pronounced and early morning heart rate surge (e.g., 7-8 AM Z-score 3.24, 8-9 AM Z-score 2.26), which represents a significant physiological arousal response. The strong positive correlations between these heightened morning heart rate deviations and PSS are powerful indicators of elevated perceived stress. The higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.61), also positively correlated with PSS, may further suggest compensatory behaviors for overall sleep deficits or dysregulation.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile demonstrates a striking dichotomy. While their self-reported psychological state appears robust, marked by low anxiety and depression, high happiness, and excellent academic performance, the objective physiological and sleep data suggest considerable internal strain and dysregulation. The excellent cardiovascular fitness (low RHR and Mesor) provides a strong foundation, yet this is undermined by highly unstable sleep patterns and significant physiological hyper-reactivity, particularly the exceptionally strong morning heart rate surge and high intradaily variability. These specific physiological and sleep disturbances are not only pronounced in their deviation from the population mean (indicated by high Z-scores) but are also directly and positively correlated with higher PSS scores within the study population. The magnitude of these physiological deviations, such as the Z-score of 3.24 for the morning heart rate surge, is particularly compelling. Despite psychological resilience, the persistent physiological burden and inconsistent sleep are likely to manifest as elevated perceived stress. Therefore, considering the objective evidence of significant physiological dysregulation and disturbed sleep, which are strongly linked to perceived stress, these factors are likely to outweigh the positive psychological self-reports in determining the participant's overall PSS score.

59673,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by notably positive psychological well-being alongside indicators of disturbed and irregular sleep patterns and distinct physiological arousal. Psychologically, the individual reports very low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 7.0, Z-score -0.66) and anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score -0.43), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" relative to the study population. Furthermore, self-esteem is exceptionally high (score of 50.0, Z-score 1.66), and reported happiness is above average (score of 4.0, Z-score 0.55). These self-reported measures of psychological health are strong indicators of resilience and positive coping. However, health satisfaction is markedly low (score of 2.67, Z-score -1.2), suggesting a potential underlying physical health concern or dissatisfaction that does not align with their otherwise positive psychological outlook. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with an improving GPA across semesters, suggesting effective academic coping or high investment in studies.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits several notable patterns. Alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, is reported at ""1-2 times a week,"" which is above the population average (Z-score 0.94). Engagement in exercise is moderate, with ""1-2 times a week"" for both exercising alone and with others. A striking aspect of the participant's lifestyle is a comparatively low engagement in various recreational activities. They report ""15 minutes or less"" for watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies, and ""Do not do"" for video games and reading. Time spent socializing with friends is also reported as ""31 minutes an hour,"" which is below average (Z-score -0.62). This limited engagement in leisure activities may suggest a highly focused individual, potentially dedicating time to academics, or it could indicate a reduced repertoire of stress-buffering behaviors, which typically include leisure and social interaction.

Sleep patterns present a notable area of concern. Despite an objectively measured median sleep duration of 7 hours and 37 minutes, which is above the population average (Z-score 0.54), the participant self-reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59). This discrepancy highlights a subjective experience of poor sleep quality even when duration is adequate. Objective data further reveal significant irregularities: sleep duration exhibits high variability (standard deviation of 144 minutes, Z-score 0.98), and the median sleep start time is late, at 01:21:00. The participant also averages an above-average frequency of daily naps (Z-score 1.27), which, in conjunction with late and variable sleep onset and duration, suggests a highly fragmented and inconsistent sleep schedule.

Physiologically, heart rate data indicates a generally stable circadian rhythm with average interdaily stability and amplitude. The resting heart rate (57.2 BPM, Z-score -0.11) is within the average range for the population. However, the 24-hour autocorrelation is below average (Z-score -0.7), suggesting less predictability and regularity in daily heart rate patterns. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct periods of elevated physiological arousal. Notably, heart rate is significantly above the mesor during afternoon and evening hours (e.g., 1-2 PM with a deviation of 15.48, Z-score 1.22; 6-7 PM with a deviation of 20.83, Z-score 1.44), indicating high activity or arousal during these times. Crucially, high deviations persist late into the night, particularly between 11 PM and 1 AM (11-12 AM deviation 13.43, Z-score 1.49; 12-1 AM deviation 10.23, Z-score 1.72), which might interfere with sleep onset or reflect persistent physiological activation even at times typically associated with winding down. Interestingly, for several of these high-deviation periods (e.g., 1-2 PM, 6-7 PM, 11 PM-1 AM), the correlation with PSS is negative, meaning that individuals with higher heart rate deviations at these times tend to report *lower* perceived stress in the study population.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits strong self-reported psychological well-being that would typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Their CES-D and STAI scores are significantly below the population mean, indicating an absence of clinical depression or anxiety. Self-esteem is exceptionally high (Z-score 1.66), and happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55). These psychological traits are often inversely related to perceived stress, with higher self-esteem and happiness acting as protective factors. The correlations provided further support this; low CESD and STAI scores, and high self-esteem and happiness scores, are associated with lower PSS. Additionally, while the participant shows significant physiological arousal during certain daily and late-night hours (e.g., 1-2 PM, 6-7 PM, 11 PM-1 AM with Z-scores exceeding 1.2), the accompanying score correlations for these specific periods are *negative* (e.g., -0.18, -0.13, -0.14). This suggests that within the study population, individuals exhibiting higher heart rate deviations at these times actually tend to report *lower* perceived stress, potentially indicating a highly active or engaged lifestyle that is not perceived as burdensome by this individual. The participant's high and improving GPA also points to effective management of academic demands.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**
Conversely, several indicators suggest potential sources of elevated stress. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating subjective sleep difficulties. This is further supported by objective Fitbit data showing high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.98), a late median sleep start time (01:21:00), and above-average daily napping (Z-score 1.27), all of which can be hallmarks of an irregular sleep-wake cycle often associated with stress. The participant also reports notably low satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -1.2). The below-average engagement in a range of typical recreational activities (e.g., watching TV, video games, reading, socializing with friends, sedentary hobbies) could imply a lack of sufficient leisure time or stress-coping outlets. Furthermore, the elevated consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94) might, in some cases, serve as a maladaptive coping mechanism for stress, although this is not explicitly stated.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are clear objective and subjective indicators of sleep disturbance and distinct physiological arousal patterns, the robust and consistently positive self-reported psychological well-being measures (low anxiety/depression, high self-esteem/happiness) are particularly salient in the context of *perceived* stress. The PSS specifically measures the subjective appraisal of stress. The participant's core psychological resources appear strong, potentially buffering the impact of sleep issues or a demanding lifestyle. Furthermore, the counter-intuitive negative correlations between elevated physiological arousal at specific times and PSS scores suggest that for this individual, or similar individuals in the population, physiological activation might be linked to engagement rather than distress. Given the strong evidence from psychological self-reports directly pertaining to subjective well-being and their negative correlations with PSS, it is most probable that this participant's overall perceived stress level falls into the bottom half of the study population.

74899,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with several notable psychological and behavioral patterns that collectively offer insight into their perceived stress levels. Psychologically, there is evidence of elevated anxiety and depressive symptomatology. The STAI-Trait score of 52, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.06, indicates significantly above-average chronic anxiety, classifying the participant as ""anxious,"" a finding that positively correlates with perceived stress. Similarly, the CESD score of 17, with a Z-score of 0.38, suggests a mild but above-average burden of depressive symptoms, classifying the participant as ""depressed,"" which also correlates positively with perceived stress. Consistent with these indicators, the participant reported below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.87) and happiness (Z-score -0.53), both of which inversely correlate with perceived stress. In contrast, health satisfaction was reported as notably high (Z-score 1.3), despite its weak correlation with perceived stress, potentially suggesting a specific focus on or perception of physical health that deviates from other psychological well-being measures.

Sleep quality and duration emerge as significant areas of concern. The participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9, with a Z-score of 1.05, indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This self-reported poor sleep quality is corroborated by objective wearable data, revealing a median nightly sleep duration of only 5 hours and 58 minutes, corresponding to a highly negative Z-score of -1.52 relative to the study population. This suggests severe and chronic sleep deprivation. While the standard deviation for both sleep duration (84 minutes, Z-score -0.39) and sleep start time (65 minutes, Z-score -0.38) is near or slightly below average, indicating a relatively consistent, albeit very late (median start time 02:25:30), sleep schedule, the brevity of sleep remains a critical factor impacting well-being and stress. No daily naps were reported.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices indicates a moderately elevated baseline physiological arousal. The participant’s Mesor (mean heart rate across the recording period) is 80.87 bpm, with a Z-score of 0.95, indicating a higher general heart rate activity level compared to peers. The resting heart rate of 62.1 bpm (Z-score 0.47) is also slightly above the population average. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals typical nocturnal dips, with the lowest activity observed between 7-8 AM (-21.29 bpm from Mesor). However, a pronounced peak in heart rate activity occurs in the late afternoon, specifically between 5-6 PM, showing a deviation of 22.1 bpm above the Mesor, which is a substantial surge. This aligns with a relatively late acrophase (peak of the circadian heart rate rhythm) at 5:49 PM, suggesting a strong and somewhat delayed daily peak in physiological activity or arousal. Other circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.17) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.46), are close to the population average, suggesting that despite the elevated baseline and shifted acrophase, the daily pattern of heart rate activity exhibits a degree of regularity.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a strong engagement in physical activity, exercising alone ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.07) and participating in sports ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.91), which could serve as a positive coping mechanism for stress. Substance usage appears moderate, with beer consumed ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 1.01), but minimal to no use of other substances. Daily recreation habits reveal low engagement in quiet, potentially stress-reducing activities such as reading or sedentary hobbies (""Do not do"" for both, with negative Z-scores), while internet usage and socializing with friends are at moderate levels. Academically, the participant's GPA shows a slight downward trend over three semesters (from 3.5 to 3.24), which could potentially contribute to or reflect academic stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data to assess the participant's overall perceived stress level relative to the study population, several robust indicators suggest a higher level of stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for elevated perceived stress comes from the self-report measures. The participant's STAI score classified them as ""anxious"" (Z-score 1.06), and the CESD score classified them as ""depressed"" (Z-score 0.38); both scales directly correlate positively with PSS scores. Furthermore, the PSQI score indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Z-score 1.05) is a strong correlate of stress. Objectively, the median sleep duration of less than 6 hours (Z-score -1.52) points to severe chronic sleep deprivation, a significant stressor. Lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.87) and happiness (Z-score -0.53), which negatively correlate with PSS, further support higher stress. Physiologically, the elevated Mesor heart rate (Z-score 0.95) and slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.47) indicate a higher baseline physiological arousal, often associated with stress. The participant's consistent pattern of late and short sleep, coupled with a late afternoon peak in heart rate activity, may further exacerbate or reflect underlying stress. The slight decline in GPA over semesters could also contribute to academic stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Conversely, some data points suggest potential resilience or areas of lower stress. The participant reports high satisfaction with their health (Z-score 1.3), although this does not strongly correlate with PSS. They engage frequently in physical exercise, both alone and through sports, which can be a significant buffer against stress. Their circadian rhythm regularity metrics (Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability) are near the population average, indicating some consistency in daily physiological patterns. Trust in others is high (Z-score 1.79), though its correlation with PSS is weak. The variability in sleep duration and start time is relatively low, suggesting a consistent schedule, even if the schedule itself is suboptimal. Substance use, beyond moderate beer consumption, is minimal.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits healthy coping mechanisms such as regular exercise and some physiological rhythm regularity, these are substantially outweighed by the pronounced indicators of psychological distress and severe sleep disturbance. The elevated scores in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with clinically disturbed and severely inadequate sleep duration, strongly point towards a heightened experience of perceived stress. The objective physiological markers of elevated baseline heart rate further support a state of increased arousal. The negative psychological well-being indicators (low self-esteem and happiness) and the academic performance trend are also consistent with elevated stress. Therefore, based on the totality of evidence, the participant's perceived stress level is likely elevated relative to their peers.

35011,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and physiological profile. Self-report data indicate a noteworthy level of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 20, classifying the participant as ""Depressed"" and placing them above the population mean (Z-score 0.7). This contrasts with a self-reported trait anxiety (STAI) score that is below the population average (Z-score -0.52), indicating a stable disposition towards lower anxiety. The participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and above-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55). However, a significant concern is the participant's very low satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -1.78) and a pattern of declining academic performance as evidenced by a consistent decrease in GPA across academic semesters. These factors suggest a complex internal state, where self-perceptions of well-being are partially protective, yet underlying distress and dissatisfaction are evident.

Behavioral habits reveal a mixed picture. The participant reports above-average usage of alcohol, specifically beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94), which could potentially serve as a coping mechanism or contribute to health impacts. Engagement in exercise is generally low to average across categories, with frequencies of ""1-2 times a month"" for exercising alone, with others, and sports activities. Daily recreational habits indicate below-average socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and a complete absence of reading or sedentary hobbies, alongside above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies. This pattern suggests a potentially less active and less socially engaged lifestyle compared to peers, which could impact resilience to stress.

Sleep patterns show significant disturbances. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 7, Z-score 0.13), indicating subjective difficulties. Wearable data corroborates this with a median sleep duration of 6 hours 5 minutes, which is significantly below the population average (Z-score -1.37). Furthermore, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:34:00 AM. Despite the short duration and late start, the participant exhibits relatively consistent sleep duration (SD 63 minutes, Z-score -0.87) and start times (SD 70 minutes, Z-score -0.28). This suggests a consistent but insufficient and displaced sleep schedule, which can have cumulative physiological consequences.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors point towards a state of chronic physiological arousal and dysregulated circadian rhythms. The participant exhibits a very high resting heart rate (77.6 bpm, Z-score 2.31) and an elevated Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) of 86.67 bpm (Z-score 1.74), both indicative of a heightened physiological baseline. Circadian rhythm metrics further underscore this dysregulation: Interdaily Stability is very low (Z-score -1.98) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z-score -1.62), reflecting irregular daily patterns. High Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.37) suggests fragmented activity/rest cycles throughout the day, while a very low Amplitude (Z-score -2.1) indicates a blunted daily rhythm in heart rate, potentially signifying a less robust or dysregulated circadian system. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations from the Mesor show expected daily fluctuations, with lower rates during early morning sleep periods and elevated rates during daytime and evening, but these occur against a backdrop of an overall elevated heart rate baseline, suggesting a sustained state of physiological activation. The Acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is observed relatively late in the day at 5:46 PM.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess whether the participant's overall perceived stress level likely places them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution (relative to the population median PSS of 22.0), we consider convergent evidence from self-report, behavioral habits, and physiological measures.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The participant's CESD score of 20, classifying them as ""Depressed,"" carries a positive correlation with PSS (0.29), indicating that higher depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is reported as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI score 7), which is a common correlate of heightened stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits very low satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -1.78) and a pattern of declining academic performance, both of which are frequently associated with increased stress in a university population.

Critically, objective physiological data from wearables strongly support a state of chronic stress. The participant's resting heart rate (Z-score 2.31) and average heart rate (Mesor, Z-score 1.74) are significantly elevated, reflecting a persistent state of physiological arousal, and both correlate positively with PSS. Their circadian rhythm patterns are notably disrupted, with very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.98), high Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.37), and a very low Amplitude (Z-score -2.1), all of which have correlations consistent with higher perceived stress. The significantly short median sleep duration (6 hours 5 minutes, Z-score -1.37) is also a strong indicator of an unhealthy stress response. Additionally, below-average socializing with friends may indicate reduced social support, a protective factor against stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Countervailing evidence includes a self-reported STAI score (Z-score -0.52) indicating lower trait anxiety, which is typically inversely related to stress. The participant also reports relatively high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and slightly above-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55), both of which are generally considered protective factors against perceived stress and correlate negatively with PSS.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits some positive psychological traits such as lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, and happiness, the overall picture, particularly when integrating the objective physiological and behavioral data, strongly suggests an elevated perceived stress level. The presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, very low health satisfaction, and declining academic performance provide important contextual indicators. Most compellingly, the wearable data consistently reveals patterns of chronic physiological arousal (elevated RHR, high Mesor) and severe dysregulation of circadian rhythms (very low Interdaily Stability, high Intradaily Variability, very low Amplitude), which are robust indicators of a system under chronic strain. The correlations provided reinforce that these specific physiological and behavioral markers are associated with higher perceived stress within the study population. The weight of this evidence, particularly from the physiological domain, outweighs the self-reported psychological buffers.

Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant’s overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

89710,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This analysis integrates self-reported psychological and behavioral data with physiological metrics derived from wearable devices to evaluate the participant's perceived stress levels within a university student population.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a notably elevated psychological distress profile. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are very high (Score: 39.0, Z-score: 2.67), placing the individual significantly above the study population mean and indicating a considerable burden of depressive symptomatology. Similarly, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is elevated (Score: 55.0, Z-score: 1.35), reflecting a higher propensity for chronic anxiety. Both of these psychological distress indicators are positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, several measures of general well-being are notably diminished; self-esteem is low (Score: 25.0, Z-score: -1.85), as are current happiness (Score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61) and satisfaction with physical health (Score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.7). A low score on trust (Z-score: -1.74) further suggests potential challenges in social interactions or worldview. This collective pattern of elevated distress and reduced well-being forms a strong psychological substrate often associated with heightened perceived stress.

Sleep patterns exhibit significant disruption. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is notably poor (Score: 10.0, Z-score: 1.52), indicating clinically relevant sleep disturbance. Objectively, while median sleep duration (6 hours 44 minutes, Z-score: -0.56) is only slightly below the population average, the consistency of sleep onset is highly irregular, evidenced by a large standard deviation in sleep start time (133 minutes, Z-score: 1.09). This irregularity is corroborated by wearable-derived circadian metrics, which show significantly low interdaily stability (Value: 0.22, Z-score: -1.56), reflecting inconsistent daily heart rate patterns, and a reduced heart rate amplitude (Value: 7.57, Z-score: -1.04), suggesting a blunted physiological response to the 24-hour cycle. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:57 PM, indicating a potential shift in the timing of peak physiological arousal. This combination of subjective poor sleep, objective irregularity, and blunted circadian amplitude points to a dysregulated sleep-wake and physiological rhythm.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct physiological patterns throughout the day. During nocturnal hours, particularly between 4-5 AM, the participant exhibits heart rate drops that are more pronounced (deviation of -12.1 BPM from mesor) than the population average for those times (Z-score: 1.0). Conversely, physiological arousal is distinctly elevated in the late afternoon and early evening, peaking at a considerable 20.32 BPM above the mesor between 5-6 PM (Z-score: 1.43). This aligns with the late acrophase, indicating a strong period of sympathetic activation later in the day which could impact evening wind-down. Behavioral habits include substantial engagement in screen-based activities such as internet usage (Z-score: 2.19) and video games (Z-score: 1.71), alongside extensive listening to music (Z-score: 2.06). While exercise is reported with others at an average frequency, solitary exercise is below average. The participant's Body Mass Index of 26.6 indicates an overweight classification. Overall, the pattern suggests significant screen time and a late-day physiological peak that could contribute to or be a consequence of the noted psychological and sleep disturbances.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on a comprehensive review of the participant's self-reported psychological measures, sleep quality, circadian rhythm metrics, and daily behavioral patterns, there is substantial evidence indicating a high level of perceived stress, likely placing their PSS score in the top 50% of the study population.

Evidence supporting a high PSS score is robust across multiple domains. The participant demonstrates significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 2.67) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.35), both of which are strongly positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-reported well-being measures, including self-esteem (Z-score: -1.85), current happiness (Z-score: -1.61), trust (Z-score: -1.74), and health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.70), are all notably low; for these inversely correlated measures, lower scores are indicative of higher perceived stress. Sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI Z-score: 1.52), and objective wearable data reveal significant sleep start time variability (Z-score: 1.09) and low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.56) in heart rate patterns, both positively associated with increased stress. The blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score: -1.04) also suggests a physiological dysregulation often observed in stressed individuals. Furthermore, very high internet usage (Z-score: 2.19) and listening to music (Z-score: 2.06) show a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. The pronounced late-day physiological arousal, peaking between 5-6 PM, aligns with a shift in the acrophase, potentially contributing to difficulties in winding down.

Minor evidence for a lower PSS score is limited to specific behaviors like higher reading time (Z-score: 1.3) and higher video game usage (Z-score: 1.71), both showing weak negative correlations with PSS, and no beer usage (Z-score: -1.12), which also has a weak negative correlation. However, the magnitude and number of these indicators are vastly overshadowed by the compelling evidence for elevated psychological distress and physiological dysregulation.

In conclusion, the preponderance of evidence, particularly from the highly elevated scores on depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with poor subjective sleep quality and objective circadian irregularities, strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level is high within the study population.

97596,32.0,1.0,"The analysis of this participant's multimodal data reveals a complex interplay of psychological distress, disturbed sleep patterns, and physiological arousal, alongside certain adaptive behavioral strategies. The evidence, combining self-reported psychological states, objective sleep metrics, activity patterns, and physiological markers, provides a comprehensive picture for evaluating perceived stress.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates significant psychological distress as indicated by several self-report measures. The CES-D score (33.0, Z-score 2.05) indicates a high burden of depressive symptoms, classifying the individual as ""Depressed"" and correlating positively with perceived stress. Similarly, trait anxiety, measured by the STAI, is elevated (47.0, Z-score 0.56), also showing a positive correlation with stress. Concomitantly, self-reported happiness is notably low (2.0, Z-score -1.61) and negatively correlated with perceived stress, reinforcing the presence of internalizing symptoms and a generally negative emotional state. While self-esteem is average (Z-score -0.31), it does not significantly mitigate the observed distress. Academic performance, as evidenced by recent GPAs (3.34-3.81), suggests the participant maintains a level of functional output despite these internal challenges.

Sleep quality and patterns represent a critical area of concern. The participant reports severely disturbed subjective sleep quality, scoring exceptionally high on the PSQI (15.0, Z-score 3.83), which is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This stands in contrast to objectively measured median sleep duration, which is above average (8 hours 10 minutes, Z-score 1.22). While this suggests sufficient time spent in bed, the high PSQI score indicates that the sleep obtained is likely not restorative or is fraught with difficulties, highlighting a significant discrepancy between objective quantity and subjective quality. Sleep duration variability is lower than average (Z-score -0.92), suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule in terms of duration, which is weakly associated with lower perceived stress. However, this regularity does not appear to overcome the profound subjective sleep disturbance.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits signs consistent with heightened arousal. The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (63.6 bpm, Z-score 0.65) and positively correlated with perceived stress. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data indicates above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.81), which is positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting more fragmented or unstable physiological rhythms throughout the day. While interdaily stability is near average (Z-score -0.16) and circadian amplitude is typical (Z-score 0.05), the combination of elevated RHR and IV points towards a generalized state of physiological activation. Hourly heart rate data further supports this, showing typical daily fluctuations but with notable drops during sleep hours that, when viewed across the population, are associated with higher perceived stress. This may suggest a more pronounced physiological recovery response needed after days of elevated stress, or that even deeper drops in heart rate during sleep are not fully restorative in the context of high perceived stress.

In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant engages in consistent physical activity, particularly exercising alone (Z-score 1.07, three times a week or more), which, while generally beneficial, shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress in this population, potentially indicating exercise as a coping mechanism in response to stress. Other recreational habits include substantial time spent listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and reading (Z-score 1.30). Notably, reading shows a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.22), suggesting it may serve as an effective, adaptive coping strategy for this individual. Engagement in passive leisure activities such as watching TV or playing video games is low. Substance usage is minimal across all categories. Health satisfaction is above average (Z-score 0.72), which might reflect a focus on maintaining physical health despite psychological challenges, though it has a weak negative correlation with PSS.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents substantial evidence for a high perceived stress level. The most compelling indicators include the exceptionally high CES-D score (Z-score 2.05), classifying depressive symptoms as significant, and the extremely elevated PSQI score (Z-score 3.83), indicating severe subjective sleep disturbance. Both metrics are strongly and positively associated with perceived stress. Furthermore, elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.56) and very low self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) consistently point to a high psychological distress burden. Physiologically, the slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.65) and above-average intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score 0.81) suggest chronic physiological arousal, which is commonly associated with higher stress. The correlation patterns for several of these key indicators (e.g., CES-D, STAI, happiness, RHR, IV) align with the observed Z-scores to support higher perceived stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score is notably weaker and less numerous. The participant exhibits above-average sleep duration (Z-score 1.22) and lower variability in sleep duration (Z-score -0.92), with the latter correlating positively with PSS (meaning lower variability is linked to lower PSS). High engagement in reading (Z-score 1.30), which is negatively correlated with PSS, suggests an adaptive coping behavior. Additionally, self-reported health satisfaction is above average (Z-score 0.72), although its correlation with PSS is weak. While these factors may offer some protective effects or indicate areas of adaptive functioning, they do not collectively outweigh the strong indicators of distress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the data, the overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a high perceived stress level. The significant distress indicated by the CES-D, PSQI, STAI, and low happiness scores forms a robust foundation for this conclusion. These are primary measures of psychological well-being and consistently show the participant at the higher end of the distress spectrum relative to the population. This psychological state is further corroborated by physiological markers of elevated arousal (RHR, IV). While the participant demonstrates some potentially stress-reducing behaviors like consistent sleep duration and frequent reading, these appear insufficient to offset the profound subjective distress and physiological dysregulation. Therefore, based on the magnitude and consistency of the psychological and physiological indicators of distress, it is highly probable that the participant’s PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

This participant generally reports below-average levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, with CES-D and STAI scores (Z-scores -0.24 and -0.23, respectively) classified as 'not depressed' and 'not anxious'. These low scores are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting a tendency towards lower perceived stress. However, self-reported happiness and self-esteem are slightly below the population mean (Z-scores -0.53 and -0.45), and these measures are negatively correlated with PSS, implying a potential for higher perceived stress given lower scores. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.37). Conversely, trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score 0.18). Overall, while core mental health symptomology appears well-managed, there are indications of mild subjective dissatisfaction with general well-being.

Objectively, the participant exhibits a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 8 minutes, significantly longer than the study population average (Z-score 1.18). Sleep start times are relatively consistent, with a standard deviation of 74 minutes, slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.19). This consistency in sleep timing is generally favorable. However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, while commonly indicating 'Disturbed Sleep,' is slightly below the study population's average (Z-score -0.33), suggesting that the subjective experience of sleep disturbance is not more pronounced than that of their peers. This participant also reports significantly more daily napping than the average (Z-score 1.27). The positive correlation between PSQI and napping with PSS suggests that despite long objective sleep, subjective sleep issues and napping could be associated with elevated stress.

The participant's physiological profile indicates a low resting heart rate (52.3 bpm, Z-score -0.7), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness or dominant parasympathetic tone. Circadian rhythm parameters derived from heart rate data show a somewhat stable interdaily rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 0.17) and slightly less intraday variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score -0.25). The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 4:00 PM. However, the 24-hour autocorrelation is notably low (Z-score -1.03), indicating less day-to-day predictability or rigidity in the heart rate rhythm compared to peers. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct periods of heightened physiological arousal. Specifically, heart rate is significantly elevated between 8-9 AM (Z-score 2.26) and also elevated between 10-11 AM (Z-score 1.14), 1-2 PM (Z-score 0.87), and 7-8 PM (Z-score 1.1). These patterns suggest substantial engagement or activity during these periods, particularly the morning peak.

Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent excellence with a GPA of 4.0 in recent semesters. Regarding substance use, alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor) is notably higher than the study average (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively), though recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise patterns are mixed: participation in individual or group exercise is below average, but engagement in sports is significantly higher than the population mean (Z-score 0.91), suggesting a preference for structured physical activity. Recreational habits show less time spent watching TV/videos and reading, but higher engagement in internet usage (Z-score 0.85).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analysis of the multimodal data provides evidence for both lower and higher perceived stress, as measured by the PSS.

Evidence supporting a PSS score in the **bottom 50%** of the study population includes the participant's below-average scores on the CES-D and STAI, indicating lower levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. These measures are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting that lower scores in these areas are associated with lower perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a notably low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.7), which is positively correlated with PSS, implying a lower physiological stress response. Objective sleep duration is significantly longer than the population average (Z-score 1.18), and longer sleep durations are weakly associated with lower PSS. The participant also engages in sports significantly more than peers (Z-score 0.91), which has a negative correlation with PSS, suggesting a protective effect against stress. Additionally, while classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates subjective sleep quality is actually better than the population average.

Conversely, some indicators suggest a PSS score in the **top 50%**. Self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and self-esteem (Z-score -0.45) are below average and negatively correlated with PSS, implying that lower scores in these areas are linked to higher perceived stress. The participant's 24-hour autocorrelation is significantly low (Z-score -1.03), and this measure has a negative correlation with PSS, suggesting that less predictable daily heart rate rhythms might be associated with higher stress. High daily napping (Z-score 1.27) is also positively correlated with PSS, potentially indicating a coping mechanism for perceived fatigue or suboptimal sleep quality. Elevated heart rate deviations observed during specific times, particularly the peak at 8-9 AM (Z-score 2.26), suggest periods of high physiological arousal that could be stress-related, although direct PSS correlations for these specific hourly deviations are weak. Higher alcohol consumption and internet usage are also noted, though their direct links to higher PSS are not strongly supported by the provided correlations.

Synthesizing this evidence, the participant's overall profile leans towards a PSS score in the lower half of the distribution. The strong indicators of lower psychological distress (CES-D, STAI) and robust physiological regulation (low resting heart rate) are significant. While there are some aspects of lower well-being (happiness, self-esteem) and less predictable physiological rhythms (autocorrelation), these do not outweigh the more direct measures of psychological and physiological resilience. The objective sleep patterns, high academic performance, and structured physical activity further contribute to a picture of effective functioning, despite subjective reports of sleep disturbance that are not worse than the population average.

17308,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a profile characterized by notable physiological regulation and structured behavioral patterns, particularly concerning sleep and physical activity, alongside a nuanced psychological landscape. Subjectively, the participant reports slightly above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8), suggesting a generally positive self-assessment of well-being. Academic performance, as indicated by a consistently high GPA (ranging from 3.68 to 3.72), is robust. However, some psychological indicators present a more complex picture; the participant reports slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17) and slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.17), while depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.14) are low, classifying them as not depressed.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical activities, exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), with others (Z-score 0.53), and participating in sports (Z-score 0.91) at frequencies well above the population average. This consistent physical activity is a significant positive health behavior. Conversely, engagement in several daily recreational activities, particularly internet usage (Z-score -1.83), socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96), is notably below the population average. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), is above average, indicating a higher frequency of use compared to peers.

Physiologically, the participant displays remarkable cardiovascular efficiency and sleep regularity. Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is significantly low (47.2 bpm, Z-score -1.3), and the overall average heart rate (Mesor) is also notably low (60.85 bpm, Z-score -1.79). This indicates a highly efficient cardiovascular system, often associated with good physical fitness and lower physiological stress. The circadian rhythm derived from heart rate data shows moderate to slightly below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.53), suggesting some day-to-day variability or a less rigidly entrained rhythm than average. However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score 0.15), indicating a robust daily swing between peak and trough heart rates. The hourly heart rate deviation from the Mesor reveals pronounced physiological arousal during specific daytime hours, with a significant peak in heart rate between 10-11 AM (Z-score 1.98), suggesting a period of high cardiovascular activity relative to their daily average.

Sleep patterns are exceptionally consistent and of good quality. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is notably good (Z-score -0.8), aligning with objective Fitbit data. The participant maintains a consistent sleep duration (median 7 hours 27 minutes, Z-score 0.33) with very low variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 64 minutes, Z-score -0.84) and sleep start time (standard deviation 36 minutes, Z-score -1.02). This high degree of sleep regularity and efficiency, coupled with an absence of napping (Z-score -0.86), underscores a well-disciplined and restorative sleep routine.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess whether the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, likely places them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution (where the median PSS is 22.0), we evaluate the collective evidence.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards lower perceived stress for this participant. Physiologically, their exceptionally low Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -1.3) and Mesor (Z-score -1.79) are strong indicators of a well-regulated and efficient cardiovascular system, typically associated with lower physiological and psychological stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits excellent sleep health, with a low PSQI score (Z-score -0.8) reflecting good subjective sleep quality. Objectively, Fitbit data confirms consistent and slightly above-average sleep duration (Z-score 0.33), crucially demonstrating very low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.84) and sleep start time (Z-score -1.02). Such sleep consistency is a powerful buffer against perceived stress. Behaviorally, high engagement in sports (Z-score 0.91, correlation with PSS -0.13) and lower time spent watching TV/videos (Z-score -0.62, weak positive correlation with PSS suggesting lower PSS) also align with reduced stress. Psychologically, above-average self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55, correlation with PSS -0.19) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8) further support a profile consistent with lower perceived stress. Even the slightly below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.14) contribute, albeit weakly, to a lower PSS.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, some indicators suggest a propensity for elevated perceived stress. The most prominent is the slightly above-average self-reported trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17), which has the strongest positive correlation with PSS (+0.31) among the psychological variables. Additionally, slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.17, correlation with PSS -0.15) could contribute to higher stress. Behavioral patterns reveal significantly lower engagement in certain recreational activities, such as video games (Z-score -0.56, correlation with PSS -0.14) and reading (Z-score -0.67, correlation with PSS -0.21), where lower engagement is associated with higher PSS. Reduced circadian rhythm stability, as indicated by moderately below-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.53, correlation with PSS -0.17) and interdaily stability (Z-score -0.33, correlation with PSS -0.12), could also be indicative of higher stress levels.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant reports slightly elevated trait anxiety and shows some behavioral patterns potentially linked to higher stress, the overwhelming evidence from robust physiological and sleep metrics strongly indicates a high degree of physiological resilience and well-being. The remarkably low Resting Heart Rate and Mesor, coupled with excellent subjective sleep quality and exceptional consistency in sleep patterns, represent powerful protective factors against perceived stress. These physiological strengths are substantial and likely mitigate the impact of the mild elevation in trait anxiety. The academic achievement (high GPA) also suggests effective coping mechanisms for academic stressors. Therefore, despite some indicators of underlying anxiety or less engagement in certain recreational activities, the overall profile is characterized by a strong physiological and behavioral foundation that would likely keep perceived stress at bay.

51851,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex interplay of strong psychological and behavioral strengths alongside notable challenges in sleep and physiological regulation. Psychologically, there is evidence of substantial resilience, as indicated by a high self-esteem score (Z=1.1) which is negatively correlated with perceived stress, and notably low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=-0.62). The participant also expresses significantly above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z=1.63). Behaviorally, a key strength is exceptional engagement in physical activity, with participation in exercise alone, with others, and in sports all reported at three or more times a week, corresponding to high positive Z-scores (1.07 to 1.58). Sports participation, in particular, demonstrates a negative correlation with perceived stress. While alcohol consumption is above the population average, engagement in recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreation patterns reflect a preference for active pursuits or music listening over sedentary screen-based activities, further supporting an active lifestyle. Academic performance is strong, with consistently high GPAs.

Despite these protective factors, significant vulnerabilities emerge within sleep quality and circadian rhythmicity. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z=0.59), indicating poorer sleep quality than the majority of the study population. Objective sleep data from wearables corroborate these concerns, showing an above-average variability in sleep start time (111 minutes, Z=0.61) and a late median sleep onset (00:56:09). Circadian rhythm metrics further underscore this dysregulation, with elevated Intradaily Variability (0.72, Z=1.23) suggesting a fragmented or less stable heart rate rhythm within days, and slightly reduced Interdaily Stability (0.32, Z=-0.74) indicating less day-to-day regularity. Both of these circadian measures have correlations consistent with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, hourly heart rate data reveals a significant elevation in physiological arousal late in the evening (10-11 PM deviation from mesor with a Z-score of 1.57), which is notably higher than the typical population pattern for this hour. This sustained late-evening arousal could actively impede the winding-down process and contribute to the reported difficulties in sleep quality and regularity.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates an exceptional level of cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a remarkably low resting heart rate (41.1 bpm, Z=-2.03) and a significantly below-average heart rate Mesor (60.05, Z=-1.9). These metrics are generally associated with a robust physiological capacity to manage stress and indicate excellent overall physical conditioning. The amplitude of the circadian heart rate rhythm is average, implying a normal range of daily physiological fluctuation. However, as noted previously, the pattern of hourly heart rate deviations indicates that while the participant is very fit, this fitness does not fully translate into an optimal sleep-wake cycle. The pronounced late-evening physiological activation, especially in the context of self-reported disturbed sleep and objective sleep variability, suggests that the body may struggle to adequately transition into a restorative state, potentially undermining the benefits of high cardiovascular fitness in managing daily stressors.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators typically associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-esteem is notably high (Z=1.1, negative correlation with PSS: -0.15), and they report very high satisfaction with their physical health (Z=1.63, negative correlation with PSS: -0.07). Crucially, measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=-0.62) are not elevated, suggesting a stable mental health baseline. From a behavioral perspective, the participant engages in an exceptionally high volume of physical activity across multiple domains (Z-scores up to 1.58), with sports participation negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12), which is a well-established buffer against stress. Physiologically, the resting heart rate (Z=-2.03) and heart rate Mesor (Z=-1.9) are remarkably low, indicating superior cardiovascular fitness, a factor often associated with enhanced stress resilience (Resting HR correlation with PSS: 0.14, implying lower RHR is linked to lower PSS). These factors collectively suggest a significant capacity for coping with stressors.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the aforementioned strengths, compelling evidence points towards elevated perceived stress. The most significant indicator is the self-reported disturbed sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z=0.59), placing the participant well above the population average for sleep disturbance. This is objectively reinforced by wearable data showing an above-average variability in sleep start time (Z=0.61) and an elevated Intradaily Variability (Z=1.23) in heart rate, which has a positive correlation with PSS (0.16). Additionally, the participant's Interdaily Stability (Z=-0.74) is below average, with a negative correlation with PSS (-0.12), suggesting less daily rhythm regularity is associated with higher stress. A particularly salient finding is the sustained and significantly elevated physiological arousal in the late evening (10-11 PM heart rate deviation Z=1.57). This persistent activation is likely to interfere with the natural winding down process, contributing to poor sleep and heightened subjective stress. While happiness is only slightly below average (Z=-0.53), its negative correlation with PSS (-0.19) suggests that this lower happiness could contribute to a higher perceived stress load.

**Holistic analysis:**
The participant presents a dichotomous profile: exceptional physical fitness and robust psychological defenses (high self-esteem, low anxiety/depression) on one hand, and significant, objectively verifiable sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances on the other. While high fitness and positive psychological traits typically reduce perceived stress, the profound and multifaceted issues with sleep quality, irregular sleep-wake patterns, and particularly the persistent late-evening physiological arousal are potent drivers of increased perceived stress. Chronic sleep deprivation and circadian dysregulation are well-known to impair emotional regulation, cognitive function, and the ability to cope with daily demands, directly contributing to feelings of being overwhelmed. Given that the population's 50th percentile PSS score is 22.0, the severity and pervasiveness of the sleep-related challenges and their documented links to perceived stress are likely to outweigh the protective factors. Therefore, despite being otherwise healthy and active, the participant's inability to achieve restorative sleep and maintain consistent physiological rhythms would likely result in an overall elevated experience of perceived stress.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile generally indicative of lower stress and robust well-being. Self-report measures reveal notably low levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.82) and depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = -0.24), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports significantly higher self-esteem (Z-score = 0.82), high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score = 0.97), and above-average trust in others (Z-score = 0.83). These positive self-perceptions and social orientations typically serve as protective factors against elevated stress. While self-reported happiness is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.53), this factor is weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress and is offset by the other strong positive indicators. In terms of behavioral habits, the participant engages in significantly more reading (Z-score = 1.3), an activity moderately negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting its potential role as a leisure or coping mechanism. Exercise frequency is moderately above average, and while beer consumption is higher than the population mean (Z-score = 1.01), its correlation with perceived stress is negligible.

Subjective and objective sleep data present a pattern of generally good sleep quality with specific characteristics. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score = -0.8), suggesting minimal sleep disturbance. This aligns with wearable data showing highly consistent sleep duration, as evidenced by a low standard deviation (Z-score = -0.84). However, the median total sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours and 50 minutes (Z-score = -0.44), and the median sleep start time is late, around 1:58 AM. Despite the late chronotype and slightly shorter duration, the regularity in sleep duration and the reported absence of napping (Z-score = -0.86) suggest a structured, albeit late, sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further support a stable physiological pattern, with very low intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.31), indicating a highly structured and regular daily activity-rest cycle. A robust circadian amplitude (Z-score = 0.75) and an acrophase around 5:58 PM signify a strong, well-defined daily rhythm in physiological activity.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals specific patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. The participant maintains an average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.04) across the study period. However, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during late evening and early morning, particularly between 11 PM and 1 AM (Z-scores of 1.85 and 1.63 respectively). These significant increases suggest heightened physiological arousal or activity during the period preceding or coinciding with the participant's late sleep onset. This late-night activation contrasts with a substantial decrease in heart rate deviation observed in the late morning, between 11 AM and 12 PM (Z-score = -1.69), indicating a period of significantly lower physiological activity or increased rest. These patterns suggest a physiologically robust individual with a pronounced circadian rhythm, but also a tendency for elevated late-night heart rate that may reflect late activity or physiological activation prior to sleep.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To assess whether the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the available evidence for both lower and higher stress levels in relation to the population median PSS score of 22.0.

Evidence suggesting a **low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile)** is substantial. The participant reports significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.82, positively correlated with PSS) and below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = -0.24, positively correlated with PSS). High self-esteem (Z-score = 0.82, negatively correlated with PSS), high health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.97, weakly negatively correlated with PSS), and above-average trust (Z-score = 0.83) are all indicators typically associated with lower perceived stress. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = -0.8). Objectively, highly consistent sleep duration (Fitbit Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.84) and a strong heart rate circadian amplitude (Z-score = 0.75, negatively correlated with PSS) point towards robust physiological regulation. Furthermore, very low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score = -1.31) suggests a stable daily rhythm, which generally contributes to lower stress, despite its weak positive correlation with PSS in this dataset. Engagement in reading (Z-score = 1.3), which has a moderate negative correlation with PSS, also supports lower stress.

Evidence that might suggest a **high PSS score (top 50th percentile)** is comparatively weaker. The participant's self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.53), which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS, but this alone is not a strong indicator. While the participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rate deviations during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 11 PM-1 AM, Z-scores of 1.85 and 1.63), indicating physiological arousal, the direct correlation of these specific hourly metrics with PSS is generally weak. This arousal could reflect late-night activities rather than purely stress-induced physiological hyperarousal. Median sleep duration is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.44), but its correlation with PSS is also very weak.

In conclusion, the overall body of evidence strongly supports the participant having a PSS score in the lower half of the study population distribution. The prominent indicators of low anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep quality, high health satisfaction, stable physiological rhythms, and engagement in stress-reducing activities significantly outweigh the minor or ambiguous factors that could suggest elevated stress.

72348,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant's psychological and behavioral profile presents a mixed pattern with several salient features indicating both resilience and potential vulnerabilities in the context of perceived stress.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a generally stable psychological trait profile, reporting below-average symptoms of depression (CESD score 6.0, Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI score 39.0, Z-score -0.23). These scores suggest a robust psychological state in these domains, with lower scores being moderately correlated with lower perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports slightly below-average self-esteem (score 34.0, Z-score -0.59) and current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), which are weakly associated with higher perceived stress. Academic performance is consistently high (GPA ranging from 3.6 to 3.93), indicating strong academic engagement, while satisfaction with physical health is above average (score 4.89, Z-score 0.47).

Behaviorally, the participant maintains very low levels of substance use across all categories, which generally aligns with positive health behaviors and a lack of reliance on maladaptive coping mechanisms. However, engagement in physical activity is notably low, with exercise frequencies ranging from ""1-2 times a month"" to ""not at all,"" corresponding to below-average Z-scores (e.g., Exercised with Others, Z-score -0.88). This limited physical activity could represent a behavioral vulnerability, as exercise is a known buffer against stress. Conversely, the participant reports significantly above-average engagement in sedentary recreational activities, including watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28), internet usage (Z-score 1.52), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41). High internet usage specifically shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress, potentially suggesting a less active coping style. A critical observation from self-reported data is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59), indicating subjectively ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a factor commonly associated with elevated perceived stress.

Physiological data from wearable sensors reveal a strong and highly regular heart rate-based circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits significantly above-average interdaily stability (value 0.65, Z-score 1.99) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (value 0.62, Z-score 2.49), coupled with below-average intradaily variability (value 0.43, Z-score -0.81). These metrics collectively point to a well-entrained and consistent daily physiological rhythm, which typically supports overall well-being. However, despite this underlying regularity, the participant's overall physiological arousal appears elevated, evidenced by a significantly high MESOR (86.31 bpm, Z-score 1.69) and, more notably, a substantially elevated resting heart rate (71.2 bpm, Z-score 1.55). This elevated baseline heart rate, which shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress, suggests a state of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity. The acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 3:25 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR indicates a very sharp and significantly above-average increase in heart rate during the morning (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score 1.5; 9-10 AM, Z-score 1.71), followed by a relatively less pronounced peak deviation in the afternoon compared to the population average (e.g., 3-4 PM, Z-score -0.97). This pattern suggests an intense physiological activation earlier in the day and a more rapid decline towards evening.

Objective sleep statistics from the wearable device present a contrasting picture to the self-reported sleep disturbance. The participant demonstrates notably high median sleep duration (8 hours 22 minutes, Z-score 1.48) and remarkable consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 39 minutes, Z-score -1.4) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 26 minutes, Z-score -1.24). These objective measures suggest highly consistent and adequate sleep quantity. Intriguingly, lower standard deviations in both sleep duration and start time show weak positive correlations with perceived stress, implying that while consistency is high, in this population, it is slightly associated with higher PSS. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) is also noted. The discrepancy between the participant's subjective experience of ""disturbed sleep"" (PSQI) and the objective evidence of long, consistent sleep points to a potential issue with sleep quality or restorative processes despite sufficient duration, which could be indicative of underlying stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Several significant indicators point towards an elevated level of perceived stress for this participant. Foremost among these are the physiological markers of heightened arousal: a substantially elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.55) and a high overall mean heart rate (MESOR Z-score 1.69), both suggesting chronic sympathetic activation. The pattern of hourly heart rate deviation, particularly the sharp and significantly above-average morning increase, further supports a state of physiological reactivity. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score 0.59), a strong correlate of perceived stress, despite objectively long and consistent sleep. This dissonance between objective and subjective sleep data often reflects a non-restorative sleep experience stemming from stress. Behaviorally, the consistently low engagement in exercise and high screen time, particularly internet usage (which weakly correlates with PSS), represent lifestyle choices that may not effectively mitigate stress. Furthermore, below-average self-esteem and happiness, though weakly correlated, can contribute to a higher perception of stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest a potentially lower or average perceived stress level. The participant's self-reported symptoms of depression (CESD Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23) are both below average and show moderate positive correlations with PSS, implying a reduced propensity for stress. The wearable data also reveals a highly robust and regular heart rate circadian rhythm, indicated by high interdaily stability, high 24-hour autocorrelation, and low intradaily variability. These features are generally associated with better physiological regulation and resilience to stress. Objective sleep duration is also notably high, providing ample time for rest. The minimal substance use and above-average health satisfaction contribute positively to overall well-being.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits lower levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology and demonstrates remarkably robust objective circadian rhythmicity and sleep consistency, the presence of significant physiological arousal (elevated resting heart rate and MESOR, sharp morning HR spike) and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI) are powerful indicators of elevated perceived stress. The discrepancy between objective sleep quantity/consistency and subjective sleep disturbance is particularly salient, suggesting that despite adequate sleep duration, the quality of rest may be compromised by stress. The participant's behavioral patterns, characterized by very low exercise and high sedentary screen time, also point to potential vulnerabilities in stress coping. Taken together, the strong physiological signature of chronic activation and the self-reported poor sleep quality, despite other positive indicators, suggest that the participant likely experiences an elevated level of perceived stress.

89607,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex psychological and physiological profile characterized by elevated internal distress coexisting with robust engagement in stress-buffering activities and consistent, albeit late, sleep patterns. Psychologically, there are notable indicators of distress: the participant's CES-D score (24.0, Z-score = 1.11) classifies them as experiencing depressive symptoms, and their STAI-Trait score (49.0, Z-score = 0.76) indicates elevated anxiety. Both of these measures show positive correlations with perceived stress (0.28 and 0.31 respectively), suggesting they are significant contributors or indicators of higher stress levels. Despite these elevations, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score = 0.55), which correlates negatively with perceived stress (-0.19), and self-esteem is slightly above the population average (Z-score = 0.26). Health satisfaction is close to the population mean. This juxtaposition suggests an individual who experiences significant psychological burden but also maintains positive emotional states and self-regard.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits several markers indicative of increased arousal. The resting heart rate is notably elevated (68.6 bpm, Z-score = 1.24), demonstrating a statistically significant deviation from the population mean, and this elevation positively correlates with perceived stress (0.14). The Mesor, representing the mean heart rate across the entire recording period, is also above average (80.34 bpm, Z-score = 0.87). Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveals a clear diurnal rhythm, with significant physiological dips during early morning hours (e.g., -14.85 bpm at 6-7 AM) indicative of a resting phase, and pronounced peaks during the early to mid-afternoon (e.g., 16.96 bpm at 1-2 PM, Z-score = 1.49). The acrophase, or the peak of the heart rate-based circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late at 5:14 PM, consistent with a later daily peak in physiological activity. While this pattern demonstrates a structured rhythm, the overall elevated baseline heart rate suggests a heightened state of general physiological arousal.

Sleep patterns combine subjective disturbance with objective consistency and extended duration. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep, although their Z-score (0.13) indicates this is not an extreme deviation within the study population. Objectively, the participant exhibits significantly longer-than-average median sleep duration (8 hours 12 minutes, Z-score = 1.26), and greater consistency in both sleep duration (Z-score = -0.81) and sleep start time (Z-score = -0.90) compared to peers. However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 2:02 AM, and the frequency of napping is significantly higher than average (Z-score = 1.27), correlating positively with perceived stress (0.14). Circadian rhythmicity, as measured by Interdaily Stability, is robust and above average (Z-score = 1.24), which generally signifies a consistent daily routine and negatively correlates with perceived stress (-0.11). The observed consistency in sleep timing, despite the late schedule, combined with frequent napping, suggests potential adaptations or compensatory behaviors in response to underlying physiological or psychological demands.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement across several activities, many of which are typically associated with stress reduction. They report significantly above-average participation in exercise, both alone (Z-score = 1.07) and with others (Z-score = 1.23), and notably high engagement in sports (Z-score = 1.58). Engagement in sports exhibits a negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.12), indicating a potential stress-buffering effect. Similarly, the participant reports very high engagement in leisure activities such as video gaming (Z-score = 1.71) and reading (Z-score = 1.30), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.14 and -0.21, respectively). These activities, alongside above-average engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score = 1.41), appear to be significant components of the participant’s daily routine, potentially serving as effective coping mechanisms against stress. Alcohol consumption involves wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.94), while other substance use is reported as absent.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

The participant exhibits several strong indicators suggestive of a PSS score in the top half of the study population. Foremost, the self-reported psychological measures are particularly salient: the participant's CES-D score is classified as ""Depressed"" (Z-score = 1.11), and their STAI score is classified as ""anxious"" (Z-score = 0.76). Both of these instruments are designed to capture distress, and crucially, they show positive correlations with PSS scores (0.28 for CES-D, 0.31 for STAI), implying a direct association with higher perceived stress. Physiologically, an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score = 1.24) and higher mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score = 0.87), both positively correlated with PSS, suggest a heightened state of physiological arousal often accompanying stress. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7.0) and significantly more frequent napping (Z-score = 1.27), with napping positively correlating with PSS (0.14), which could indicate a compensatory response to inadequate restorative sleep or fatigue related to stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Conversely, there is considerable evidence that might contribute to a lower or more moderate PSS score. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score = 0.55) and self-esteem (Z-score = 0.26), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19 and -0.15, respectively), suggesting internal protective factors. Behaviorally, the participant is highly engaged in several activities known to be stress-buffering, such as sports (Z-score = 1.58, PSS correlation = -0.12), video gaming (Z-score = 1.71, PSS correlation = -0.14), and particularly reading (Z-score = 1.30, PSS correlation = -0.21). These strong negative correlations suggest that these activities significantly mitigate perceived stress. Objective sleep data indicate a longer median sleep duration (Z-score = 1.26) and greater consistency in sleep duration (Z-score = -0.81) and sleep start time (Z-score = -0.90), alongside high interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.24), which generally points to a more structured and potentially restorative sleep-wake cycle. The interdaily stability also negatively correlates with PSS (-0.11).

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant demonstrates strong behavioral coping mechanisms and some positive psychological traits (happiness, self-esteem), the presence of clinically relevant levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with elevated physiological arousal (resting heart rate), are powerful indicators of elevated perceived stress. These symptoms are not merely statistically deviant but reach a classification threshold and are strongly positively correlated with PSS. The consistent and prolonged engagement in stress-buffering activities, while effective in mitigating some aspects of stress, may also be a compensatory response to an inherently higher baseline level of distress. The objectively stable, yet late, sleep schedule and increased napping, despite contributing to adequate sleep duration, could still be indicative of a lifestyle that, though consistent, is out of sync with typical demands or is itself a mechanism to manage fatigue potentially related to chronic stress. Therefore, considering the combined weight of significant psychological distress symptoms and physiological arousal, it is most probable that the participant experiences a higher level of perceived stress relative to their peers.

59900,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"The following analysis interprets the provided psychological and behavioral data to evaluate the participant's perceived stress levels and overall psychological state.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile, characterized by significant discrepancies between self-reported psychological well-being and objective behavioral and physiological indicators. Self-report measures generally suggest a relatively stable emotional state: the participant's CESD score (Z-score -0.03) indicates average levels of depressive symptoms, while the STAI score (Z-score -0.43) places their trait anxiety below the population average. Self-esteem is average (Z-score 0.11), and reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) is above the mean. Academic performance, as reflected by consistently strong GPAs (3.75, 3.26, 3.7), also suggests academic competence rather than distress in this domain. Health satisfaction, however, is notably below average (Z-score -1.2), indicating a potential area of concern, albeit with a weak correlation to perceived stress.

In stark contrast to the self-reported mental health indicators, the participant exhibits profound disturbances in sleep patterns. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 14.0, corresponding to an exceptionally high Z-score of 3.37, firmly classifies their subjective sleep quality as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This severe self-reported sleep impairment is corroborated by wearable data: median sleep duration is an unusually long 9 hours and 22 minutes (Z-score 2.71), suggesting potential hypersomnia or excessive time in bed. Critically, both sleep duration (standard deviation of 169 minutes, Z-score 1.55) and sleep start times (standard deviation of 137 minutes, Z-score 1.19) are highly variable across days. These metrics collectively indicate a highly inconsistent and dysregulated sleep schedule, which is a common correlate of elevated stress and poor sleep health, regardless of total duration. The participant reports no napping behavior (Z-score -0.86).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a near-complete absence of physical activity, reporting ""Not at all"" for exercising alone (Z-score -1.93), exercising with others (Z-score -1.58), and sports (Z-score -1.09). This severe lack of exercise represents a significant deviation from population norms and eliminates a widely recognized buffer against stress. Concurrently, substance use is elevated, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported ""1-2 times a week,"" correlating to Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94, respectively. While these behaviors show weak correlations with perceived stress in this dataset, they could potentially reflect coping mechanisms or habits that do not contribute to overall well-being. Daily recreational habits are mixed, with average engagement in TV/movies and socializing but below-average engagement in activities like video games, internet usage, music listening, and reading, particularly notable for reading which holds a moderate negative correlation with PSS.

Physiological data derived from heart rate further reveal signs of circadian rhythm disruption. The participant exhibits lower-than-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.74), Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.29), and Amplitude (Z-score -0.81), alongside lower Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.16). These metrics collectively indicate a less robust, less regular, and blunted heart rate-based circadian rhythm, signifying reduced consistency in daily physiological patterns and diminished dynamic range between peak and trough heart rate. This pattern of dampened and irregular rhythms is often associated with increased physiological strain and poorer adaptation to stressors. The Mesor (mean heart rate) and Resting Heart Rate are both near population averages. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor shows a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rate dropping significantly below the Mesor during early morning hours (e.g., -15.19 at 6-7 AM) and rising above the Mesor during daytime and early evening hours, peaking around mid-day (e.g., 10.32 at 1-2 PM) and late afternoon (10.15 at 4-5 PM). The Acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 4:37 PM, which is within a typical range. However, the blunted amplitude across the entire recording period suggests a reduced physiological responsiveness despite maintaining the general shape of the rhythm.

In summary, while the participant self-reports generally positive or average mental health symptomology, this is markedly contradicted by severe and pervasive sleep disturbances, a significant lack of physical activity, and objective markers of a dysregulated circadian system. These latter aspects represent substantial deviations from healthy behavioral and physiological norms and are strong indicators of a system under strain.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is substantial and multifaceted, primarily stemming from objective and indirect self-report measures. The most compelling indicator is the exceptionally high PSQI score (Z-score 3.37), signifying severe subjective sleep disturbance, which is strongly linked to elevated perceived stress. This is further reinforced by wearable sleep metrics showing high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 1.55) and sleep start times (Z-score 1.19), patterns that frequently accompany stress and poor sleep health. The participant's almost complete lack of engagement in any form of physical activity (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93) removes a critical stress-coping mechanism and is a significant risk factor for higher stress. Furthermore, several circadian rhythm metrics from wearable data—including lower Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.74), lower Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.16), lower Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.29), and a blunted Amplitude (Z-score -0.81)—collectively point to a less robust and more disrupted physiological rhythm, a common physiological manifestation of chronic stress. Elevated substance use (beer and wine/liquor) could also be a coping behavior, although the correlation to PSS is weak.

Conversely, evidence supporting a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is primarily derived from self-reported psychological trait measures. The participant reports average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.03) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43). Additionally, self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55), and self-esteem is average (Z-score 0.11). These self-reported measures suggest a certain degree of emotional resilience or a lack of overt psychological distress symptoms. Consistent strong academic performance (GPA) might also mitigate academic-related stress.

Upon holistic analysis, the compelling and consistent evidence for severe sleep disturbance (both subjective and objective), profound physical inactivity, and disrupted physiological rhythms significantly outweighs the self-reported absence of anxiety and depression symptoms. While the participant may not consciously report high levels of these specific symptoms, the widespread and pronounced dysregulation in fundamental behavioral and physiological domains (sleep, activity, circadian rhythm) is a powerful predictor of elevated perceived stress. The sheer magnitude of the PSQI Z-score (3.37) is particularly indicative. Therefore, despite the favorable self-reported emotional traits, the overall picture strongly suggests that the participant is likely experiencing a high level of perceived stress.

28254,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a generally resilient psychological profile based on self-report measures, exhibiting notably lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.92). Both of these psychological traits correlate positively with perceived stress, indicating that the participant's lower scores in these areas are associated with reduced stress. Additionally, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55), factors that typically serve as protective buffers against heightened stress. However, self-reported happiness is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.53), which negatively correlates with perceived stress and suggests a potential, albeit minor, contributor to overall stress levels.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports slightly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), positioning them above the population mean for sleep difficulties. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 45 minutes, which is somewhat shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.53). Despite this shorter duration, the participant exhibits significantly less day-to-day variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation Z-score -1.26), a factor positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that greater consistency in sleep quantity is associated with lower stress. In contrast, the timing of sleep onset is highly inconsistent, with a notably higher-than-average standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score 0.86), which positively correlates with perceived stress. This indicates a pattern of consistent sleep duration achieved at variable starting times.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythms display characteristics associated with higher perceived stress. Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.07) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score -0.61) are both significantly below average, indicating a less stable and less predictable daily physiological rhythm. These metrics correlate negatively with perceived stress, thus lower values suggest higher stress. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also below average (Z-score -0.78), implying less pronounced daily variation in physiological activity, which similarly correlates negatively with perceived stress. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.45), a parameter that positively correlates with perceived stress. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals relatively elevated heart rates during the late sleep and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, Z-score 1.81), suggesting increased physiological arousal during what is typically a restorative period. This pattern positively correlates with perceived stress. Conversely, the participant shows a rapid and pronounced decline in heart rate during the evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score -2.03; 10-11 PM, Z-score -2.22), indicating effective physiological winding down towards bedtime, a pattern that correlates negatively with perceived stress.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports higher-than-average consumption of both beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), though these specific habits show minimal correlation with perceived stress within this study population. Exercise frequency is generally consistent with population averages. Daily recreational habits are varied; notably, time spent reading is slightly above average (Z-score 0.32) and correlates negatively with perceived stress, while time socializing with friends is somewhat below average (Z-score -0.62). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, has remained robust across multiple semesters. Overall, while some behavioral patterns are notable, such as alcohol consumption, they do not present strong direct indicators of perceived stress based on the provided correlations.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits strong psychological protective factors against perceived stress. Self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.92) are significantly below the population average, and both correlate positively with PSS, meaning lower scores indicate lower perceived stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.26, correlation -0.15) and above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) also align with lower stress. Objectively, the participant demonstrates significantly lower variability in sleep duration (Z-score -1.26), which positively correlates with PSS, suggesting this consistency is linked to lower stress. Furthermore, a rapid and pronounced physiological wind-down during evening hours, reflected in significantly below-average heart rate deviations from the mesor (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score -2.03), correlates negatively with PSS, indicating a capacity for evening relaxation associated with lower stress. Less napping and higher reading frequency also weakly support lower PSS.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the positive psychological self-reports, several objective physiological and behavioral indicators suggest elevated perceived stress. The participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythms show significantly reduced stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score -1.07) and less pronounced daily variation (Amplitude Z-score -0.78), both of which correlate negatively with PSS, implying that these lower values are associated with higher stress. Similarly, lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.61) also points to higher stress. A slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.45) further supports higher stress, as it correlates positively with PSS. Critically, there is clear evidence of elevated physiological arousal during the late sleep and early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, Z-score 1.81), a pattern that strongly correlates with higher PSS. While sleep duration is consistent, the participant's sleep start time is highly variable (Z-score 0.86), which positively correlates with higher PSS. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z-score 0.13) and slightly below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.19) also contribute to the evidence for higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a complex profile with a notable dichotomy between self-reported psychological resilience and objective physiological and behavioral patterns. While the self-report data indicates low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are strong protective factors, the wearable-derived metrics point to significant challenges in physiological regulation and sleep consistency, particularly regarding circadian rhythm stability and sleep timing variability. The elevated heart rate during the latter half of the sleep period, coupled with the overall less stable and less robust daily heart rate rhythm, suggests a persistent underlying physiological stress response despite conscious psychological coping. These objective physiological disruptions, with several having substantial Z-scores and clear correlations to higher PSS, appear more pervasive and indicative of chronic strain than the subjective psychological strengths are indicative of low stress. Therefore, considering the convergence of multiple robust objective indicators pointing towards increased physiological and sleep-related stress, the participant is more likely to experience overall elevated perceived stress.

35347,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates a unique profile characterized by generally favorable psychological well-being, high academic performance, and distinct sleep and activity patterns, alongside specific physiological markers. Psychologically, the individual reports lower levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety than the study population, with a CESD Z-score of -0.34 and a STAI Z-score of -1.02, respectively. Both measures show a positive correlation with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), suggesting that these lower symptom burdens likely contribute to a reduced perception of stress. Furthermore, self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 0.96), which is negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a potential buffer against stress. Despite these strengths, self-reported happiness is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with PSS, implying a potential area of concern that could contribute to stress. Trust in others is significantly lower than average (Z-score -2.07), although its correlation with PSS is negligible. Academic performance, as indicated by a consistently high GPA (ranging from 3.74 to 3.77), suggests strong academic coping skills or a lower burden of academic stress.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a sedentary lifestyle with significantly less exercise than peers, as evidenced by negative Z-scores for both solo and group exercise and no participation in sports. While substance use is infrequent, recreational drug use is reported at a frequency higher than the population average (Z-score 1.61). Daily recreational habits include notably high internet usage (Z-score 2.19, positively correlated with PSS) and exceptionally high engagement in reading (Z-score 6.21, negatively correlated with PSS), alongside substantial socializing with friends (Z-score 1.74). The extensive reading habit, in particular, stands out as a potentially significant coping mechanism or a highly valued leisure activity associated with lower perceived stress.

Sleep patterns present a complex picture. Objectively measured sleep duration is significantly longer than the population average (median 8 hours 29 minutes, Z-score 1.61), which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS. However, there is considerable variability in sleep duration (standard deviation 146 minutes, Z-score 1.04), which correlates positively with PSS. The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:12 AM, though this late start time is relatively consistent, as indicated by a lower than average standard deviation (Z-score -0.6). The participant also reports a very high frequency of daily napping (Z-score 2.66), a behavior positively correlated with PSS, potentially indicating fragmented night-time sleep or a delayed sleep phase. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 6, which exceeds the common clinical threshold. However, relative to the study population, the PSQI Z-score of -0.33 suggests that this participant's sleep quality is slightly *better* than the average for the cohort.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveal a relatively well-regulated circadian rhythm, despite the atypical sleep schedule. The Interdaily Stability (IS) is slightly above average (Z-score 0.33) and negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting good regularity in the daily rhythm of activity and rest. The heart rate amplitude is also higher than average (Z-score 0.63) and negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a robust physiological response and recovery capacity. Intradaily Variability (IV) is average (Z-score 0.03) but positively correlated with PSS. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above average (Z-score 0.43), while the resting heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score -0.04). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight specific patterns: there are notably elevated heart rates in the early morning hours (12 AM - 2 AM, Z-scores 1.46 and 1.70), which is unusual for a period typically associated with deep sleep and may correspond to the participant's late sleep onset. Another significant elevation occurs in the early evening (6 PM - 7 PM, Z-score 1.75). These specific periods of physiological arousal, particularly in the pre-sleep window, could contribute to an overall sense of physiological activation or a disrupted sleep-wake cycle that might indirectly influence perceived stress.

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess whether the participant’s overall perceived stress level (as measured by the PSS domains) places them at the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, a holistic analysis of the presented evidence is required.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Several key indicators strongly suggest a lower-than-average perceived stress level. The participant exhibits significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.02) and below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.34), both of which have positive correlations with PSS, meaning lower scores on these measures are associated with lower stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), which is negatively correlated with PSS, serves as a protective factor. Furthermore, the participant engages in an exceptionally high amount of reading (Z-score 6.21), a habit negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting it may be a strong stress-buffering activity. Objectively measured sleep duration is significantly longer than average (Z-score 1.61) and weakly negatively correlated with PSS. Physiological indicators also lean towards lower stress, with higher interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.63) both being negatively correlated with PSS, reflecting greater physiological regularity and adaptability. Despite a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep, the Z-score (-0.33) suggests this participant's subjective sleep quality is actually better than the population average, implying the population as a whole may experience significant sleep issues.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Some factors suggest potential contributions to perceived stress. Self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with PSS, indicating lower happiness is linked to higher stress. Behavioral patterns such as high internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and frequent napping (Z-score 2.66) are positively correlated with PSS. Significant variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.04), also positively correlated with PSS, points to potential challenges in sleep consistency. The very late median sleep start time (02:12 AM) combined with elevated heart rates in the early morning hours (12 AM - 2 AM), which deviate significantly from the mesor, could indicate a physiological state of arousal during a typical rest period, potentially contributing to fatigue or stress. A generally sedentary lifestyle (low exercise) might also reduce a known stress-coping mechanism.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

When considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's profile presents a compelling case for a PSS score in the bottom half of the study population. The psychological indicators (STAI, CESD, Self-Esteem) are strongly protective against perceived stress, demonstrating significantly lower anxiety and depressive symptoms and higher self-worth than peers, all strongly linked to lower PSS. The exceptionally high engagement in reading, a behavior negatively correlated with PSS, further reinforces the presence of an effective coping mechanism. While the participant exhibits an atypical sleep schedule with late onset, high napping frequency, and sleep duration variability, the overall subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score) is not worse than the population average, and the individual benefits from a longer total sleep duration. Furthermore, the physiological data related to circadian rhythm regularity (Interdaily Stability) and cardiovascular robustness (Amplitude) suggest a well-regulated system generally associated with lower stress. The specific instances of elevated hourly heart rate in the early morning, while notable, are interpreted within the context of a consistent late sleep start time rather than pervasive dysregulation across the entire 24-hour cycle. The strong protective psychological and behavioral factors appear to outweigh the potential stressors arising from less optimal sleep architecture and certain activity patterns, leading to a conclusion of comparatively lower perceived stress.

45641,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant's data offers a multimodal view into their psychological state, behavioral habits, sleep patterns, and physiological regulation, providing insights into potential contributors to perceived stress.

**Psychological State and Well-being:**
The self-report data suggest an elevated psychological burden. The participant reported a CESD score of 22.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 0.9, placing them in the ""Depressed"" classification and indicating a higher burden of depressive symptoms relative to the study population. This measure shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.28). Similarly, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is elevated with a score of 46.0 (Z-score 0.46), classified as ""anxious,"" and also demonstrates a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.31). Conversely, the participant's self-esteem (RSES score 32.0, Z-score -0.87) is below the population average, which typically correlates negatively with PSS (-0.15), suggesting that lower self-esteem may contribute to higher perceived stress. Subjective happiness (Z-score -0.53) is also below average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19). Furthermore, health satisfaction (Z-score -1.45) is notably low, indicating significant dissatisfaction with physical health. These psychological indicators collectively point towards a profile characterized by increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and diminished well-being.

**Behavioral Habits and Lifestyle:**
Academically, the participant experienced a decline in GPA from 3.65 in Fall 2015 to 3.29 in Spring 2016, which could represent an academic stressor. Lifestyle behaviors reveal a generally low engagement with health-promoting activities. Substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as low or non-existent, indicating a potentially protective factor against substance-related stress. However, exercise frequency is notably low across all categories (exercising alone, with others, and sports), with significantly negative Z-scores, which often correlates with higher stress as physical activity is a known stress buffer. Recreational habits include above-average engagement in screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64), playing video games (Z-score 0.96), and internet usage (Z-score 0.85). Conversely, socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) is considerably below average, indicating a potential lack of social support, a crucial buffer against stress. Reading is also reported as ""do not do"" (Z-score -0.67), while time spent on sedentary hobbies is very high (Z-score 2.01). This pattern suggests a largely sedentary lifestyle with limited social interaction and physical activity.

**Sleep Patterns:**
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates disturbed sleep, consistent with the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, and generally signifies poorer sleep quality. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score 0.89), which is above the population average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.05), suggesting this aspect might be a protective factor. The variability in sleep duration is average (Z-score -0.02). The median sleep start time is late (01:59:30), but the variability in sleep start time is low (Z-score -0.73), which positively correlates with PSS (0.17), implying that a consistent, albeit late, sleep onset might be associated with lower PSS. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86), which also positively correlates with PSS (0.14), suggesting fewer naps are associated with lower PSS. Overall, while sleep duration is adequate and sleep timing is regular, the subjective experience of disturbed sleep (PSQI) suggests that sleep quality may still be compromised.

**Physiological Regulation (Circadian Rhythm and Heart Rate):**
The participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythm demonstrates several indicators of stability. Interdaily stability (Z-score 1.41) is notably high, indicating consistent day-to-day rhythmicity, and is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12), suggesting a potentially lower stress level. Intradaily variability (Z-score -0.53) is below average, implying less erratic heart rate fluctuations within the day, which, with a positive correlation with PSS (0.16), also points towards potentially lower PSS. Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.81) and amplitude (Z-score 0.81) are both above average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.17), further supporting a robust and well-defined circadian rhythm, which typically relates to better physiological regulation and lower stress. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (80.02 bpm, Z-score 0.83) and positively correlated with PSS (0.06), suggesting a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activity. The acrophase (peak HR) occurs in the late afternoon at 5:58 PM. Resting heart rate (63.2 bpm, Z-score 0.6) is slightly elevated compared to peers and positively correlated with PSS (0.14), aligning with the higher Mesor and suggesting a baseline of mild cardiovascular arousal that could be associated with elevated stress.

**Hourly Heart Rate Patterns:**
Analysis of aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., -22.32 bpm at 5-6 AM, Z-score -0.58), consistent with a sleep/rest period. Heart rate increases through the day, with significant elevations observed in the late evening. Notably, the heart rate deviation between 9-10 PM is 18.5 bpm (Z-score 1.83), which is a substantial elevation above the population average for that hour. This indicates a period of significantly increased physiological arousal late into the evening, which could disrupt the body's natural wind-down process before sleep. While the correlations for specific hourly deviations with PSS vary and are often weak or negative, the magnitude of this late-evening elevation in heart rate is physiologically salient, indicating sustained cardiovascular activity during a time when physiological relaxation would typically be expected. This elevated arousal could contribute to or be a manifestation of perceived stress.

**Overall PSS Score Ranking:**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits a pattern of psychological distress and behavioral factors that strongly align with elevated perceived stress. They report significantly higher depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.9) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46), both positively correlated with PSS. Lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.87) and reduced happiness (Z-score -0.53), which are negatively correlated with PSS, further contribute to a profile indicative of higher stress. Subjective health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score -1.45). Behaviorally, the participant engages in very low levels of exercise and significantly reduced social interaction (Socializing Z-score -1.41), both of which are critical buffers against stress. A declining GPA may also serve as an additional stressor. Physiologically, the resting heart rate (Z-score 0.6) and Mesor (Z-score 0.83) are slightly elevated, with positive correlations to PSS. Crucially, the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced elevation in cardiovascular activity in the late evening (9-10 PM, Z-score 1.83), suggesting sustained physiological arousal during a period typically associated with winding down. The self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7.0) also points to a compromised restorative process.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Counterbalancing these indicators are several factors suggesting lower stress. The participant's circadian rhythm metrics (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.41, Intradaily Variability Z-score -0.53, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 0.81, Amplitude Z-score 0.81) generally point towards a robust and regular physiological rhythm. Higher stability and amplitude, and lower variability, are typically associated with better health and lower stress, and their respective correlations with PSS suggest these contribute to lower perceived stress. Objective sleep data indicates adequate median sleep duration (Z-score 0.89) and low variability in sleep start time (Z-score -0.73), both of which are associated with lower PSS. Furthermore, the participant reports very low substance usage across all categories, which can be a protective factor against maladaptive coping mechanisms for stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates several strengths in physiological regularity (circadian rhythm) and objective sleep patterns (duration, consistency), alongside low substance use, these factors appear insufficient to mitigate the substantial burden indicated by the self-reported psychological measures and key behavioral deficiencies. The elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, low self-esteem, reduced happiness, and particularly the very limited social engagement and lack of physical activity present a strong case for elevated perceived stress. The objective physiological marker of significantly elevated heart rate in the late evening further supports a state of heightened arousal. Given the confluence of significant psychological distress, unsupportive behavioral patterns, and physiological indicators of arousal, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely elevated relative to their peers.

64572,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally favorable psychological profile characterized by low self-reported depressive and anxious symptomology, alongside elevated self-esteem and trust levels. Specifically, scores on the CES-D (Z-score -0.97) and STAI-Trait (Z-score -0.62) are well below the population average, indicating an absence of significant depressive or anxious proneness, both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score 0.54) and trust (Z-score 0.83) are notably higher than average, representing protective psychological factors often associated with lower stress. Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates healthy lifestyle choices, reporting no substance usage (all Z-scores significantly negative) and engaging in above-average physical activity, particularly in sports (Z-score 0.91) and individual exercise (Z-score 0.32). Recreational habits, such as video gaming (Z-score 0.96) and reading (Z-score 0.32), are also engaged in at an above-average frequency, with these activities showing modest negative correlations with perceived stress in the study population.

Physiologically, the participant displays remarkable circadian rhythm regularity and robust cardiovascular health. Wearable data indicate significantly higher-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score 1.66) and a robust heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.49), coupled with average intraday variability (Z-score -0.11) and positive autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.39). These metrics collectively suggest a highly consistent and well-entrained physiological rhythm, which is typically associated with lower chronic stress and better health outcomes. Furthermore, the participant's resting heart rate (50.3 bpm, Z-score -0.93) and mesor (mean heart rate, 67.23, Z-score -0.92) are notably lower than the population average, indicating superior cardiovascular fitness and a baseline state of low physiological arousal.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.69). While the PSQI score of 6.0 classifies sleep as ""disturbed,"" the associated Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their subjective sleep quality is, in fact, better than the average study participant. Crucially, the participant maintains a highly consistent sleep schedule, evidenced by a lower-than-average standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score -0.61), reinforcing the robust circadian rhythm observed in other physiological metrics. However, an examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of significantly elevated physiological arousal during the evening hours. Specifically, heart rate deviations reach their highest points between 7 PM and 10 PM, with Z-scores peaking at 2.47 for the 8-9 PM period and remaining notably high during these hours. Although the population-level correlations suggest that higher heart rate during these specific periods is associated with lower perceived stress, for this individual, it represents a pronounced and sustained state of physiological activity during hours that typically involve winding down. This may reflect engagement in vigorous evening activities such as sports, given the self-reported high frequency of participation, rather than distress. Minor areas for consideration include slightly below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.45).

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents compelling evidence for a perceived stress level in the bottom half of the study population. Psychologically, their very low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62) are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. This is further bolstered by above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.54) and trust (Z-score 0.83), which act as protective factors. Physiologically, the data show an exceptionally healthy profile: a remarkably low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.93) and mesor (Z-score -0.92), alongside highly regular and robust circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.66, Amplitude Z-score 0.49). These are strong indicators of physiological resilience and low chronic stress. Behaviorally, the participant refrains from substance use (all Z-scores significantly negative) and engages in above-average physical activity and recreational habits (e.g., sports, video games, reading), many of which are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting they serve as effective stress reducers. Despite a classification of ""disturbed sleep,"" the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates better subjective sleep quality than the average student, and their consistent sleep start times further support a stable sleep-wake cycle.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a high perceived stress score is notably limited. The participant reports slightly lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.45), which typically show negative correlations with perceived stress. Additionally, their median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes is shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.69), and insufficient sleep is often linked to higher stress. While the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals significantly elevated physiological arousal during evening hours (particularly 7-10 PM, with Z-scores up to 2.47), which could be a source of perceived strain for some individuals, the accompanying population correlations for these specific peaks are *negative* with PSS. This counterintuitive finding suggests that, for this study population, higher evening heart rates might be associated with active leisure or productive engagement rather than distress, especially given the participant's high engagement in sports. Therefore, this physiological pattern does not strongly indicate elevated stress in this context.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the multimodal data, the overwhelming evidence points towards a participant with relatively low or average perceived stress. The strong psychological protective factors (low anxiety, low depression, high self-esteem, high trust), combined with exceptional physiological markers of stress resilience (very low RHR, robust circadian rhythm regularity), significantly outweigh the minor indicators that might suggest higher stress (e.g., slightly lower happiness/health satisfaction, shorter sleep duration). The pronounced evening physiological arousal, while notable, is interpreted cautiously due to the negative correlation with PSS within the study population, suggesting it may reflect active engagement rather than distress. Therefore, the participant's overall perceived stress level is most likely within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

28312,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by significant trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance, coexisting with indicators of academic success and some aspects of robust physiological rhythmicity. The self-reported State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 48.0, with a Z-score of 0.66, categorizes the participant as anxious, indicating a stable individual predisposition to anxiety that moderately correlates with perceived stress. Concurrently, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) signifies clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, a factor frequently associated with heightened stress. Despite these challenges, the participant’s self-report on the CES-D scale for depressive symptoms is within the non-depressed range (Score 14.0, Z-score 0.07), and they maintain a high academic performance with GPAs consistently above 3.75, suggesting effective management of academic demands. Self-esteem is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.45), while reported happiness is somewhat above average (Z-score 0.55).

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors provides further insight into the participant’s state of arousal and daily rhythms. The participant exhibits a significantly elevated mean heart rate (Mesor of 83.44 bpm, Z-score 1.3) and a slightly higher resting heart rate of 61.7 bpm (Z-score 0.42) compared to the study population, indicating a generally increased baseline physiological activation. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also notably high (15.54, Z-score 1.54), suggesting a pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate, with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring around 5:32 PM. While this robust amplitude correlates negatively with PSS, potentially indicating a healthy physiological capacity for diurnal variation, the elevated baseline heart rate suggests an underlying state of heightened arousal. The hourly deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rates generally lower in the early morning and peaking significantly in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, deviation of 21.85, Z-score 1.65). Circadian rhythm metrics reveal above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and a high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.9), both suggesting a regular and consistent daily heart rate rhythm, which generally correlates negatively with perceived stress.

Regarding sleep patterns, a notable discrepancy exists between subjective experience and objective measures. The PSQI indicates poor sleep quality, yet Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score 0.51), which is slightly above the population average. However, this objectively adequate duration is accompanied by higher than average variability in sleep duration (123 minutes, Z-score 0.51), a factor that positively correlates with PSS. Conversely, the variability in sleep start time is below average (58 minutes, Z-score -0.54), indicating a relatively consistent bedtime. Lifestyle behaviors include low engagement in physical exercise, with participation in sports being ""Not at all"" (Z-score -1.09) and other forms of exercise occurring infrequently (Z-scores -0.43 and -0.17). The participant reports above-average consumption of beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), which, although showing weak correlations with PSS in this dataset, could represent a behavioral response to stress. Engagement in other daily recreational activities generally aligns with population averages.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

An evaluation of the participant’s overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, necessitates a comprehensive review of all available data, weighing both direct indicators of stress and potential mitigating factors.

Evidence strongly suggests the participant’s PSS score would place them in the top half of the study population distribution. The most compelling indicators are the participant's STAI score, which classifies them as ""anxious"" with a Z-score of 0.66, demonstrating an elevated predisposition to chronic anxiety that positively correlates with perceived stress. Additionally, the PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) points to significant subjective sleep disturbance, a well-established reciprocal relationship with stress. Physiologically, the notably elevated Mesor heart rate (Z-score 1.3) and slightly higher resting heart rate (Z-score 0.42) signify a state of chronic physiological arousal. Furthermore, the higher variability in objective sleep duration (Z-score 0.51), which correlates positively with PSS, indicates an inconsistency in a crucial restorative process. The low engagement in exercise, particularly sports (Z-score -1.09), removes a common and effective coping mechanism for stress.

Conversely, some factors suggest a PSS score in the bottom half or around the median. The participant does not report significant depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 0.07) and reports slightly above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55). Objectively, sleep duration is adequate (Z-score 0.51), and the variability in sleep start time is below average (Z-score -0.54), contributing to a more consistent sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data, such as above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.9), both correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting a well-structured physiological rhythm that could be protective. The high heart rate amplitude (Z-score 1.54), also negatively correlated with PSS, might reflect a robust physiological capacity for adapting to daily demands. The participant's high academic GPA indicates an ability to perform under academic pressure.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the predominant indicators of elevated trait anxiety (STAI), significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI), and chronic physiological arousal (Mesor heart rate) strongly suggest a higher level of perceived stress. While there are some protective factors, such as consistent sleep timing and robust circadian rhythmicity, these appear insufficient to fully offset the impact of the more direct and pronounced indicators of stress and anxiety. Therefore, the participant's perceived stress level is most likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

56805,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a robust profile of psychological well-being, characterized by notably low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 1.0, Z-score -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI score 20.0, Z-score -2.11). These scores are significantly below the population mean, suggesting a disposition towards emotional stability and resilience. Further supporting this positive psychological state are exceptionally high self-esteem (Score 50.0, Z-Score 1.66) and happiness levels (Current 5.0, Z-Score 1.64), alongside very high satisfaction with physical health (Score 7.0, Z-score 2.05). Academic performance is consistently strong, as evidenced by GPAs of 3.32 and 3.33. Lifestyle behaviors reinforce this adaptive pattern, with the participant reporting no substance usage and highly frequent engagement in exercise, particularly sports activities (Z-score 1.58), often in social settings. This combination of strong psychological resources and healthy active behaviors typically aligns with lower levels of perceived stress.

A notable discrepancy emerges in the participant's sleep patterns. While the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) indicates ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), objective wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of only 5 hours and 33 minutes, which is markedly short (Z-score -2.02) relative to the study population. The participant also exhibits a late median sleep start time of approximately 01:20 AM. Despite the short duration, the variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 75 minutes, Z-score -0.59) and sleep start time (standard deviation 54 minutes, Z-score -0.63) is near the population average, indicating a relatively consistent, albeit objectively brief, sleep schedule. The self-reported perception of good sleep, despite objectively short duration, could reflect an adaptive coping style or a lack of awareness regarding the physiological impact of insufficient sleep.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicates excellent cardiovascular fitness. The participant's resting heart rate is very low at 44.2 bpm (Z-score -1.66), and their overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is also below average (64.45 bpm, Z-score -1.3). The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a typical and healthy diurnal rhythm, with heart rate deviations significantly below the mesor during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -30.64 at 4-5 AM, Z-score -2.08) and elevated above the mesor during active daytime periods (e.g., 18.31 at 10-11 AM, Z-score 1.93). Regarding circadian rhythm regularity, the Interdaily Stability (0.3, Z-score -0.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.23, Z-score -0.78) are somewhat lower than the population average, suggesting a minor degree of day-to-day irregularity in their heart rate-based physiological rhythms. However, Intradaily Variability and Amplitude are within the average range, indicating a consistent daily rhythm structure despite some variability between days. These physiological markers, particularly the low resting heart rate and well-defined diurnal pattern, generally point towards a resilient physiological state that is typically associated with lower perceived stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

The participant exhibits a substantial collection of psychological and behavioral characteristics strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Their extremely low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.28, correlation 0.28 with PSS) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -2.11, correlation 0.31 with PSS) are compelling indicators of emotional resilience. High self-esteem (Z-score 1.66, correlation -0.15), happiness (Z-score 1.64, correlation -0.19), and health satisfaction (Z-score 2.05, correlation -0.08) further reinforce this profile, as these factors typically buffer against stress. Positive lifestyle choices, such as frequent engagement in exercise and sports (Z-score 1.58 for sports, correlation -0.13 with PSS) and the absence of substance use, also contribute to a lower stress propensity. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness with a very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.66, higher RHR correlates with higher PSS) and a low Mesor (Z-score -1.3, higher Mesor correlates with higher PSS), which are generally protective factors against stress. Crucially, the self-reported PSQI score indicates ""Good Sleep"" (Z-score -1.26), suggesting a subjective experience of adequate rest despite objective measurements.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

The primary evidence suggesting a potentially higher PSS score revolves around the participant's objective sleep metrics and aspects of circadian rhythm regularity. Despite self-reporting good sleep quality, the Fitbit data shows a significantly short median sleep duration of 5 hours and 33 minutes (Z-score -2.02), coupled with a late median sleep start time. While the correlation of sleep duration with PSS is minimal in this dataset (-0.05), chronically insufficient sleep can be a physiological stressor. Furthermore, the participant's Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.78) are somewhat below average, indicating a minor degree of irregularity in their heart rate-based circadian rhythms. These measures have negative correlations with PSS (-0.12 and -0.17 respectively), implying that lower regularity might be associated with higher perceived stress. Intradaily Variability is average, but higher variability is positively correlated with PSS (0.16).

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The overwhelming evidence points towards the participant experiencing a relatively low level of perceived stress. The depth and breadth of positive psychological attributes (exceptionally low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness) combined with beneficial health behaviors (frequent exercise, no substance use) and excellent physiological fitness (very low resting heart rate, low mesor) are powerful indicators that directly correlate with lower PSS. While the objective short sleep duration is a notable health concern, its direct correlation with PSS in this dataset is very small, and it is largely contradicted by the participant's self-perception of ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI), which itself aligns with lower stress. The minor irregularities in circadian rhythm, while present, are less influential compared to the robust indicators of psychological well-being and physiological resilience. Therefore, the participant’s PSS score is highly likely to fall into the lower half of the study population distribution.

26800,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant generally reports favorable psychological well-being and academic performance. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, are below the population average (score 7.0, Z-score -0.66), classifying the participant as ""Not depressed,"" which typically correlates with lower perceived stress. Academic performance is consistently strong, with GPAs above 3.8, suggesting competence and potentially reduced academic-related stress. Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 0.96), a trait weakly associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, is reported as ""Good Sleep"" (score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), further supporting a positive subjective well-being. Trait anxiety (STAI score 40.0, Z-score -0.13) is near the population average, indicating that while clinically categorized as ""anxious,"" this is not unusually high relative to peers. Health satisfaction and trust levels are also approximately average. However, a significant deviation is observed in self-reported happiness, which is lower than average (Z-score -0.53), a metric that moderately correlates with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns reveal a participant with specific recreational preferences and lower engagement in several common activities. While participation in sports is notably high (Z-score 0.91), and weakly associated with lower perceived stress, engagement in other forms of exercise, both alone (Z-score -1.18) and with others (Z-score -1.58), is significantly below average. Similarly, engagement in sedentary recreational activities such as watching TV/videos (Z-score -1.25), listening to music (Z-score -1.19), and reading (Z-score -0.67) is considerably low or absent. Importantly, the lack of engagement in reading is moderately associated with higher perceived stress. Internet usage and socializing with friends are within average ranges. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), is higher than average, though its correlation with perceived stress is negligible. This pattern suggests a selective engagement in physical activity balanced against a general low participation in various common leisure and relaxation activities, some of which are relevant to perceived stress.

Physiological data from wearables indicate a unique circadian profile and arousal patterns. The participant exhibits lower than average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and a reduced heart rate amplitude (Z-score -0.9), both weakly suggesting less robust and less pronounced day-to-day cardiovascular rhythms, and weakly correlating with higher perceived stress. Conversely, 24-hour autocorrelation is higher than average (Z-score 0.64), indicating a degree of regularity in daily patterns despite the lower stability. The resting heart rate is notably low (49.4 bpm, Z-score -1.04), generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, though paradoxically, this low RHR is weakly correlated with higher perceived stress in this dataset. An analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern: physiological arousal is significantly elevated in the late morning hours (9-10 AM: Z-score 2.2; 10-11 AM: Z-score 1.43), indicating a substantial surge in activity or physiological demand during this period. This contrasts with a subsequent and notably diminished physiological activity in the mid-to-late afternoon (3-4 PM: Z-score -1.23; 5-6 PM: Z-score -1.02), suggesting a pronounced midday peak followed by a marked dip in arousal.

Fitbit-derived sleep statistics corroborate some aspects of the self-reported good sleep quality, with an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score 0.06). However, the regularity of sleep patterns is less consistent. While sleep duration variability is close to average (Z-score -0.15), there is slightly above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.13), with a median start time of 01:28:38. Both higher sleep duration standard deviation and sleep start time standard deviation are weakly correlated with higher perceived stress, suggesting that while overall sleep duration is adequate, inconsistencies in the sleep schedule might contribute to stress. Napping frequency is average.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for PSS Score in the Bottom 50th Percentile:**
Several data points suggest the participant might experience relatively lower or average levels of perceived stress. Self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD score 7.0, Z-score -0.66) are below the population average, and this measure positively correlates with PSS (0.28), indicating a likely lower PSS score. The participant also exhibits high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), which is weakly associated with lower perceived stress (-0.15). Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as ""Good Sleep"" (Z-score -0.8), weakly correlating with lower PSS (-0.05). Furthermore, consistent high academic performance (GPA) throughout the semester could alleviate academic-related stress. Engagement in sports is notably high (Z-score 0.91), and this activity is weakly correlated with lower perceived stress (-0.13). In terms of physiological markers, a higher 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.64) suggests more regular daily patterns, weakly associated with lower PSS (-0.17). Average median sleep duration (Z-score 0.06) is also weakly associated with lower PSS (-0.05).

**Evidence for PSS Score in the Top 50th Percentile:**
Conversely, several factors indicate a propensity for higher perceived stress. The participant reports lower-than-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53), a metric that shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.19), implying that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. A notable behavioral pattern is the extremely low engagement in reading (""Do not do"", Z-score -0.67), which has the strongest negative correlation with PSS among the activity measures (-0.21), strongly suggesting that this lack of engagement is associated with higher perceived stress. Other leisure activities like watching TV/videos and listening to music are also significantly below average. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and reduced heart rate amplitude (Z-score -0.9), indicative of less robust and less pronounced circadian rhythms, both of which are weakly correlated with higher PSS (-0.12 and -0.17 respectively). While the resting heart rate is remarkably low (Z-score -1.04), which typically indicates fitness, it paradoxically shows a weak positive correlation with PSS (0.14) in this dataset, suggesting a unique physiological context. Sleep patterns, despite adequate duration, show slightly above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.13), weakly correlating with higher PSS (0.17). Finally, the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced physiological activation in the late morning (9-10 AM, Z-score 2.2), followed by a notable dip in the afternoon, potentially reflecting a highly demanding or taxing daily routine, even if direct PSS correlation for this specific metric is negligible.

**Holistic Assessment and Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates strong academic performance, good self-esteem, and low depressive symptoms, which are generally protective against stress, the cumulative evidence leans towards a higher perceived stress level. The moderate inverse correlations between PSS and both self-reported happiness (participant is less happy) and reading engagement (participant does not read) are particularly salient and are among the strongest guiding correlations in the dataset. These factors, combined with objective measures of less robust circadian rhythms (lower interdaily stability and amplitude), slightly less consistent sleep patterns, and the notable physiological arousal pattern during the day, suggest that despite certain strengths, the overall profile is more consistent with individuals experiencing higher levels of perceived stress within the study population.

47142,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by notable psychological distress, elevated physiological arousal, and a structured yet potentially insufficient sleep pattern, alongside specific lifestyle habits. Psychologically, the individual reports moderately elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score 19.0, Z-score 0.59) and slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 43.0, Z-score 0.17), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem (score 35.0, Z-score -0.45) and current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) are reported as below the study population average, with lower scores typically correlating with higher perceived stress. Academic performance shows a notable decline, with the GPA decreasing from 3.77 in Spring 2016 to 3.42 in Fall 2016, suggesting a significant academic stressor or period of difficulty.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a relatively isolated social life, reporting ""Not at all"" for exercising with others (Z-score -1.58) and engaging in socializing with friends for only ""16-30 minutes"" (Z-score -1.41), both significantly below the population average. This limited social engagement, coupled with minimal substance use, suggests either a lack of reliance on maladaptive coping mechanisms or a potentially reduced social support network, which can contribute to perceived stress. Engagement in solitary exercise (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.32) and reading (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32) are slightly above average, with reading showing a negative correlation with perceived stress, potentially serving as a coping mechanism.

Physiologically, the participant displays markers of elevated baseline arousal. The resting heart rate (65.1 bpm, Z-score 0.83) and the mesor (mean heart rate of 83.59 bpm, Z-score 1.32) are both above the population average and positively correlated with perceived stress, indicating a potentially heightened state of cardiovascular activity. Despite these elevations, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm demonstrates significant regularity, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.08), low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.31), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.48). These robust circadian markers, with some negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggest a stable physiological structure across days. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs at 5:06 PM, with hourly heart rate deviations showing sustained elevation above the mesor into the early evening, before the expected nightly decline.

Regarding sleep, there is a discrepancy between subjective and objective measures. The participant self-reports ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), which is significantly better than the population average and negatively correlated with perceived stress. However, objective Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 32 minutes (Z-score -0.81), which is below the population average. The median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:39:29. Notably, the participant engages in napping at a significantly higher frequency than the average (Mean Daily Naps Z-score 2.66). While sleep duration and start time variability are below average, indicating regularity in sleep schedule, the combination of shorter nocturnal sleep and frequent napping might suggest a degree of underlying sleep debt or fatigue that could contribute to perceived stress, despite positive subjective sleep quality.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence suggesting the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would likely place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is primarily derived from the cluster of self-reported psychological distress measures. The participant exhibits above-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.59) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17), both of which have positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31 respectively). Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score -0.45) and happiness (Z-score -0.53) are below average, and their negative correlations with PSS (-0.15 and -0.19) indicate that these lower scores contribute to higher perceived stress. Furthermore, the significant decline in GPA during the most recent academic semester serves as a tangible and potent external stressor. Physiologically, an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.83) and a higher heart rate mesor (Z-score 1.32), both positively correlated with PSS (0.14 and 0.06), suggest a heightened state of physiological arousal consistent with elevated stress. The significantly higher frequency of napping (Z-score 2.66), combined with objectively shorter nocturnal sleep, may also contribute to underlying fatigue and perceived stress, despite good subjective sleep quality.

Conversely, evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes the self-reported ""Good Sleep"" quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26), which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (-0.10). The participant also demonstrates robust heart rate circadian rhythmicity, with high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.08) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.48), both negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12 and -0.17 respectively). Lower intradaily variability (Z-score -1.31) and moderate amplitude (Z-score 0.31, correlation -0.17) also support a well-structured physiological rhythm, which is generally associated with better health outcomes and potentially lower stress. Engaging in reading (Z-score 0.32), which has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), also offers a mild protective factor.

Holistically, while the strong physiological regularity and excellent self-reported sleep quality are significant factors that would typically mitigate perceived stress, they appear to be outweighed by the direct and more influential indicators of psychological distress. The consistent pattern of elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, low self-esteem, and low happiness, coupled with a clear academic performance decline and sustained physiological arousal, points to a subjective experience of elevated stress. The discrepancy between objective shorter sleep and subjective good sleep, along with frequent napping, may indicate underlying fatigue not fully captured by the PSQI, contributing to overall perceived burden. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant likely experiences a higher level of perceived stress.

60396,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a mixed but generally adaptive psychological state. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are below the population average (Z-score = -0.55), classifying the participant as 'Not depressed'. However, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is slightly above the population mean (Z-score = 0.07), suggesting a degree of chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem, according to the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is below the population average (Z-score = -0.73). Despite these areas, the participant reports higher-than-average current happiness (Z-score = 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.88), alongside elevated trust in others (Z-score = 1.15). Academically, the participant exhibits a declining GPA trend over several semesters, which may indicate increasing academic pressure or challenges during the study period.

Sleep patterns, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, present a nuanced picture. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as having 'Disturbed Sleep', their Z-score of -0.33 indicates better subjective sleep quality than the average individual classified with disturbed sleep in the study population. Objective Fitbit data largely support a consistent sleep schedule: median sleep duration is slightly above average at 7 hours and 23 minutes (Z-score = 0.26), with notably low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score = -0.69) and sleep start time (Z-score = -0.66). The median sleep start time is relatively late at 1:46 AM, yet its consistency suggests a stable, albeit shifted, sleep-wake schedule.

Lifestyle behaviors are characterized by moderate social engagement in physical activity and elevated alcohol consumption. The participant engages in exercise with others three or more times a week (Z-score = 1.23), which is significantly above the population average, and also exercises alone 1-2 times a week. Substance use includes above-average consumption of beer (Z-score = 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Recreational habits indicate above-average video game engagement (Z-score = 0.96) but lower engagement in activities such as internet usage (Z-score = -1.16), listening to music (Z-score = -1.19), reading (Z-score = -0.67), and socializing with friends (Z-score = -0.62) compared to the population average.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits robust cardiovascular fitness and a highly regular circadian rhythm. Resting heart rate (RHR) is significantly low at 49.4 bpm (Z-score = -1.04), and the heart rate MESOR (mean HR) is also notably low (Z-score = -1.11), both indicative of excellent cardiovascular health. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show a high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = 1.57) and very low intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.45), suggesting an exceptionally stable and well-entrained daily heart rate rhythm with minimal fragmentation. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.24), and amplitude is slightly lower than the mean (Z-score = -0.2). The heart rate acrophase is observed at 5:52 PM. Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations from the MESOR confirm a clear diurnal pattern, with the lowest heart rates occurring during the early morning sleep hours (e.g., -24.02 deviation from 5-6 AM) and peaking significantly in the late evening (e.g., +18.95 deviation from 8-9 PM), reflecting typical physiological activity and rest cycles.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess whether the participant’s perceived stress level (PSS score) falls into the top or bottom half of the study population, we consider evidence for both lower and higher stress, guided by the provided correlations. The population PSS has a mean of 21.62 and a median (50th percentile) of 22.0.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the bottom 50% (relatively low or average perceived stress):**
*   **Lower Depressive Symptoms (CESD):** A CESD score of 8.0 (Z-score = -0.55) indicates 'Not depressed', and this measure has a positive correlation with PSS (0.28). Lower depressive symptoms are thus associated with lower perceived stress.
*   **Higher Current Happiness:** The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score = 0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.19). Higher happiness is associated with lower perceived stress.
*   **Excellent Cardiovascular Fitness (RHR & Mesor):** A significantly low Resting Heart Rate (49.4 bpm, Z-score = -1.04) and MESOR (Z-score = -1.11) suggest strong physiological resilience. RHR positively correlates with PSS (0.14), implying lower RHR is associated with lower stress.
*   **Stable Circadian Rhythm (Intradaily Variability & Autocorrelation):** The participant shows significantly low Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -1.45), which positively correlates with PSS (0.16), meaning lower variability is associated with lower stress. High 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score = 1.57) also negatively correlates with PSS (-0.17), indicating that greater circadian regularity is associated with lower stress.
*   **Consistent Sleep Patterns:** Low variability in sleep duration (Z-score = -0.69) and sleep start time (Z-score = -0.66) both positively correlate with PSS (0.14 and 0.17, respectively), suggesting that less variability in sleep patterns is associated with lower stress.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the top 50% (elevated perceived stress):**
*   **Slightly Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI):** A STAI score of 42.0 (Z-score = 0.07) indicates being 'anxious' and positively correlates with PSS (0.31). This suggests a predisposition to experience stress.
*   **Lower Self-Esteem:** The participant's self-esteem is below average (Z-score = -0.73), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.15). Lower self-esteem is associated with higher perceived stress.
*   **Subjective Sleep Disturbance (PSQI):** A PSQI score of 6.0 classifies the participant with 'Disturbed Sleep'. While the Z-score (-0.33) indicates better sleep than the average disturbed sleeper, the classification itself suggests a source of potential stress.
*   **Lack of Reading Activity:** Not engaging in reading (Z-score = -0.67) has a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), implying that lower engagement in reading is associated with higher perceived stress.
*   **Declining GPA Trend:** Although not directly correlated with PSS, a sustained decline in academic performance can be a significant source of stress for university students.
*   **Lower Heart Rate Amplitude:** Slightly lower heart rate amplitude (Z-score = -0.2) negatively correlates with PSS (-0.17), implying that a lower amplitude is associated with higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When weighing the evidence, the participant demonstrates robust physiological markers of low stress and strong self-reported well-being in key areas. The significantly low resting heart rate, high circadian rhythm stability (low IV, high 24-hour autocorrelation), and consistent sleep patterns, alongside lower depressive symptoms and higher happiness, provide substantial evidence pointing towards a relatively low perceived stress level. While factors like slightly elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, subjective sleep disturbance (despite objective consistency), and a declining GPA are pertinent considerations for stress, the strength and consistency of the physiological data and core psychological well-being indicators (CESD, Happiness) are more compelling. The participant appears to possess a resilient physiological system and a generally positive emotional state that would likely buffer against excessively high perceived stress. Therefore, despite some psychological vulnerabilities and academic challenges, the overall profile suggests a PSS score falling into the bottom half of the study population.

92412,16.0,0.04922279792746114,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notably resilient psychological profile, characterized by exceptionally low self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD score 3.0, Z-score -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI score 32.0, Z-score -0.92), both classified as not depressed or anxious. These indicators are reinforced by a substantially higher level of self-esteem (score 44.0, Z-score 0.82) and a significantly elevated self-reported happiness score (current 5.0, Z-score 1.64), suggesting strong emotional well-being. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 0.63). Academically, a consistent perfect 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters reflects robust performance and intellectual engagement. This collective evidence points to a psychologically stable and thriving individual.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates a highly health-conscious and disciplined approach. Substance use is entirely absent across all monitored categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), with all corresponding Z-scores significantly negative. Exercise habits are remarkably strong, with engagement in solo exercise, group exercise, and sports all occurring at frequencies well above the population average (Z-scores 1.07, 1.23, and 0.91 respectively, for 'Three times a week or more' or '1-2 times a week'). Conversely, engagement in most daily recreational activities is relatively low. The participant reports less time spent watching TV/videos, playing video games, using the internet, listening to music, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies compared to peers. Notably, self-reported socializing with friends is also significantly below average (Z-score -1.41). This pattern suggests a strong focus on structured activities like exercise and academics, potentially prioritizing these over more passive leisure or extensive social interaction.

Both subjective and objective sleep data consistently indicate excellent sleep quality and regularity. The participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26) classifies their sleep as 'Good Sleep', indicating minimal subjective sleep disturbances. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score 0.76). Critically, the participant exhibits exceptionally consistent sleep patterns, with significantly lower-than-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (62 minutes, Z-score -0.87) and sleep start time (49 minutes, Z-score -0.74). The absence of daily napping (Z-score -0.86) further contributes to the profile of consolidated nighttime sleep. This robust and consistent sleep hygiene is a strong indicator of overall health and effective self-regulation.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a well-conditioned cardiovascular system and a distinct daily activity rhythm. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average resting heart rate of 53 BPM (Z-score -0.61) and a lower overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.89), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics show slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.17), reflecting consistent day-to-day patterns, while intradaily variability is also slightly elevated (Z-score 0.81), possibly suggesting dynamic physiological responses throughout the day, consistent with a highly active lifestyle. A high heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.74) indicates a robust physiological range between rest and activity. The acrophase, representing the time of peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 6:03 PM. This is strongly corroborated by the aggregated hourly heart rate data, which shows an extraordinarily pronounced peak in physiological arousal during the late afternoon and early evening, specifically between 5-6 PM, where the mean heart rate deviation from the mesor reaches an extreme 39.22 (Z-score 4.19). Other significant elevations are observed from 6-7 PM (Z-score 2.17) and 9-10 PM (Z-score 1.58). This pattern suggests intense, sustained physical or cognitive activity concentrated in the later hours of the day, consistent with both high exercise levels and a late acrophase, without apparent negative impact on sleep.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**
The participant's profile contains substantial evidence suggesting a PSS score in the bottom 50% of the study population. Self-reported psychological well-being is exceptional, with significantly low depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.07, positively correlated with PSS at 0.28) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.92, positively correlated with PSS at 0.31). This indicates a strong psychological buffer against stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.82) and very high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.19) further support lower perceived stress. Excellent subjective and objective sleep quality, marked by a 'Good Sleep' PSQI score (Z-score -1.26), above-average sleep duration (Z-score 0.76), and remarkably low variability in sleep duration and start time (Z-scores -0.87 and -0.74 respectively), are strong indicators of restorative processes that mitigate stress. Furthermore, a highly disciplined, healthy lifestyle with no substance use and significantly elevated physical exercise levels (multiple Z-scores above 1.0) serves as a potent stress-coping mechanism. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.61) and low mesor (Z-score -0.89) suggest good cardiovascular fitness, typically associated with lower physiological stress responses. High heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.74) reflects a healthy and adaptable physiological system.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**
Limited evidence points towards an elevated PSS score. The participant exhibits slightly higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.81), which has a weak positive correlation with PSS (0.17). This could suggest some internal physiological fluctuations, though it could also reflect an overall active lifestyle. The pronounced and late peak in heart rate activity during the evening (acrophase at 6:03 PM, with an extraordinary heart rate deviation Z-score of 4.19 between 5-6 PM) could, in some individuals, indicate high physiological arousal that contributes to stress. However, given the participant's excellent sleep quality and low anxiety/depression, this pattern is more likely to represent a robust, healthy response to intense activity rather than a stress-induced state. Lastly, significantly lower engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) and other recreational activities might theoretically reduce social support or leisure-based coping, but this is not reflected in the participant's high happiness or low mental health symptom scores.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
A holistic review of the multimodal data provides overwhelming evidence that the participant experiences low levels of perceived stress. The confluence of strong psychological well-being (low anxiety/depression, high happiness/self-esteem), excellent subjective and objective sleep quality and consistency, and a highly disciplined and healthy lifestyle (no substance use, high exercise) are powerful protective factors against perceived stress. While physiological data indicates robust and sometimes intense daily activity, particularly in the evenings, this appears to be part of a well-managed and healthy routine rather than a marker of chronic stress, given the context of superior sleep and mental health metrics. The minor indicators potentially associated with higher stress are weak and are strongly overshadowed by the extensive evidence for resilience and well-being. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

92038,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a profile characterized by notable psychological strengths and a generally active lifestyle, alongside specific patterns of physiological and sleep dysregulation. Self-report measures indicate significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score = -1.18) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.02) compared to the study population. This positive psychological disposition is further supported by elevated self-esteem (Z-score = 1.66), self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64), and high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 1.3). Academically, the participant maintains a strong GPA, including a perfect 4.0 in one semester. Lifestyle habits reflect frequent engagement in exercise, both alone (Z-score = 1.07) and with others (Z-score = 1.23), and a notable preference for reading (Z-score = 1.3) over screen-based recreational activities. While alcohol consumption is reported at a moderate level (1-2 times a week for beer and wine/liquor), the participant abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drug use.

Despite generally positive psychological and lifestyle indicators, the participant exhibits several patterns indicative of disturbed sleep and physiological irregularity. While the median sleep duration of 7 hours and 36 minutes (Z-score = 0.52) is slightly above average, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies sleep as disturbed. This subjective experience is substantiated by wearable data revealing considerable variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 145 minutes, Z-score = 1.0) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 114 minutes, Z-score = 0.69). These inconsistencies in sleep timing and duration are positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that erratic sleep patterns may contribute to the subjective experience of disturbed sleep despite adequate total time asleep.

Further analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms and daily physiological activity reveals a mixed pattern. The participant maintains a relatively low resting heart rate (53.4 bpm, Z-score = -0.56) and a robust circadian amplitude (Z-score = 0.99), both typically associated with good cardiovascular health and lower stress. However, physiological rhythms show signs of instability and variability. Intradaily Variability (IV) is notably elevated (Z-score = 1.23), indicating more frequent and rapid fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day, a pattern positively correlated with perceived stress. Similarly, a lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = -0.87) suggests reduced day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns. These metrics, alongside an average Interdaily Stability, point to a physiological system that may be experiencing higher internal variability, potentially reflecting demands on adaptive capacity.

Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrates distinct periods of physiological arousal. While the lowest heart rates are appropriately observed during typical sleep hours, pronounced elevations are evident during the afternoon and early evening. Specifically, deviations reach significant peaks between 3-4 PM (Z-score = 2.24) and 4-5 PM (Z-score = 2.45), followed by another notable elevation around 7-8 PM (Z-score = 1.16). These substantial positive deviations indicate periods of heightened cardiovascular activity relative to the participant's average daily rhythm, suggesting pronounced physiological responses to daily activities or stressors during these specific times. The magnitude of these afternoon peaks, while common in daily life, suggests a significant mobilization of physiological resources.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine if the participant’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score likely falls in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution (where the 50th percentile is 22.0), a holistic evaluation of the multimodal data is necessary.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress level comes from the participant's robust self-reported psychological well-being. Scores on the CES-D (Z-score = -1.18) and STAI (Z-score = -1.02) are substantially below the population average for depressive and anxious symptoms, respectively. Both of these measures show positive correlations with PSS (0.28 for CES-D, 0.31 for STAI), meaning lower scores on these scales strongly predict lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.66) and happiness (Z-score = 1.64), which are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15 and -0.19, respectively). High health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.3, correlation -0.07) and engagement in regular exercise and reading also serve as protective factors against stress. Physiologically, a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.56, correlation 0.14 with PSS indicating lower RHR associated with lower PSS) and a strong circadian amplitude (Z-score = 0.99, correlation -0.16) further align with a profile of lower overall stress. The participant also reports fewer naps than average (Z-score = -0.86), which is associated with lower PSS (correlation 0.14).

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, several indicators suggest potential contributions to elevated perceived stress. The self-reported PSQI score of 6.0 classifies the participant's sleep as disturbed, despite an average sleep duration. Wearable data reinforces sleep issues, showing significant variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.0) and sleep start time (Z-score = 0.69), both of which are positively correlated with PSS (0.14 and 0.17, respectively). Circadian rhythm metrics also suggest some irregularity, with higher Intradaily Variability (Z-score = 1.23) and lower 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score = -0.87), which are positively correlated with PSS (0.16 for IV, -0.17 for autocorrelation). Additionally, the hourly heart rate data indicates pronounced peaks of physiological arousal in the afternoon and early evening, suggesting periods of heightened physiological response to daily demands, although the correlation of these specific hourly deviations with PSS is generally low.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are clear physiological and sleep-related indicators of stress and irregularity, the overarching strength of the participant's psychological well-being measures is a dominant factor. The exceptionally low scores on depression and anxiety scales, coupled with high self-esteem and happiness, are strongly associated with lower perceived stress and represent direct measures of psychological state. The correlations for these self-reported psychological traits with PSS are generally stronger and more consistent in their direction than those for the sleep and physiological variability metrics. The presence of physiological arousal and sleep disturbances may reflect daily challenges, but the participant's robust psychological resilience and positive coping mechanisms (e.g., exercise, reading) likely mitigate their impact on overall perceived stress. Therefore, despite some physiological irregularities and disturbed sleep, the extensive evidence from self-reported psychological health strongly points towards a relatively lower level of perceived stress compared to the broader student population.

The participant presents with favorable self-reported psychological well-being indicators. Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait) are below the population average (Z-scores of -0.14 and -0.33 respectively), classifying the participant as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Given the positive correlations of these measures with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores (0.28 for CESD, 0.31 for STAI), these findings suggest a tendency towards lower perceived stress. Self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.19), further indicating a potentially lower stress profile. Other self-report measures, such as self-esteem (Z-score -0.17) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.12), are near the population mean, with weak negative correlations to PSS, suggesting a minor, if any, contribution to elevated stress.

Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13). This score is slightly above the population average and is generally associated with poorer sleep, which could contribute to higher perceived stress. Wearable data partially align with this, showing a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 1 minute, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.21). However, objective measures also reveal a relatively consistent sleep schedule, with a lower-than-average standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score -0.7), implying greater regularity. The participant reports no napping (Z-score -0.86), which is less frequent than the population average. The discrepancy between subjective ""Disturbed Sleep"" and objectively average-to-consistent sleep patterns may warrant further investigation but generally suggests some underlying sleep-related difficulties.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports no usage of alcohol (beer, wine/liquor) or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with significantly low Z-scores for all substance use categories. This indicates a very low-risk profile for substance-related coping mechanisms. Exercise habits are somewhat varied; while exercising alone is less frequent (Z-score -1.18), the participant regularly engages in sports (1-2 times a week), evidenced by a positive Z-score of 0.91. This level of sports participation, which has a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.12), suggests a healthy physical outlet that may mitigate stress. Recreational screen-time activities (TV, video games, internet usage) are near population averages. A notable deviation is the self-report of ""do not do"" for reading (Z-score -0.67), which has a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), potentially indicating a missed opportunity for a stress-reducing activity.

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data present a profile indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, with some nuances in daily arousal. The participant's resting heart rate (51.0 bpm) and Mesor (average heart rate over the day, 64.67 bpm) are both notably lower than the population average (Z-scores of -0.85 and -1.27 respectively). Lower resting heart rates are often associated with better physical conditioning and reduced physiological stress. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest rates in early morning hours and increasing during the day. However, a distinct peak in physiological arousal is observed between 2-3 PM, where the mean heart rate deviation (13.65 bpm above Mesor) is significantly higher than the population average for that hour (Z-score 1.22). This suggests a period of elevated cardiovascular activity or demand during the early afternoon. Circadian rhythm parameters, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.16) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.1), are near population averages, suggesting a moderately regular rhythm, with a slightly above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.48) indicating good rhythmicity. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:57 PM.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a PSS score in the bottom 50% (low or average perceived stress):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators consistent with a PSS score in the lower half of the distribution. Self-reported measures of depressive symptoms (CESD score 12.0, Z-score -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI score 38.0, Z-score -0.33) are both below the population mean, classifying the individual as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" These metrics have moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31 respectively), meaning lower scores generally predict lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55), which correlates negatively with PSS (-0.19), suggesting a buffer against stress. Lifestyle behaviors include a complete absence of substance use (all categories with significantly negative Z-scores) and regular engagement in sports (Z-score 0.91), an activity type that is weakly negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12). Physiologically, a notably low resting heart rate (51.0 bpm, Z-score -0.85) and Mesor (64.67 bpm, Z-score -1.27) point towards good cardiovascular health and a generally lower baseline physiological arousal, which are often associated with lower chronic stress. The consistency in sleep start times (lower standard deviation, Z-score -0.7) also suggests a well-established daily routine, which can be protective against stress.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the top 50% (elevated perceived stress):**
Conversely, some data points suggest potential for elevated perceived stress, though their cumulative weight appears less substantial. Subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13), falls into the ""Disturbed Sleep"" category. Poorer sleep quality is generally associated with higher PSS. Wearable data shows a slightly below-average median sleep duration (7 hours 1 minute, Z-score -0.21). In terms of physiological arousal, while overall baseline heart rates are low, the participant exhibits a significantly elevated mean heart rate deviation during the 2-3 PM hour (Z-score 1.22), indicating a period of higher-than-average physiological activation relative to the population. The participant also reports not engaging in reading as a recreational activity (Z-score -0.67), an activity which has a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), suggesting that the absence of this potentially stress-reducing habit might contribute marginally to higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Weighing the evidence, the participant's overall profile strongly aligns with a lower or average level of perceived stress. The robust indicators of lower depressive symptoms, lower trait anxiety, higher happiness, and excellent cardiovascular health (low resting heart rate and mesor) are powerful protective factors against high perceived stress. While the self-reported disturbed sleep and a specific afternoon physiological arousal peak warrant attention, they do not appear to override the broader pattern of psychological well-being and physiological resilience. The consistent engagement in physical activity and complete abstinence from substance use further support a healthy coping profile. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, the participant's perceived stress level is more likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

29792,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions alongside robust engagement in both adaptive and potentially maladaptive coping behaviors. Psychologically, the individual reports slightly above average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17) and is classified as ""anxious,"" a factor positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). Despite this, measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.03) are within the typical range, and self-esteem (Z-score: 0.26) and happiness (Z-score: 0.55) are reported as above average, with both negatively correlating with perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also slightly above average (Z-score: 0.22), further suggesting areas of psychological resilience.

A prominent feature of this participant's profile is a significantly disrupted sleep pattern and related physiological rhythms. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 7.0 (Z-score: 0.13). Wearable data corroborates severe sleep anomalies, revealing a median sleep duration of only 6 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score: -1.25), which is considerably below the study population's average. Critically, the median sleep start time is exceptionally late, at 04:31:59 AM. Physiologically, the circadian rhythm metrics show a significantly reduced autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.12), indicating a lack of consistent day-to-day rhythmicity, a factor negatively correlated with perceived stress. While Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 0.42) is slightly above average and Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -0.32) is below average, suggesting some within-day smoothness and between-day pattern, the overall lack of strong 24-hour regularity is a key concern. Hourly heart rate data further supports this disruption, with significantly elevated heart rate deviations relative to the mesor observed during early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM: Z-score 1.56; 1-2 AM: Z-score 1.59; 2-3 AM: Z-score 1.74), suggesting physiological arousal during typical sleep onset periods. The participant's acrophase (peak heart rate) occurs late in the evening at 7:39 PM, with a particularly high heart rate deviation at 7-8 PM (Z-score: 2.12), which could indicate a strong evening chronotype or heightened late-day activity. Despite these disruptions, the participant maintains an impressively low resting heart rate of 52.0 bpm (Z-score: -0.73), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in several habits that could influence or reflect perceived stress. Substance use is notably high, with beer consumption reported ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.72), wine or liquor ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.94), and recreational drugs ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Z-score: 1.61). These high levels of substance use, while showing weak correlations with PSS in this population, represent a significant behavioral pattern that can be either a coping mechanism or a source of additional stress. Conversely, the participant also demonstrates high engagement in physical activity, exercising alone ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.32) and with others ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.23), in addition to participating in sports ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.91). Exercise, particularly sports, shows a negative correlation with perceived stress, suggesting it acts as a protective factor. Recreational screen-based activities are also high, with ""1-2 hours"" spent on watching TV/Videos/Movies (Z-score: 1.28) and ""31 minutes an hour"" on video games (Z-score: 1.71); notably, video gaming is negatively correlated with PSS, potentially serving as an effective stress-reducing leisure activity for this individual. Academic performance appears consistent, with a GPA of 3.4 in Fall 2016.

In synthesis, the participant's profile highlights a tension between significant physiological stressors and robust psychological and behavioral buffers. The severe sleep deprivation and profound circadian rhythm disruption, particularly the extremely late sleep start time and low 24-hour heart rate autocorrelation, represent substantial physiological burdens that are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. These disruptions are further complicated by slightly elevated trait anxiety and high substance use. However, the participant's strong engagement in exercise, above-average self-esteem and happiness, and good cardiovascular fitness (low resting heart rate) appear to act as protective factors, potentially mitigating some of the effects of these stressors. The high levels of video gaming, a leisure activity negatively correlated with PSS, might also contribute to stress reduction. Despite these adaptive resources, the sheer magnitude of the sleep and circadian disturbance, coupled with objective physiological markers of arousal during typical rest periods, suggests a considerable underlying physiological strain.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

1.  **Trait Anxiety (STAI):** The participant reports above-average trait anxiety (Score: 43.0, Z-score: 0.17), classified as ""anxious."" This measure positively correlates with PSS (0.31), indicating a propensity for higher perceived stress.
2.  **Sleep Quality (PSQI):** A score of 7.0 (Z-score: 0.13) classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a condition frequently associated with increased stress levels.
3.  **Sleep Duration:** The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score: -1.25) is significantly short, a well-established physiological stressor.
4.  **Sleep Start Time:** An exceptionally late median sleep start time of 04:31:59 AM indicates severe circadian misalignment, a major source of physiological and psychological stress.
5.  **Circadian Rhythm Regularity (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours):** The significantly low value (Z-score: -1.12) and negative correlation with PSS (-0.17) suggest highly irregular daily rhythms, which is a strong indicator of elevated stress.
6.  **Hourly Heart Rate Deviations:** Elevated heart rate relative to the mesor during early morning hours (e.g., 12-3 AM, Z-scores up to 1.74) indicates physiological arousal during a period traditionally associated with rest, suggesting physiological strain or disrupted sleep architecture.
7.  **Substance Usage:** High levels of alcohol and recreational drug use could serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms for stress, or themselves contribute to stress and physiological disruption.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

1.  **Depressive Symptoms (CESD):** The participant's CESD score (13.0, Z-score: -0.03) is average, indicating no significant depressive symptom burden, which often co-occurs with high stress.
2.  **Self-Esteem and Happiness:** Both self-esteem (Z-score: 0.26) and happiness (Z-score: 0.55) are above average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15 and -0.19 respectively), serving as protective psychological factors.
3.  **Health Satisfaction:** Above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: 0.22) also suggests a buffer against perceived stress.
4.  **Resting Heart Rate:** A low resting heart rate of 52.0 bpm (Z-score: -0.73) indicates good cardiovascular fitness, generally associated with lower physiological stress.
5.  **Exercise Engagement:** High levels of exercise, particularly organized sports (Z-score: 0.91), which has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.13), act as a significant stress buffer.
6.  **Intradaily Variability:** Slightly below-average Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -0.32), which is positively correlated with PSS, suggests smoother activity within the day, often indicative of lower physiological fragmentation.
7.  **Video Game Usage:** High engagement in video games (Z-score: 1.71) is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.14), suggesting this activity might be an effective coping mechanism.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The participant's profile presents a compelling case for elevated perceived stress, placing them in the top half of the population distribution. While several psychological traits (high self-esteem, happiness, good health satisfaction) and behavioral habits (high exercise, video gaming) serve as protective factors against stress, the severity and pervasiveness of the sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are paramount. The extremely short sleep duration, exceptionally late sleep onset, self-reported disturbed sleep, and critically, the low 24-hour heart rate autocorrelation reflecting disrupted physiological rhythmicity, collectively represent a profound physiological stressor. These objective and self-reported indicators of severe sleep-wake dysfunction are highly salient and outweigh the positive psychological buffers. Although the participant's physical fitness is excellent (low resting heart rate), the chronic burden of sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment likely places significant strain on the body's allostatic load. The slightly elevated trait anxiety further supports a predisposition to higher perceived stress. Therefore, despite resilience in certain domains, the cumulative physiological and behavioral evidence strongly points towards a PSS score in the higher range.

14737,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a mixed psychological and behavioral profile, with several indicators suggesting potential challenges in stress management, alongside some adaptive characteristics. Psychologically, the individual exhibits slightly elevated trait anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 45.0 (Z-score = 0.37), classified as ""anxious,"" which positively correlates with perceived stress (r = 0.31). Self-esteem is notably below the population average (score 34.0, Z-score = -0.59) and negatively correlated with perceived stress (r = -0.15), suggesting that lower self-worth may contribute to heightened stress levels. Despite these factors, depressive symptoms (CESD score 14.0, Z-score = 0.07) are within the non-depressed range and near the population average, and self-reported happiness is above average (score 4.0, Z-score = 0.55), with a negative correlation to perceived stress (r = -0.19). Academic performance shows a concerning trend, with a decline in GPA from 3.62 in Fall 2015 to 3.1 in Fall 2016, which could represent a significant source of academic stress. Overall satisfaction with physical health is also below average (score 3.56, Z-score = -0.53).

Sleep patterns appear significantly disrupted, representing a key area of potential concern for perceived stress. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is 6.0, classifying it as ""Disturbed Sleep."" While the associated Z-score of -0.33 suggests this participant's sleep disturbance is less severe than the average within the study population, the score still indicates clinically relevant issues. Objective Fitbit data further corroborates poor sleep, showing a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score = -1.41), which is substantially below the population average and weakly negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.05). Furthermore, both sleep duration (standard deviation = 133 minutes, Z-score = 0.74) and sleep start time (standard deviation = 135 minutes, Z-score = 1.14) exhibit high variability, with a late median sleep start time of 01:47:16. Both duration and start time variability positively correlate with PSS (r = 0.14 and r = 0.17, respectively), indicating that inconsistent sleep patterns are associated with higher perceived stress.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant demonstrates very low engagement in substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for beer (Z-score = -1.12), wine or liquor (Z-score = -1.3), recreational drugs (Z-score = -0.31), and non-prescribed drugs (Z-score = -0.11). This absence of maladaptive coping mechanisms is a positive indicator. However, engagement in physical exercise is consistently low across categories, including exercising alone (1-2 times a month, Z-score = -0.43), exercising with others (""Not at all"", Z-score = -1.58), and sports (""Not at all"", Z-score = -1.09), potentially limiting a significant avenue for stress relief. Daily recreational habits reveal high engagement in video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score = 0.96) and a sedentary hobby (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.41), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress (r = -0.14 and r = -0.05 respectively), suggesting they may function as coping strategies. A particularly notable finding is the very low frequency of socializing with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-score = -1.41), which positively correlates with perceived stress (r = 0.06). This suggests a potential lack of social support, a critical buffer against stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics offer insights into the participant's cardiovascular and circadian rhythms. The participant exhibits a relatively stable circadian rhythm in heart rate, with Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 0.33) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 0.22) slightly above average, both negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.12 and r = -0.17). The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also above average (Z-score = 0.53) and negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.17), suggesting a robust daily physiological fluctuation, peaking at 4:54 PM. However, Intradaily Variability is above average (Z-score = 0.67) and positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.16), indicating greater fragmentation or irregularity within daily activity-rest patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is below average (54.2 bpm, Z-score = -0.47), which is generally considered a positive health marker, though its positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.14) suggests it does not entirely mitigate stress for this individual. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a strong physiological rhythm: heart rates are significantly low during early morning sleep (e.g., 5-6 AM, Z-score = -1.11) and show a prominent peak in the late afternoon/early evening, with the highest deviation observed between 6-7 PM (value = 22.05, Z-score = 1.65). Despite its high magnitude, this peak's negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.13) suggests it may represent a healthy, robust daily physiological response rather than an indicator of chronic stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The overall assessment of the participant's perceived stress level, integrating psychological, behavioral, and physiological data, suggests a likely placement in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%):**
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety:** The STAI score (Z-score = 0.37) is above average and its positive correlation with PSS (0.31) strongly links it to higher perceived stress.
*   **Low Self-Esteem:** A below-average self-esteem score (Z-score = -0.59) negatively correlates with PSS (-0.15), indicating it likely contributes to greater stress vulnerability.
*   **Academic Decline:** The observed decrease in GPA across academic semesters suggests a significant academic stressor.
*   **Significant Sleep Disturbance:** The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep."" Critically, objective Fitbit data reveals a markedly short median sleep duration (6 hours 3 minutes, Z-score = -1.41) and high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score = 0.74, r=0.14 with PSS) and sleep start time (Z-score = 1.14, r=0.17 with PSS). These objective sleep deficits and inconsistencies are strongly associated with higher perceived stress.
*   **Limited Social Support:** Very low engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score = -1.41) and its positive correlation with PSS (0.06) suggests a potential lack of a key stress-buffering resource.
*   **Intradaily Variability:** Above-average intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score = 0.67) and its positive correlation with PSS (0.16) points to fragmented daily rhythms often seen in higher stress states.
*   **Low Exercise Frequency:** Infrequent physical activity across all categories removes a common and effective stress-coping mechanism.

**Evidence for Low/Median PSS (Bottom 50%):**
*   **Average Depressive Symptoms:** The CESD score (Z-score = 0.07) is near the population mean and does not suggest high depressive burden.
*   **Higher Happiness:** An above-average happiness score (Z-score = 0.55) negatively correlates with PSS (-0.19), potentially acting as a buffer against stress.
*   **Very Low Substance Use:** The absence of substance use indicates the avoidance of maladaptive coping strategies in this domain.
*   **Healthier Resting Heart Rate:** A below-average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.47) is generally a positive physiological indicator.
*   **Aspects of Circadian Robustness:** Above-average Interdaily Stability, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours, and Amplitude (all negatively correlated with PSS) suggest some positive structure in physiological rhythms.
*   **Effective Recreational Coping:** Above-average engagement in video games (Z-score = 0.96, r=-0.14 with PSS) and reading (Z-score = 0.32, r=-0.21 with PSS) appear to function as stress-reducing activities.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the participant exhibits some protective factors, such as higher happiness, low substance use, and certain robust aspects of their circadian rhythm, the weight of evidence points towards significantly elevated perceived stress. The combination of elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, objective and self-reported severe sleep disturbances (short duration, high variability, disturbed quality), declining academic performance, and very limited social engagement presents a strong case for higher stress. These factors, particularly the pervasive sleep issues and lack of social support, are commonly potent contributors to perceived stress. The mitigating factors do not appear sufficient to offset the impact of these prominent stressors.

**Psychological Well-being and Affective State:**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a robust level of well-being, suggesting a disposition generally resilient to chronic stress. Scores on the CES-D (6.0, Z-score -0.76) classify the individual as ""Not depressed,"" while the STAI-Trait score (29.0, Z-score -1.22) similarly indicates an absence of significant trait anxiety, placing the participant well below the population average for both measures. These findings are reinforced by elevated self-esteem (49.0, Z-score 1.52), above-average self-reported happiness (5.0, Z-score 1.64), and high trust in others (4.17, Z-score 1.79). Additionally, the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (6.44, Z-score 1.63). The negative correlations of self-esteem, happiness, trust, and health satisfaction with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score further support the interpretation that these strengths likely contribute to a lower perceived stress level.

**Sleep Patterns and Quality:**
Both self-reported and wearable data consistently indicate healthy and sufficient sleep patterns. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26) classifies the participant as having ""Good Sleep"" quality, signifying a subjectively positive sleep experience. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 4 minutes, which is above the study population average (Z-score 1.1). The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86), further indicating a consolidated nocturnal sleep period. While sleep start time exhibits slightly above-average variability (107 minutes standard deviation, Z-score 0.53), which has a minor positive correlation with PSS, the overall picture from both subjective and objective measures points to generally restorative and sufficient sleep that would typically buffer against stress.

**Circadian Rhythm and Physiological Arousal:**
The participant exhibits a highly regular and robust heart rate-based circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability (0.58, Z-score 1.41) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.49, Z-score 1.4) are both notably high, indicating a consistent daily rhythm across multiple days. Furthermore, Intradaily Variability is very low (0.25, Z-score -2.08), suggesting minimal fragmentation or abrupt changes in heart rate within a day. The circadian amplitude is exceptionally high (17.77, Z-score 2.26), signifying a strong contrast between peak and trough heart rates, reflective of a vigorous physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak activity time, is observed at 3:42 PM. The mesor (74.33, Z-score 0.05) is average, and the resting heart rate is below average at 53.0 bpm (Z-score -0.61). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear pattern: significant drops during late night/early morning hours (e.g., -27.61 at 4-5 AM, Z-score -1.57) followed by pronounced increases during the day, peaking at 3:00-4:00 PM (30.09, Z-score 3.82). Notably, the participant's heart rate deviations in the early morning are lower than average. Given the positive correlation of these early morning deviations with PSS, this lower heart rate at specific morning hours is associated with a lower perceived stress level. The overall regularity and pronounced amplitude of this rhythm, coupled with a low resting heart rate, generally suggest a well-regulated autonomic nervous system not indicative of chronic physiological stress.

**Lifestyle and Behavioral Habits:**
The participant demonstrates generally healthy lifestyle choices regarding substance use, reporting ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" for beer and wine/liquor, and ""Not at all"" for recreational or non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low Z-scores. Exercise habits are favorable, particularly regarding ""Exercised with Others"" (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23), indicating an above-average frequency of social physical activity. Academic performance is strong, with a Fall 2015 GPA of 3.89 and Fall 2016 GPA of 3.52. In contrast, engagement in various daily recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends appears to be notably lower than the population average, with corresponding negative Z-scores (e.g., Socializing with Friends, Z-score -1.41; Internet Usage, Z-score -1.16). While the correlations of socializing and internet usage with PSS are mildly positive, suggesting lower engagement is associated with lower PSS, lower engagement in reading (Z-score -0.67, correlation -0.21) and video games (Z-score -0.56, correlation -0.14) may be weakly associated with higher perceived stress. However, these negative Z-scores for reading and video games indicate ""do not do"" as a common response, mitigating their impact as an extreme outlier for this participant.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence indicates that this participant likely experiences relatively low or average perceived stress, placing them in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. Psychologically, they exhibit notably low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.22). Concurrently, indicators of positive psychological well-being are significantly elevated, including self-esteem (Z-score 1.52), happiness (Z-score 1.64), trust (Z-score 1.79), and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.63), all of which correlate negatively with perceived stress. Sleep patterns are optimal, with self-reported good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26) and above-average sleep duration from wearable data (Z-score 1.1). Physiologically, the participant displays a highly robust and regular circadian rhythm, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.41), very low intradaily variability (Z-score -2.08), high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.4), and particularly high circadian amplitude (Z-score 2.26). These features, coupled with a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.61) and lower-than-average early morning heart rates (which positively correlate with PSS), are generally associated with lower physiological stress and efficient autonomic regulation. Furthermore, engaging in above-average ""Exercised with Others"" (Z-score 1.23) represents a positive coping behavior.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards an elevated perceived stress level is minimal and less robust. The participant's daily routine exhibits slightly above-average variability in sleep start time (Z-score 0.53), which has a modest positive correlation with PSS (0.17). Furthermore, the participant reports ""Do not do"" for reading and video games. Given the negative correlations of these activities with PSS (Reading: -0.21; Video Games: -0.14), lower engagement in these specific leisure activities may be weakly associated with slightly higher perceived stress. However, the magnitude of these correlations and Z-scores indicates these are minor factors within the overall profile.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The overwhelming evidence strongly supports the conclusion that this participant's perceived stress level is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The numerous indicators of strong psychological well-being, excellent sleep quality and duration, and a highly regular and efficient physiological circadian rhythm significantly outweigh the few minor points that might suggest slightly elevated stress. The participant appears to possess substantial internal and physiological resources that buffer against perceived stress.

This participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by a notable discrepancy between self-reported psychological traits and objective physiological and behavioral indicators. Psychologically, the participant reports relatively low levels of depressive symptoms, indicated by a CES-D score of 8.0 (Z-score -0.55), and low trait anxiety, with an STAI score of 29.0 (Z-score -1.22), both classifications falling within the ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" categories, respectively. Additionally, self-esteem is reported as high, with a score of 45.0 (Z-score 0.96). These self-reported psychological strengths would typically suggest a lower susceptibility to perceived stress. However, these positive indicators are juxtaposed with below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.53), suggesting a general underlying dissatisfaction despite the absence of elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms. Academic performance, as reflected by GPA, appears stable around a 3.0 average across semesters.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits several patterns that may contribute to or reflect physiological dysregulation. Alcohol consumption is notably high, with beer usage reported as ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.72) and wine/liquor at ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.94), although these habits show negligible correlation with PSS in the study population. Exercise engagement is moderate and slightly above average across categories. Recreational activities include high engagement with music listening (Z-score 1.13) and above-average television/video consumption, while reading and sedentary hobbies are largely absent. More critically, sleep patterns reveal significant disturbances. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates clinically significant ""Disturbed Sleep."" This is corroborated by wearable data showing a shorter than average median sleep duration of 6 hours and 39 minutes (Z-score -0.66) and a very late median sleep start time of 2:10 AM. Furthermore, the participant engages in frequent napping, with a mean of 0.25 naps per day (Z-score 2.07), which is markedly above the population average and positively correlates with perceived stress.

Physiologically, heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics suggest a substantially disrupted and attenuated daily rhythm. The participant exhibits very low Interdaily Stability (0.17, Z-score -1.98) and low Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.17, Z-score -1.29), indicating poor day-to-day consistency and a weak 24-hour rhythm in heart rate. The Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also low (7.19, Z-score -1.16), suggesting less pronounced fluctuation between peak and trough activity levels. These metrics collectively point to a less robust and potentially dysregulated physiological rhythm, which consistently negatively correlates with perceived stress. While the Resting Heart Rate of 54.1 bpm (Z-score -0.48) is below average, typically indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, this may represent a blunted overall response given the other circadian disruptions. The Acrophase, indicating the peak of cardiovascular activity, is late at 6:09 PM. This is further reflected in the hourly heart rate data, which shows pronounced deviations above the mesor during the late afternoon and evening (peaking around 7-8 PM with +13.29), and sustained elevated heart rates even after midnight (e.g., 12-1 AM with +4.64, Z-score 0.92), suggesting a delayed physiological wind-down. Conversely, heart rate deviations during mid-morning and early afternoon (10 AM - 2 PM) are notably below average (Z-scores ranging from -1.28 to -1.59), indicating lower physiological activity during typical daytime hours. This combination of a delayed and attenuated daily heart rate rhythm, coupled with poor sleep quality, suggests a significant degree of physiological stress and dysregulation that may not be fully captured by self-reported anxiety or depression scales.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine whether the participant’s perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, likely places them in the top or bottom half of the study population, a holistic review of the evidence is necessary. The population median PSS score is 22.0.

**Evidence Supporting a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The primary evidence for a lower perceived stress score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. Scores on the CES-D (depressive symptoms) and STAI (trait anxiety) are both below the population average (Z-scores -0.55 and -1.22, respectively) and are classified as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Both instruments show a positive correlation with PSS, meaning lower scores suggest lower perceived stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), which negatively correlates with PSS, also supports a lower stress profile. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is below average (Z-score -0.48), which positively correlates with PSS, thus suggesting lower physiological stress.

**Evidence Supporting a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, a substantial body of evidence points towards an elevated perceived stress level. Self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are both below average (Z-scores -0.53 for both), and both negatively correlate with PSS, implying higher perceived stress. Behaviorally, the participant reports disturbed sleep via the PSQI (Score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), a common correlate of stress. Wearable sleep metrics confirm short sleep duration and a very late sleep start time, while frequent napping (Z-score 2.07), which positively correlates with PSS, suggests compensatory sleep behavior or poor sleep consolidation.

Most significantly, objective physiological measures derived from heart rate data consistently indicate severe circadian rhythm disruption. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.98), Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score -1.29), and Amplitude (Z-score -1.16) are all markedly low, indicating an irregular, weak, and blunted daily heart rate rhythm. All three of these metrics negatively correlate with PSS, meaning their low values strongly suggest higher perceived stress. The very low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.8) also positively correlates with PSS, reinforcing the indication of elevated stress, possibly reflecting a blunted physiological responsiveness. The delayed acrophase (6:09 PM) and sustained elevated heart rates extending into the early morning hours, as observed in the hourly deviations from the mesor, further suggest a protracted period of physiological arousal or delayed wind-down, which is characteristic of physiological stress and could impact restorative sleep.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits resilience in self-reported trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, the consistent and pronounced indicators of physiological dysregulation and disturbed sleep are compelling. The extremely low Z-scores for several circadian rhythm metrics (-1.98 for Interdaily Stability, -1.29 for 24-hour Autocorrelation, -1.16 for Amplitude) represent significant deviations from the population average in a direction associated with higher stress. These objective physiological markers, combined with self-reported poor sleep quality (PSQI), frequent napping, and lower general well-being (happiness and health satisfaction), collectively suggest a considerable underlying physiological and behavioral burden. These factors are highly likely to contribute to an elevated perception of stress, even if specific anxiety or depressive traits are not pronounced. The magnitude and consistency of the objective physiological and sleep-related indicators outweigh the self-reported psychological trait measures in this context.

Therefore, the participant's overall perceived stress level is more likely to be in the top half of the study population distribution.

30152,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents a nuanced picture. Depressive symptomology, as measured by the CESD, is below the study population average (score 11.0, Z-score -0.24), indicating a relatively low depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety, however, is at the population average (STAI score 41.0, Z-score -0.03), though classified as ""anxious,"" suggesting a typical level of chronic anxiety proneness within this student cohort. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.31), and self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score -0.53); both factors show weak negative correlations with perceived stress, indicating a slight potential for higher stress levels. Conversely, the participant reports notably high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3), which is weakly associated with lower perceived stress, potentially acting as a buffering factor. Trust levels are below average (Z-score -0.46), though this factor shows a negligible correlation with perceived stress. Academically, the participant maintains consistently strong GPAs, suggesting effective academic performance.

Sleep quality emerges as a significant area of concern for this participant. Self-report via the PSQI indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), suggesting a subjective experience of poor sleep. Objective Fitbit data corroborates this, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 48 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.48). Furthermore, both sleep duration (standard deviation 118 minutes, Z-score 0.39) and sleep start time (standard deviation 102 minutes, Z-score 0.41) exhibit above-average variability, indicating an inconsistent sleep schedule. A late median sleep start time of 2:28 AM further points to a potentially irregular or delayed sleep-wake rhythm. In terms of lifestyle, the participant regularly engages in solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) but reports no participation in group exercise or sports. Alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) is slightly above the population average. Leisure activities involve above-average time spent watching TV/videos and using the internet (Z-scores 1.28 and 0.85, respectively), while engagement in music listening and reading is below average. These lifestyle patterns, particularly sleep inconsistencies and certain leisure choices, show weak positive correlations with perceived stress, suggesting a potential contribution to or reflection of elevated stress.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z-score -1.04) and a low overall heart rate mesor (62.67 bpm, Z-score -1.54), indicative of good baseline cardiovascular fitness. Despite this, circadian rhythm metrics suggest a degree of instability: interdaily stability is below average (Z-score -0.49), and the 24-hour autocorrelation is significantly low (Z-score -1.45), implying less predictable and less robust daily heart rate patterns. These physiological rhythm irregularities are weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting a connection between less stability and potentially higher perceived stress. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of pronounced physiological arousal in the late afternoon and early evening, peaking between 4-5 PM with a substantial deviation of 24.58 bpm (Z-score 2.34) above the mesor. The acrophase, or time of peak cardiovascular activity, occurs at 5:17 PM. This significant and concentrated period of elevated cardiovascular activity suggests a consistent period of high activity or a heightened physiological stress response during these hours, following typical sleep-associated heart rate reductions in the early morning.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Several factors suggest the participant may experience elevated perceived stress. The self-reported PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a condition frequently associated with higher stress levels. Objective sleep data from Fitbit reinforces this, showing below-average sleep duration and, more significantly, above-average variability in both sleep duration and sleep start times (Z-scores 0.39 and 0.41, respectively). These objective measures of sleep inconsistency correlate weakly but positively with PSS. Furthermore, the participant exhibits below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.49) and notably low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.45) in heart rate rhythms, indicating less regular physiological patterns, which are weakly correlated with higher PSS. The significant physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon (peaking at 4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.34 for heart rate deviation from mesor) suggests a consistent period of heightened physiological activity or stress response. While the STAI trait anxiety score is average (Z-score -0.03), the classification as ""anxious"" combined with a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.31) suggests a baseline propensity that could contribute to perceived stress. Slightly below-average self-esteem and happiness, while weakly correlated, also add to the overall picture that might push PSS higher.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, some indicators suggest lower or average perceived stress. The CESD score of 11.0 (Z-score -0.24) indicates below-average depressive symptoms, which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.28), implying lower depressive symptoms are linked to lower perceived stress. The participant also reports notably high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3), which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS, potentially acting as a minor protective factor. Physiologically, a very low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z-score -1.04) and overall heart rate mesor (62.67 bpm, Z-score -1.54) point to good baseline cardiovascular fitness, generally associated with better health and stress resilience. While the direct correlation of RHR with PSS in this dataset is weakly positive (0.14), the underlying fitness level could still be a buffer.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits strong indicators of good physical health and low depressive symptoms, the overall pattern of compromised sleep quality and consistency, coupled with irregularities in objective physiological rhythms, points towards an elevated experience of perceived stress. The significant and consistent physiological arousal detected in the late afternoon further supports the presence of ongoing stressors or a heightened stress response. The subjective experience of ""disturbed sleep,"" combined with objective measures of fragmented and irregular sleep and circadian patterns, strongly suggests challenges in daily regulation and recovery that are common manifestations of stress. The balance of evidence, particularly the pervasive sleep and physiological dysregulation, outweighs the factors suggesting lower stress. Therefore, it is more probable that this participant's perceived stress level falls within the higher end of the study population distribution.

59592,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates an elevated level of chronic anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI score of 46.0, which corresponds to a Z-score of 0.46, placing them above the population mean for this trait. This measure exhibits a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31). Concurrently, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (score 35.0, Z-score -0.45) and current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, implying that lower self-esteem and happiness are associated with higher stress levels. In contrast, self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD score 14.0, Z-score 0.07) are near the population average and classified as ""Not depressed,"" suggesting that significant depressive symptom burden is not a primary concern. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), is notably better than the population average, indicating good self-perceived sleep. Academic performance, reflected in consistently strong GPAs, suggests effective academic functioning.

Physiological and sleep metrics reveal a pattern of both regularity and dysregulation. While the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, objective sleep data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes (Z-score -0.29), which is slightly below the population mean. However, consistency in sleep patterns is a notable strength, with a remarkably low standard deviation in sleep start times (39 minutes, Z-score -0.97), indicating highly regular sleep onset. Despite this consistency in timing, the participant exhibits several markers of circadian rhythm fragmentation and a blunted physiological rhythm. The Resting Heart Rate (66.1 bpm, Z-score 0.95) is significantly elevated compared to the study population, a factor positively correlated with perceived stress (0.14). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show lower-than-average Interdaily Stability (0.3, Z-score -0.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.26, Z-score -0.53), suggesting less regularity in heart rate patterns across days. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (0.78, Z-score 1.65) is significantly higher than average, indicating more fragmented physiological activity within a single day. Furthermore, the circadian Amplitude (6.93, Z-score -1.25) is considerably lower than the population mean, pointing to a blunted distinction between peak and trough heart rate activity. These three circadian metrics are negatively correlated with PSS (lower stability/amplitude, higher variability associated with higher PSS), reinforcing their relevance to stress. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is 77.31 bpm (Z-score 0.46), also indicating a generally elevated cardiovascular baseline. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest rates observed during early morning sleep hours and peaks during daytime and early evening. While the *pattern* of these hourly fluctuations is consistent with normal activity cycles, the overall context of a high resting heart rate and a blunted circadian amplitude suggests a state of chronic physiological arousal or reduced autonomic flexibility, even if the *magnitude* of hourly deviations is not extreme relative to the population.

Behavioral habits present a mixed picture. The participant reports engaging in wine or liquor consumption 1-2 times a week, which is notably above the population average (Z-score 0.94), though its correlation with PSS is negligible in this dataset. Exercise largely occurs alone (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.32), while engagement in sports or exercise with others is significantly below average. Daily recreational activities are characterized by higher-than-average engagement in passive screen-based activities, specifically watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), as well as sedentary hobbies. Conversely, the participant reports not engaging in reading (Z-score -0.67) or video games (Z-score -0.56). Notably, a lack of reading exhibits the strongest negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.21) among the recreational activities, suggesting that reduced engagement in this activity is associated with higher stress. Similarly, not participating in sports is also negatively correlated with PSS (-0.13). These patterns suggest a preference for certain forms of passive recreation and a disengagement from activities that may typically serve as stress buffers or social outlets for others.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Analysis of the multimodal data provides substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, is likely within the top half of the study population distribution.

Evidence indicating a higher PSS score includes several robust psychological and physiological markers. The participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46) and reports lower levels of self-esteem (Z-score -0.45) and current happiness (Z-score -0.53), all of which are correlated with higher perceived stress. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is significantly elevated (Z-score 0.95) and positively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, multiple indicators of circadian rhythm dysregulation point towards elevated stress: significantly higher intradaily variability (Z-score 1.65), lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9), and a blunted circadian amplitude (Z-score -1.25), all of which are associated with higher PSS scores according to their respective correlations. Behavioral patterns, such as a lack of engagement in reading and sports, also align with higher perceived stress based on the provided correlations.

Conversely, some data points suggest potentially lower or average stress. The participant's subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) is notably good, and sleep onset times are highly consistent (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score -0.97). Additionally, self-reported depressive symptoms are not elevated (CESD Z-score 0.07). However, these positive indicators, while important for overall well-being, appear to be outweighed by the pervasive evidence of elevated trait anxiety and significant physiological dysregulation (particularly the high resting heart rate and fragmented, blunted circadian rhythm) that are strongly correlated with increased perceived stress. The combination of psychological vulnerability and objective physiological markers of arousal and disorganization suggests that the participant experiences a higher level of perceived stress despite some mitigating factors related to subjective sleep.

Based on the holistic analysis, the preponderance of evidence, particularly the elevated trait anxiety and multiple physiological indicators of stress and circadian disruption with relevant correlations, strongly supports the conclusion that the participant's PSS score would place them in the top 50% of the study population.

89652,28.0,0.961139896373057,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notably robust psychological profile, which strongly suggests lower levels of perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate very low depressive symptoms (CESD score 5.0, Z-score -0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI score 35.0, Z-score -0.62), both classifying the participant as 'not depressed' and 'not anxious' respectively, and correlating positively with PSS. Complementing this, self-esteem is notably high (score 44.0, Z-score 0.82), which inversely correlates with PSS, and reported happiness is significantly above average (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), also negatively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, the participant reports exceptionally high trust in others (Z-score 2.75) and maintains a consistently high academic GPA across semesters, signaling strong psychological well-being and successful academic adaptation. Lifestyle habits reinforce this positive outlook; the participant reports no substance usage across all categories, indicating a health-conscious approach. While general exercise frequency is moderate, engagement in sports is higher than average (Z-score 0.91), which has a negative correlation with PSS. Recreational habits show lower engagement in passive screen-based activities but slightly higher engagement in reading, a habit that negatively correlates with PSS. Overall, these self-reported psychological traits and lifestyle choices present a compelling picture of an individual with significant internal resources and healthy coping mechanisms, which are typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Despite the strong indicators of psychological well-being, objective sleep and circadian rhythm data present a more complex picture. Self-reported sleep quality is excellent (PSQI score 4.0, Z-score -1.26), categorizing the participant as having 'Good Sleep' and correlating negatively with PSS. However, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 34 minutes, which is shorter than the population median (Z-score -0.76). More critically, the variability in sleep duration is substantially high (standard deviation of 172 minutes, Z-score 1.62), and there is moderate variability in sleep start time (standard deviation of 106 minutes, Z-score 0.51), with a notably late median sleep start time of 02:54:29. Both high sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability positively correlate with PSS. Additionally, the participant engages in more daily napping than average (Z-score 1.49), which also positively correlates with PSS. This discrepancy between subjective good sleep quality and objective irregularities, particularly the high variability and late sleep onset, suggests a potentially demanding schedule or lifestyle that impacts sleep consistency, even if the participant does not subjectively perceive their sleep as poor.

Further analysis of circadian rhythm and physiological arousal from heart rate data reveals additional nuances. The participant's interdaily stability (IS) is slightly above average (Z-score 0.17), suggesting a relatively stable day-to-day heart rate pattern, which negatively correlates with PSS. However, intradaily variability (IV) is significantly higher than average (Z-score 1.3), indicating more fragmented activity/rest cycles within the day, a pattern that positively correlates with PSS. Correspondingly, the 24-hour autocorrelation is lower than average (Z-score -0.87), suggesting less consistent daily repetition of the heart rate rhythm, with lower autocorrelation negatively correlating with PSS (implying higher stress). The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late at 4:37 PM, aligning with the late sleep onset observed. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal periods of notably elevated physiological arousal, particularly during the early to mid-afternoon (e.g., 1-2 PM with Z-score 0.93, 2-3 PM with Z-score 0.97, and 3-4 PM with Z-score 1.61), indicating more heightened activity during these hours compared to peers. The resting heart rate is also slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.26), which positively correlates with PSS. These physiological patterns—high intradaily variability, lower daily rhythm consistency, and marked periods of elevated heart rate—could signify an underlying physiological strain or an active engagement with academic or other demands, even in the context of reported low psychological stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a low PSS score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being and mental health. Exceptionally low scores on the CES-D (not depressed, Z-score -0.86) and STAI (not anxious, Z-score -0.62) are robust indicators, and both scales correlate positively with PSS, meaning lower scores here predict lower PSS. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.82) and very high reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) further bolster this, as both negatively correlate with PSS. The participant also reports 'Good Sleep' on the PSQI (Z-score -1.26), which, despite contradictions with objective sleep data, reflects their subjective experience and correlates positively with PSS (lower PSQI means lower PSS). These psychological protective factors are significant, as PSS directly assesses subjective perception of stress. Furthermore, a healthy substance use profile, higher engagement in sports (negatively correlated with PSS), and higher reading habits (negatively correlated with PSS) contribute to a profile associated with lower stress. The slightly above-average Interdaily Stability in heart rate also weakly supports lower PSS.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, several objective physiological and behavioral metrics suggest potential physiological strain that might correlate with higher stress. The most salient findings include significantly high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.62), moderately high variability in sleep start time (Z-score 0.51), and increased napping (Z-score 1.49), all of which positively correlate with PSS. Objective circadian rhythm disturbances, specifically high Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.3) and lower 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score -0.87), also show positive correlations with PSS (higher IV means higher PSS; lower Autocorrelation means higher PSS). Additionally, the participant exhibits markedly elevated hourly heart rates during peak afternoon periods compared to peers, and a slightly higher resting heart rate (Z-score 0.26), which positively correlates with PSS. These physiological markers indicate a potentially demanding lifestyle or a heightened state of arousal.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are clear objective physiological and sleep irregularities that, in isolation, might point towards higher stress, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) fundamentally measures an individual's *subjective appraisal* of stress. The participant's self-reported data consistently indicates a strong psychological foundation, characterized by very low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high happiness. These subjective psychological indicators are exceptionally robust and are generally more direct predictors of perceived stress than physiological metrics. It is highly plausible that this participant possesses strong coping mechanisms or a high level of resilience that buffers them from subjectively perceiving the physiological demands of their lifestyle as distressing. Given the overwhelming evidence from self-report measures that directly tap into the construct of perceived stress, the participant is most likely to report a low to average PSS score.

28724,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant's self-reported psychological profile generally indicates positive mental well-being, with notable strengths in self-perception and emotional state. Specifically, the participant reported significantly higher happiness than the study population (Z-score 1.64) and slightly above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11). Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, were below the population average (Z-score -0.76), classifying the participant as ""not depressed."" Trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, was near the population mean (Z-score -0.13), indicating typical levels of chronic anxiety proneness, though the classification of ""anxious"" is noted. Despite these positive self-reported indicators, the participant reported slightly below-average satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -0.2). Academically, the participant demonstrates high achievement with a Fall 2016 GPA of 3.93. Behavioral habits include frequent solo exercise, occurring three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), suggesting an active lifestyle and a potential coping mechanism. Consumption of wine or liquor was reported at 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Z-score 0.94).

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture, combining objective consistency with subjective disturbance. According to wearable data, the participant demonstrates remarkably consistent sleep habits, with a significantly less variable sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score -0.81) and exceptionally stable sleep start times (standard deviation Z-score -1.22) compared to the study population. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes is notably longer than the average for the population (Z-score 0.79). However, despite these objective markers of regularity and adequate duration, the participant's self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates ""disturbed sleep."" While this score is slightly better than the population average (Z-score -0.33), the classification of disturbed sleep suggests qualitative issues not captured by duration or timing alone.

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms reveals significant physiological dysregulation and heightened arousal patterns. The participant exhibits notably reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.74) and significantly lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.12), alongside markedly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51) when compared to the study population. These metrics collectively indicate a less regular and more fragmented physiological rhythm across days, with greater fluctuations in heart rate within a single day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.57), suggesting a somewhat dampened but unstable daily oscillation. The participant's resting heart rate of 59.8 bpm is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.2), which can be an indicator of underlying physiological tension.

Further examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrates distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. While pre-sleep heart rates (9 PM-12 AM) show a pronounced decrease relative to the population (Z-scores down to -1.33), indicative of effective physiological winding down, the daytime hours reveal substantial periods of elevated activity. Specifically, heart rates were significantly higher than both the participant's mesor and the population's average deviation during late morning (11 AM-12 PM, Z-score 1.71) and early afternoon (1 PM-2 PM, Z-score 2.1). These pronounced peaks suggest periods of intense physiological arousal and activity. Interestingly, heart rates during the early morning sleep period (3 AM-7 AM) were also relatively higher than the population average for those hours (Z-scores up to 0.44), despite overall low absolute values. This suggests a pattern of intense physiological response during peak daily demands, alongside some sustained arousal even during typical rest periods, which collectively points to a heightened physiological stress response.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-report data strongly suggests a relatively lower level of perceived stress. They report significantly higher happiness (Z-score 1.64) and lower depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.76) than the population mean, both of which correlate negatively with PSS. Self-esteem is also above average (Z-score 0.11), a factor associated with lower perceived stress. Regarding sleep, objective wearable metrics indicate highly consistent sleep duration (Z-score -0.81) and remarkably stable sleep start times (Z-score -1.22), patterns typically linked to lower stress. The self-reported PSQI score, while indicating ""disturbed sleep,"" is actually slightly better than the population average (Z-score -0.33) and correlates negatively with PSS, further suggesting a tendency towards lower perceived stress in this domain relative to peers. Engagement in frequent solo exercise (Z-score 1.07) also indicates a positive coping strategy that can mitigate stress.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, substantial physiological data points towards an elevated stress response, potentially indicating a higher perceived stress level. The heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal significant dysregulation: the participant exhibits markedly higher intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51) and significantly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.74) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.12). These patterns signify a less stable and more fragmented physiological rhythm, which is strongly associated with higher PSS. Furthermore, the analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows periods of intense physiological arousal, particularly during late morning (11 AM-12 PM, Z-score 1.71) and early afternoon (1 PM-2 PM, Z-score 2.1), which are among the highest in the study population. The resting heart rate is also slightly above average (Z-score 0.2), and even early morning sleep heart rates are relatively elevated compared to peers. These objective physiological markers collectively suggest a significant burden of physiological stress. While self-reported trait anxiety (STAI) is near the population average, the ""anxious"" classification may indicate a predisposition to experience stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
A holistic evaluation reveals a notable dichotomy between the participant's positive self-reported psychological well-being and consistent objective sleep patterns on one hand, and significant physiological indicators of stress and dysregulation on the other. While the participant reports being happier and less depressed, and objectively maintains consistent sleep schedules, their body exhibits pronounced signs of physiological strain. The magnitude and consistency of the deviations in circadian rhythm metrics (high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability and autocorrelation) and the extreme peaks in daytime physiological arousal are particularly compelling, with Z-scores indicating strong deviations from the population mean. These objective physiological markers, which directly correlate with perceived stress in the population, suggest a substantial underlying stress load that may not be fully captured or acknowledged in self-report, or that manifests despite effective coping in other areas. Therefore, despite positive self-reported mental health, the overwhelming evidence from physiological data suggests that the participant likely experiences a higher level of perceived stress.

The participant presents a mixed profile across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains. Self-report measures indicate relatively low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.34) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33), suggesting that the participant does not experience chronic anxiety or depressive moods at rates higher than the average study population. However, self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.31), and reported happiness is notably lower (Z-score -0.53). A significant concern emerges from the participant's academic performance, marked by a consistent decline in GPA across semesters, culminating in a 1.9 GPA in Fall 2016, which suggests substantial academic challenges. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is considerably lower than the population mean (Z-score -1.2), and the participant's BMI of 15.6 indicates they are underweight. These subjective and objective indicators of academic difficulty and physical well-being suggest potential underlying stressors despite the comparatively low self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Sleep patterns reveal a paradox between subjective experience and objective metrics. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as having ""disturbed sleep,"" indicating subjective sleep difficulties. However, the associated Z-score of -0.33 suggests that, relative to the study population, their subjective sleep quality is slightly *better* than average. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a remarkably high median sleep duration of 8 hours (Z-score 1.01), significantly longer than the population average. Despite a late median sleep start time of 1:35 AM, sleep onset is exceptionally consistent, with a very low standard deviation (Z-score -1.05). There is no reported napping. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data indicates average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, but slightly lower intradaily variability (Z-score -0.74), which may suggest a more stable or less fluctuating daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase, representing the peak in the heart rate circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:43 PM.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, reporting no engagement in general exercise, either alone (Z-score -1.93) or with others (Z-score -1.58). This is partially mitigated by participation in organized sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91). Substance use data indicates higher-than-average consumption of beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Leisure time is heavily skewed towards passive and social activities, including extensive time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.91), using the internet (Z-score 1.52), listening to music (Z-score 2.06), and socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53). Conversely, engagement in video games and reading is absent. Physiologically, the participant’s resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.26). However, an examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct periods of physiological arousal. Heart rates are appropriately suppressed during early morning sleep hours. In contrast, significant and sustained elevations in heart rate are observed during waking hours, notably from late morning through the evening. Pronounced peaks occur around 12-1 PM (deviation 14.79, Z-score 0.96) and particularly between 6-8 PM (deviations 17.3 and 18.13, Z-scores 0.83 and 1.15 respectively). These sustained periods of elevated cardiovascular activity align with the late acrophase and suggest a heightened state of physiological arousal during much of the active day.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**:
The participant reports depressive symptoms and trait anxiety levels that are below the study population average, with CESD and STAI Z-scores of -0.34 and -0.33 respectively, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Objectively, Fitbit data shows a robust median sleep duration of 8 hours, significantly exceeding the population average (Z-score 1.01), coupled with remarkably consistent sleep start times (Z-score -1.05). Consistent and adequate sleep is generally associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the intradaily variability in heart rate is slightly lower than average (Z-score -0.74), suggesting a somewhat more stable and predictable physiological rhythm throughout the day, which could indicate a lower propensity for internal reactivity. The participant also exhibits a slightly below-average resting heart rate, which can be a marker of good cardiovascular health or lower baseline physiological stress.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%)**:
A primary indicator of elevated stress is the participant's declining academic performance, with GPA dropping from 2.67 to 1.9 across semesters. This significant and sustained academic struggle is a common and potent source of perceived stress in university students. While objective sleep duration is high, the participant’s PSQI score of 6.0 indicates subjectively ""disturbed sleep,"" exceeding the clinical threshold and implying perceived difficulties despite ample sleep. Moreover, self-reported happiness is notably lower than average (Z-score -0.53), and satisfaction with physical health is significantly poor (Z-score -1.2), both suggesting general distress that frequently co-occurs with higher perceived stress. Physiologically, the analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveals sustained periods of elevated cardiovascular arousal during waking hours, particularly pronounced in the late morning (12-1 PM) and evening (6-8 PM), with Z-scores exceeding 1.0 during these times. These objective physiological responses could reflect an underlying state of heightened stress or reactivity, regardless of self-reported anxiety. Lifestyle factors such as higher-than-average alcohol consumption and a generally sedentary routine (despite sports engagement), coupled with a notably low BMI, may also contribute to or reflect underlying stress and potential health vulnerabilities.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**:
While the participant's self-reported levels of depression and trait anxiety are low, the overall pattern of data points more strongly towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The significant decline in GPA is a critical objective indicator of a major stressor. This is compounded by subjective reports of disturbed sleep, low happiness, and poor health satisfaction. The consistent and substantial physiological arousal observed in the hourly heart rate deviations suggests an underlying state of chronic activation that is not fully captured by the lower anxiety and depression scores. The discrepancy between low self-reported psychological distress and clear indicators of academic struggle, reduced well-being, and physiological arousal is compelling. This suggests that the participant may be experiencing significant perceived stress, but perhaps internalizing it or coping in ways that do not manifest as typical anxiety or depressive symptoms in self-report measures. The overall picture indicates a student grappling with substantial academic challenges and dissatisfaction, supported by objective physiological stress markers.

This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, sleep patterns, and physiological metrics to provide insights into a university student's psychological state and perceived stress.

### Psychological Traits and Mental Health
The participant generally reports a low burden of depressive symptoms, indicated by a CES-D score (Z = -0.76) that classifies them as ""Not depressed."" Subjective sleep quality is also rated as good, with a PSQI score (Z = -0.8) well within the range of healthy sleep. However, several other self-report measures suggest areas of psychological vulnerability. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI (Z = -0.13), is near the population average but is classified as ""anxious,"" implying a stable propensity for anxiety. Self-esteem is notably lower than the population mean (Z = -0.87), correlating negatively with perceived stress, which suggests a potential contributor to higher stress. Similarly, self-reported happiness (Z = -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z = -0.45) are both below average, and these lower scores are also associated with higher perceived stress. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows a declining trend from 3.8 to 3.37 over three semesters, which could serve as an additional stressor. The participant reports above-average trust in others (Z = 1.15).

### Lifestyle Behaviors
In terms of substance use, the participant reports complete abstinence from alcohol, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, indicating a healthy behavior in this domain. Exercise patterns are mixed: there is very low reported frequency of exercising alone or with others (Z = -1.18 and -1.58, respectively). However, the participant engages in sports at a high frequency (three times a week or more, Z = 1.58), suggesting a preference for structured or group-based physical activity as a primary form of exercise. Daily recreational habits reveal a significant lack of engagement in solitary, potentially calming activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, or reading. Conversely, the participant spends above-average time listening to music (Z = 1.13) and an average amount of time socializing with friends and using the internet. The absence of reading, specifically, has a notable negative correlation with PSS, suggesting its lack might contribute to higher stress.

### Sleep Patterns
Subjectively, the participant perceives their sleep quality as good (PSQI Z = -0.8). Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is below the population average (Z = -0.77). This shorter sleep duration is typically associated with increased perceived stress. While the variability in sleep duration is below average (Z = -0.79), indicating consistent nightly sleep lengths once sleep is initiated, the participant exhibits above-average variability in sleep start time (Z = 0.23). The median sleep start time is approximately 1:00 AM, and the high variability suggests inconsistent bedtimes. The greater variability in sleep start time positively correlates with perceived stress.

### Physiological Markers
Physiological data derived from wearable devices present a detailed picture of the participant's cardiovascular activity and circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits a below-average resting heart rate (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics show average interdaily stability and intradaily variability, but a slightly above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 0.48), suggesting a somewhat regular heart rate rhythm. However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is below average (Z = -0.39), which, given its negative correlation with PSS, suggests a blunted daily physiological fluctuation that may be linked to higher stress. The mesor (average heart rate across the day) is also below average (Z = -0.33).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. The lowest heart rates are consistently observed in the early morning hours (2-5 AM), reflecting nocturnal rest. A particularly notable finding is a significantly elevated heart rate deviation between 7-8 AM (Z = 1.9), indicating a pronounced physiological activation and arousal upon waking or commencing daily activities, compared to the population average for that specific hour. This early morning peak is followed by generally elevated heart rates throughout the day, with another relative peak in the mid-afternoon (2-3 PM), before gradually declining towards late evening. This prominent early morning physiological surge, in conjunction with other stress indicators, suggests a significant daily physiological demand or a heightened stress response during the start of the day.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Several factors suggest that the participant might experience lower-than-average perceived stress. The participant reports a low level of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = -0.76), and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = -0.8), both of which are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Physiologically, a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.42) indicates good cardiovascular health, and a lower resting heart rate correlates with lower PSS. The participant's high engagement in sports (Z-score = 1.58) acts as a positive coping mechanism, correlating negatively with PSS. Furthermore, the absence of alcohol and drug use removes potential stressors or maladaptive coping strategies. Objectively, sleep duration variability is low (Z-score = -0.79), suggesting consistent sleep lengths, and the 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate is above average (Z-score = 0.48), indicating a more regular circadian rhythm, both of which correlate with lower perceived stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, several indicators point towards an elevated level of perceived stress. Psychologically, the participant exhibits low self-esteem (Z-score = -0.87), below-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53), and lower health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.45). All three traits correlate negatively with PSS, meaning lower scores are associated with higher perceived stress. The classification of ""anxious"" on the STAI, even with a near-average score (Z-score = -0.13), suggests a stable predisposition to anxiety that likely contributes to perceived stress. The declining trend in GPA over recent semesters introduces an academic stressor. Behaviorally, a median sleep duration of 6 hours 34 minutes (Z-score = -0.77) is shorter than average and associated with higher stress. Additionally, the participant's sleep start time exhibits above-average variability (Z-score = 0.23), indicating irregular bedtimes, which correlates positively with higher PSS. The lack of engagement in solitary, potentially calming recreational activities like reading, which correlates negatively with PSS, also suggests a gap in stress-reducing behaviors. Physiologically, the blunted circadian heart rate amplitude (Z-score = -0.39), which correlates negatively with PSS, may indicate a less robust daily physiological rhythm associated with higher stress. Most significantly, a highly pronounced heart rate deviation from the mesor between 7-8 AM (Z-score = 1.9) indicates a substantial early morning physiological arousal that correlates positively with PSS, pointing to a strong daily stress response or high physiological demand.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates protective factors such as low depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep quality, a healthy resting heart rate, and strong engagement in sports, a broader analysis of the data suggests that these may not fully buffer the impact of other significant stressors. The convergence of psychological vulnerabilities, including low self-esteem, reduced happiness, and average trait anxiety, coupled with the documented decline in academic performance, points towards an underlying burden. The objective physiological data provides compelling evidence of heightened daily demands, particularly the substantial early morning heart rate surge, and a somewhat dysregulated sleep-wake pattern (variable sleep start times, shorter sleep duration). The lack of engagement in calming solitary activities further suggests a potential deficit in adaptive coping strategies for managing these stressors. Therefore, despite some positive health indicators, the overall profile indicates that the participant likely experiences perceived stress at a level higher than the population median.

71894,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates significant internal distress. Notably, scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) are highly elevated, with Z-scores of 2.15 and 2.24 respectively, placing them well above the study population mean for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. These measures also show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress (0.28 for CESD, 0.31 for STAI). Concurrently, self-esteem is markedly low (Z-score -2.7), satisfaction with physical health is considerably below average (Z-score -1.95), and self-reported happiness is also significantly reduced (Z-score -1.61). The negative correlations of these metrics with PSS suggest that lower self-esteem, health satisfaction, and happiness are associated with higher perceived stress. These findings collectively point to a participant experiencing a substantial psychological burden.

Sleep patterns, assessed through both self-report and wearable data, present a mixed picture. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicative of clinical significance, their PSQI Z-score of -0.33 suggests that this level of disturbance is not notably worse than the average for the study population. Objectively, wearable data shows a slightly shorter median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes (Z-score -0.58). However, the participant demonstrates relatively high consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 54 minutes, Z-score -1.06) and sleep start times (standard deviation of 58 minutes, Z-score -0.56), indicating a regular sleep schedule. The lower standard deviations for sleep duration and start time, both positively correlated with PSS, suggest that this consistency in sleep timing might serve as a protective factor against higher perceived stress. The participant also reports no daily napping.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a structured but somewhat elevated and blunted circadian rhythm in heart rate. The resting heart rate (63.6 bpm) and overall heart rate mesor (80.91 bpm) are slightly above the population average (Z-scores 0.65 and 0.95 respectively), with resting heart rate showing a weak positive correlation with PSS (0.14). The heart rate circadian rhythm exhibits above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.5) and particularly strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.48), indicating a consistent daily rhythm. However, the amplitude of this rhythm is below average (Z-score -0.75), suggesting less pronounced fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates, which, given its negative correlation with PSS (-0.17), might imply a reduced physiological adaptability or chronic activation associated with higher stress. Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z-score 0.81), further complicating the interpretation of daily physiological dynamics.

An examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlights specific periods of heightened physiological arousal. Most notably, there are exceptionally high deviations observed during the early morning hours, specifically between 6-7 AM (Z-score 4.44) and 7-8 AM (Z-score 4.61), with elevated arousal extending into 8-9 AM (Z-score 1.76). These extreme values suggest a very rapid and intense physiological activation period upon waking or early in the day, significantly above the typical patterns of their peers. While nocturnal heart rate drops are more pronounced than average in the initial hours of sleep (e.g., 12-1 AM Z-score -1.88), indicating potential recovery, the dramatic morning surge in heart rate suggests a significant physiological stress response or activation during the start of the day.

Behavioral habits reflect a balance of health-promoting activities and digitally-oriented recreation. Substance usage is minimal across all categories, with consumption well below the population average. The participant engages consistently in exercise, with above-average frequency for exercising alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 0.53). In terms of daily recreation, there is minimal engagement in passive media like TV/videos or video games. Conversely, the participant spends exceptionally high amounts of time on internet usage and listening to music (both Z-scores > 2.0). Socializing with friends is also a significant daily activity, above the population average (Z-score 1.74). The high internet usage has a weak positive correlation with PSS (0.11). While active, the high engagement in screen-based activities could contribute to or reflect aspects of their perceived stress experience.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The participant's self-reported psychological well-being metrics provide strong evidence for an elevated perceived stress level. The CESD score (34.0, Z-score 2.15) and STAI score (64.0, Z-score 2.24) are both substantially above the population mean, indicating significantly heightened depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, respectively. Both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31), directly linking them to higher perceived stress. Furthermore, exceptionally low self-esteem (Z-score -2.7) and reduced happiness (Z-score -1.61) are strongly associated with higher PSS due to their negative correlations (-0.15 and -0.19). Low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.95), also negatively correlated with PSS (-0.08), further contributes to this picture of elevated distress. Physiologically, the above-average resting heart rate (Z-score 0.65) and Mesor (Z-score 0.95), alongside the reduced amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-score -0.75, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.17), suggest a state of chronic physiological activation or reduced adaptability. The extreme peaks in hourly heart rate deviations during morning hours (Z-scores > 4.0 for 6-8 AM) indicate acute, high physiological arousal. The self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI > 5) also generally points towards higher stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several aspects of the participant's behavioral and physiological patterns suggest factors that might mitigate stress. The participant exhibits notable consistency in sleep patterns, with below-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score -1.06) and sleep start times (Z-score -0.56). Given the positive correlations of these metrics with PSS (0.14 and 0.17 respectively), lower variability in sleep is associated with lower perceived stress. Similarly, robust circadian rhythm regularity, indicated by above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.5) and significantly elevated 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score 1.48), with negative correlations to PSS (-0.12 and -0.17), suggests that a predictable daily physiological routine may be a buffer against stress. The participant also maintains consistent exercise habits and low substance use, which are generally associated with better well-being.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates beneficial consistency in sleep timing and circadian rhythms, alongside healthy exercise habits, the overwhelming evidence from self-reported psychological distress measures (CESD, STAI, self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) strongly indicates a high level of internal burden. These self-reported psychological states are highly elevated relative to the study population and correlate meaningfully with perceived stress. Furthermore, physiological indicators such as above-average resting heart rate and the dramatic morning heart rate peaks suggest significant physiological arousal that likely accompanies heightened stress. The blunted circadian amplitude also hints at reduced physiological resilience. Therefore, despite some protective behavioral and physiological regularities, the cumulative evidence points to a participant experiencing substantial perceived stress.

30453,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress and profound sleep disturbance, alongside indicators of physiological dysregulation, despite engagement in several positive health behaviors. Self-report data reveal substantial depressive symptomatology, with a CES-D score of 31.0 (Z-score: 1.84), classifying the participant as experiencing elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study population. Concurrently, trait anxiety is elevated, indicated by a STAI score of 51.0 (Z-score: 0.96). These measures, both positively correlated with perceived stress, suggest a heightened psychological burden. Further reinforcing this pattern, self-esteem is notably low (Score: 27.0, Z-score: -1.57), and self-reported happiness is significantly below average (Score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), with both measures negatively correlating with perceived stress, implying that lower values are associated with higher stress. Health satisfaction is also lower than average (Z-score: -1.11). These self-reported psychological states collectively point to a substantial level of subjective distress and diminished well-being.

Sleep quality and patterns represent a major area of concern for this participant. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is exceptionally high at 16.0 (Z-score: 4.29), indicating severe sleep disturbance, a factor strongly linked to perceived stress. Wearable data corroborates aspects of this disturbance, showing a slightly shorter median sleep duration of 6 hours 25 minutes (Z-score: -0.96) and a notably higher variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 145 minutes, Z-score: 1.0). While median sleep start time is 01:21:00, its variability is moderately higher (95 minutes, Z-score: 0.26). These objective measures complement the self-reported poor sleep quality, suggesting inconsistent and potentially insufficient sleep.

Physiological data derived from heart rate metrics further reveal patterns of potential dysregulation. The participant exhibits lower interdaily stability (0.3, Z-score: -0.9) and higher intradaily variability (0.63, Z-score: 0.6) in heart rate, suggesting less regular and more fragmented daily physiological rhythms, both of which correlate with perceived stress. The average heart rate (Mesor) is elevated at 80.18 bpm (Z-score: 0.85), as is the resting heart rate (67.5 bpm, Z-score: 1.11), both positively correlated with perceived stress. Heart rate amplitude is lower than average (8.82, Z-score: -0.63), indicating a reduced range of heart rate fluctuation throughout the day, which negatively correlates with perceived stress. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals particularly elevated heart rates during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 6-7 AM, Z-score: 1.53; 7-8 AM, Z-score: 1.08), which are typically periods of lower physiological activity or awakening. These elevated heart rates during what should be a recovery phase, coupled with positive correlations to PSS, suggest sustained physiological arousal or interrupted sleep, aligning with the severe sleep disturbance indicated by the PSQI.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates a positive engagement in physical activity and certain recreational pursuits, with no reported substance use. The participant exercises frequently with others (Z-score: 1.23) and participates in sports three or more times a week (Z-score: 1.58). Both exercising with others and playing sports have negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting these activities may serve as protective factors or coping mechanisms. Similarly, the participant engages significantly in listening to music (Z-score: 2.06) and reading (Z-score: 2.28), with reading demonstrating a strong negative correlation with perceived stress. These positive and health-promoting behaviors stand in contrast to the observed psychological distress and physiological dysregulation, indicating that the participant actively employs constructive coping strategies, even while experiencing significant internal challenges.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The evidence strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level is likely in the top 50th percentile of the study population. Multiple self-reported measures of psychological distress are significantly elevated and are positively correlated with perceived stress. This includes substantial depressive symptoms (CESD score 31.0, Z-score 1.84, correlation 0.28) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 51.0, Z-score 0.96, correlation 0.31). Furthermore, self-esteem is significantly low (Z-score -1.57) and happiness is markedly below average (Z-score -1.61), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, meaning lower values are associated with higher perceived stress. The most striking evidence comes from the profound self-reported sleep disturbance, with a PSQI score of 16.0 (Z-score 4.29), an exceptionally high value indicative of severe sleep problems. This is supported by wearable data showing reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and increased intradaily variability (Z-score 0.6) in heart rate, both linked to higher PSS. Physiological indicators of elevated arousal are also present, including a higher resting heart rate (Z-score 1.11) and Mesor heart rate (Z-score 0.85), alongside sustained elevated heart rates during typical sleep hours, all positively correlated with PSS. These combined factors present a profile of significant psychological and physiological strain that would typically translate to high perceived stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score is primarily found in the participant's engagement in positive health behaviors. The participant reports no substance usage (e.g., alcohol, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), with most substance use metrics having negative Z-scores, indicating lower than average use. Significantly, the participant is highly engaged in physical activity, exercising with others (Z-score 1.23) and participating in sports (Z-score 1.58) frequently. Both of these exercise habits are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting they act as beneficial coping mechanisms. Similarly, high engagement in reading (Z-score 2.28) and listening to music (Z-score 2.06) are noted, with reading showing a relatively strong negative correlation with PSS. These behaviors generally contribute to well-being and stress reduction. These positive coping strategies might mitigate perceived stress to some extent, but their impact must be weighed against the substantial indicators of distress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits notable strengths in adopting positive health behaviors such as frequent exercise and engagement in reading and music, these appear insufficient to offset the pervasive psychological distress and severe sleep disturbance observed. The exceptionally high PSQI score (Z-score 4.29) alone is a powerful indicator of significant distress. Coupled with highly elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, significantly low self-esteem and happiness, and objective physiological markers of dysregulation (elevated RHR, fragmented circadian rhythm, elevated heart rate during sleep), the overall profile points towards a considerably high level of perceived stress. The strong correlations of these distress indicators with PSS further strengthen this interpretation. Therefore, despite commendable coping efforts, the participant's overall perceived stress level is highly likely to fall within the top half of the study population distribution.

66047,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The participant's data reveals a comprehensive pattern of psychological distress, disturbed sleep, elevated physiological arousal, and a sedentary lifestyle, which together indicate a high level of perceived stress.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a pronounced pattern of psychological distress, as evidenced by multiple self-report measures. Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) are notably high (46.0, Z=3.4), indicating significant depressive symptom burden, a finding strongly positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28). Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait) score is also very high (73.0, Z=3.13), reflecting elevated chronic anxiety proneness, which also shows a strong positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31). This psychological profile is further supported by significantly low self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 21.0, Z=-2.42), low self-reported happiness (score 2.0, Z=-1.61), and very low satisfaction with physical health (score 1.22, Z=-2.28). These indicators collectively suggest a substantial level of subjective psychological burden and reduced overall well-being.

Sleep patterns reveal a mix of objective consistency and subjective disturbance. While the median sleep duration is average (7 hours 15 minutes, Z=0.08), the participant's subjective sleep quality is notably poor, indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z=1.52), signifying clinically significant sleep disturbance. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is exceptionally late (02:40:59), suggesting a significantly delayed sleep-wake schedule. A high mean daily napping frequency (0.28 naps per day, Z=2.4) is significantly elevated compared to the population, potentially indicating fragmented nocturnal sleep or an attempt to compensate for sleep deficits, a factor positively correlated with perceived stress (0.13).

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics suggest a state of elevated baseline arousal and a potentially shifted circadian rhythm. The participant's resting heart rate (68.4 bpm, Z=1.22) and heart rate mesor (80.2 bpm, Z=0.85) are both above average, reflecting a generally higher physiological baseline. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day (6:35 PM). Hourly deviations from the mesor indicate heart rates above average during the early morning hours (12-2 AM), which could be indicative of late activity or nocturnal physiological arousal, especially considering these are typically periods of sleep onset or deep sleep. Subsequently, heart rates drop significantly to their lowest points during typical morning sleep hours (4-8 AM). The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is slightly below average (Z=-0.31), which might imply a somewhat blunted physiological response range. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability of heart rate are close to the population average, suggesting typical regularity in these aspects despite the elevated physiological baseline.

The participant's behavioral habits are predominantly sedentary and characterized by a reliance on passive forms of recreation. There is very high engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (more than 4 hours, Z=3.17) and internet usage (more than 4 hours, Z=2.19). In contrast, engagement in physical exercise is extremely low across all categories, including exercising alone (Z=-1.18), exercising with others (Z=-1.58), and sports (Z=-1.09). Participation in other leisure activities such as video games, listening to music, and reading is reported as ""Do not do."" Socializing with friends falls within the average range. Substance use is minimal. This profile suggests a lifestyle largely devoid of physical activity and diverse, active recreational pursuits, which may contribute to the observed psychological distress and physiological arousal.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The participant's data presents a robust pattern indicative of significantly elevated perceived stress. The most compelling evidence arises from self-reported psychological measures: the participant scored extremely high on the CESD (Z=3.4) and STAI-Trait (Z=3.13), indicating profound depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively. Both of these measures exhibit strong positive correlations with perceived stress. Furthermore, self-esteem (Z=-2.42), current happiness (Z=-1.61), and health satisfaction (Z=-2.28) are all notably low, and these are negatively correlated with PSS, reinforcing the picture of poor overall well-being. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI Z=1.52), and objective sleep metrics show a markedly late median sleep start time (02:40:59) coupled with a significantly high frequency of napping (Z=2.4), which is positively correlated with PSS and often signifies underlying stress or sleep disturbance. Physiologically, both resting heart rate (Z=1.22) and heart rate mesor (Z=0.85) are elevated, suggesting a heightened state of physiological arousal, with positive correlations to PSS. Finally, the participant's highly sedentary lifestyle and minimal engagement in physical activity are behavioral patterns frequently associated with increased stress and poorer mental health.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a lower or median PSS score is limited and, where present, generally weak in its association with perceived stress. The participant reports minimal substance usage, which is typically associated with lower stress levels. Median sleep duration is average (7 hours 15 minutes, Z=0.08), which, in isolation, might suggest adequate sleep quantity, though subjective quality is poor. Circadian rhythm metrics for interdaily stability (Z=0.17) and intradaily variability (Z=0.24) are close to population averages. Interdaily stability is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12), implying that average stability might weakly indicate lower stress. Similarly, autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z=-0.28) and amplitude (Z=-0.31) are slightly below average and also negatively correlated with PSS (-0.17 for both). However, these correlations are relatively weak and potentially counter-intuitive given the overall elevated physiological arousal observed.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
A holistic review of the multimodal data strongly indicates that the participant’s perceived stress level falls within the top half of the study population. The overwhelming evidence for high stress comes from the extreme scores on measures of depression and anxiety, coupled with very low self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, all of which are strongly aligned with elevated perceived stress. This is further supported by significant subjective sleep disturbance, a notably delayed sleep schedule, elevated physiological arousal as indicated by resting and mesor heart rate, and a lifestyle characterized by extreme sedentarism and a lack of physical activity. While a few metrics (e.g., average total sleep duration, low substance use) might subtly suggest otherwise, their collective weight is vastly overshadowed by the extensive and convergent indicators of high stress and distress. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant experiences a level of perceived stress well above the median for the student population.

79834,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by generally stable psychological traits in specific domains, juxtaposed with potentially maladaptive behavioral patterns and objective physiological indicators suggesting underlying stress. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with GPAs ranging from 3.8 to 4.0, suggesting strong academic coping or achievement. Self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD score 8.0, Z-score -0.55) and trait anxiety (STAI score 37.0, Z-score -0.43) are both below the population average, indicating a relatively low burden in these specific psychological areas. However, other self-reported aspects of well-being are less favorable; happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53), and self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17). A particularly notable psychological trait is significantly low trust (Z-score -1.42) compared to the study population, which could influence social interactions and perceived threat. Conversely, satisfaction with physical health is above average (Z-score 0.55).

Behaviorally, the participant presents a concerning pattern of low engagement in beneficial health-promoting activities and an elevated reliance on alcohol. Exercise frequency is markedly low across all categories (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.18, Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58, Sports Z-score -1.09), indicating a largely sedentary lifestyle. Concurrently, wine or liquor consumption is significantly above the population average (""Three times a week or more"", Z-score 1.68), while usage of other substances is low or non-existent. Recreational habits are limited, with below-average engagement in reading, video games, music listening, and sedentary hobbies, suggesting that alcohol consumption might serve as a primary leisure activity or coping mechanism in the absence of other outlets. Socializing with friends and internet usage are around population averages.

Sleep patterns reveal a critical discrepancy between objective duration and subjective quality. Fitbit data indicates significantly above-average median sleep duration (8 hours 18 minutes, Z-score 1.39) and notable consistency in sleep duration and start times (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score -0.35, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score -0.68). The median sleep start time is late (00:46:30) but consistent. In stark contrast to these objective metrics, the participant reports ""disturbed sleep"" as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, which typically signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance. This discordance suggests that despite achieving ample and regular sleep, the subjective experience of sleep quality is poor, potentially impacting restorative processes.

Physiological data from heart rate monitoring reflects a regular but potentially aroused pattern. The circadian rhythm is characterized by above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.64) and amplitude (Z-score 0.56), indicating a clear and consistent daily physiological cycle. Intradaily variability is below average (Z-score -0.95), which, combined with low exercise, might suggest a relatively stable but less dynamic heart rate throughout the day. The Mesor (average heart rate) and Resting Heart Rate (52.9 bpm, Z-score -0.62) are both below average, generally considered favorable indicators of cardiovascular health. However, the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show a pronounced and sustained elevation well above the Mesor into the evening hours, peaking at 6-7 PM (+20.36 from Mesor) and again at 9-10 PM (+17.24 from Mesor). The acrophase, or peak heart rate, is at 5:23 PM. This prolonged physiological arousal in the late afternoon and evening, extending close to the participant's consistent late bedtime, could contribute to the reported subjective sleep disturbance, potentially indicative of difficulty in physiological and psychological wind-down.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's perceived stress level (PSS) falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we synthesize evidence from multiple domains. The population PSS has a median of 22.0, with the bottom 50% being scores of 22.0 or lower, and the top 50% being scores above 22.0.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant reports below-average levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.55) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43). Both of these measures have positive, albeit weak, correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31 respectively), suggesting that lower scores on CESD and STAI would correspond to lower PSS. Additionally, the participant maintains a high GPA, which could be a source of confidence and reduced academic stress. Objectively, the participant exhibits a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.62) and above-average sleep duration (8 hours 18 minutes, Z-score 1.39) with low variability in sleep duration and start times. These physiological and objective sleep patterns are generally associated with better health and potentially lower stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Despite objective measures of ample sleep duration, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 6.0), which exceeds the clinical threshold for significant sleep disturbance. Poor subjective sleep quality is a strong correlate of increased perceived stress. Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates significantly high alcohol consumption (wine/liquor Z-score 1.68) and very low engagement in physical exercise (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.18, Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58). These behaviors can act as either coping mechanisms for stress or contribute to higher stress due to their health implications and lack of stress-reducing alternatives. Psychologically, the participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53), slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.17), and notably low trust (Z-score -1.42). These factors, particularly low happiness and trust, are commonly associated with higher levels of perceived stress. Physiologically, the sustained elevation of heart rate into the late evening, with peaks around 6-7 PM and 9-10 PM, indicates prolonged physiological arousal which could interfere with relaxation and contribute to the subjective experience of disturbed sleep and overall perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits resilience in core anxiety and depressive symptom domains and maintains strong academic performance, the evidence collectively points towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The most compelling indicators are the significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI score of 6.0) despite objectively long sleep, coupled with physiological arousal extending late into the evening. These suggest a difficulty in mental and physiological unwinding, a hallmark of chronic stress. Furthermore, the reliance on high alcohol consumption and the extreme lack of physical exercise are maladaptive behavioral patterns often associated with managing or responding to stress. The below-average happiness, self-esteem, and significantly low trust provide a psychological context that further supports a higher stress profile. Given the confluence of these factors, particularly the clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance and the concerning behavioral coping mechanisms, it is most likely that the participant experiences perceived stress levels placing them in the upper half of the study population.

33133,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notable pattern of elevated psychological distress and disturbed sleep, strongly correlating with potential perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score of 31.0, Z-score 1.84) and higher-than-average trait anxiety (STAI score of 49.0, Z-score 0.76), both of which show positive correlations with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.17), below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53), and lower trust in others (Z-score -0.78), further suggesting a more negative affective and social orientation, though health satisfaction is reported as above average (Z-score 0.8). These self-reported psychological states present a profile indicative of internal struggle and emotional burden.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates moderate substance use, consuming beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while abstaining from recreational and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity is relatively high, with frequent exercise alone (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) and participation in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91), though there is a marked absence of exercise with others (Z-score -1.58). This suggests a preference for solitary physical activity. Daily recreational habits are characterized by extensive internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.52), while engagement in activities like reading, video games, and watching TV/movies is notably low. Despite strong academic performance, as evidenced by recent GPAs, the overall lifestyle suggests a potentially isolated leisure pattern combined with high digital engagement.

Sleep patterns are a significant area of concern for this participant. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0 (Z-score 1.98) indicates severely disturbed subjective sleep quality, a factor strongly correlated with perceived stress. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 38 minutes (Z-score -0.68), placing the participant below the population average for sleep duration. While sleep duration consistency is high (lower standard deviation, Z-score -0.85), there is slightly above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.39). The participant also engages in a slightly elevated frequency of napping (Z-score 0.21), which could be a compensatory mechanism for insufficient nocturnal sleep. The confluence of self-reported poor sleep and objectively short and somewhat variable sleep patterns is a key indicator of impaired recovery and potentially increased vulnerability to stress.

Physiological data derived from heart rate further illuminates patterns of arousal and circadian rhythm. The participant's resting heart rate and MESOR are near the population average, not inherently indicative of chronic physiological stress. However, there is a slightly lower-than-average amplitude in daily heart rate variation (Z-score -0.22) and an elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.6), the latter positively correlated with PSS. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:25 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveals significant physiological arousal during specific periods. Notably, there is a very sharp increase in heart rate activity in the morning (8-9 AM, Z-score 2.09), far exceeding the population mean, suggesting a highly activated or stressful start to the day. Furthermore, heart rate remains elevated above the MESOR into the late evening hours (10-11 PM, Z-score 0.87; 11-12 AM, Z-score 0.77), indicating sustained physiological activation that could impede relaxation and sleep onset. This pattern of heightened arousal, particularly at the beginning and end of the day, points towards a physiological state consistent with elevated perceived stress.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analysis of the multimodal data provides substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The most compelling indicators come from self-reported psychological and sleep measures. The participant's CESD score (31.0, Z-score 1.84, correlation 0.28) and STAI score (49.0, Z-score 0.76, correlation 0.31) are significantly elevated, classifying them as experiencing depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. Both of these constructs are positively and meaningfully correlated with PSS scores. Similarly, the PSQI score (11.0, Z-score 1.98, correlation 0.28) indicates severely disturbed sleep, which is a strong predictor of higher perceived stress. These three self-report measures alone represent a substantial burden of psychological and sleep-related distress.

Further support is found in the wearable data. The participant exhibits higher-than-average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.6, correlation 0.16), suggesting less stable physiological states throughout the day, which positively correlates with PSS. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show a pronounced physiological arousal in the morning (8-9 AM, Z-score 2.09), indicating a significantly activated state compared to peers. Elevated heart rate also persists late into the evening (10-11 PM, Z-score 0.87; 11-12 AM, Z-score 0.77), potentially hindering relaxation and contributing to sleep disturbances reported via PSQI. These physiological patterns align with a heightened stress response. Additionally, lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.19) and objectively shorter median sleep duration (Z-score -0.68) contribute to a profile consistent with elevated perceived stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Less evidence supports a low or median PSS score. The participant's self-esteem is only slightly below average (Z-score -0.17) and health satisfaction is above average (Z-score 0.8), though the correlations with PSS for these metrics are weak or negligible. Resting heart rate and MESOR are near the population mean, which might suggest a baseline cardiovascular state that is not chronically elevated. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score -0.22, correlation -0.17), which could imply less extreme physiological swings, but this is overshadowed by other arousal indicators. Consistent sleep duration (lower standard deviation, Z-score -0.85) could be interpreted positively, but this is consistency at a low total duration. High exercise frequency could be a stress-mitigating factor, but does not negate the significant distress observed elsewhere.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
The overwhelming evidence points towards a participant experiencing considerable psychological and physiological strain. The high scores on CESD, STAI, and PSQI, all strongly correlated with perceived stress, combined with objective patterns of physiological arousal during waking hours and insufficient sleep, are compelling indicators of elevated perceived stress. While some factors like exercise and academic performance might suggest coping resources or functional domains, they do not mitigate the pervasive signs of distress. Therefore, the participant is highly likely to fall into the top 50% of the study population distribution with regard to their PSS score.

47810,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by a generally stable psychological disposition alongside significant indicators of physiological dysregulation and disturbed sleep, which likely contribute to perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a relatively low trait anxiety level (STAI Z-score = -0.43) and slightly above-average self-esteem (Z-score = 0.11), both typically associated with lower perceived stress. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, are within a non-clinical range (Z-score = 0.18). The participant also demonstrates strong academic performance, maintaining a consistent high GPA. However, subjective well-being is somewhat compromised, with self-reported happiness being below the population average (Z-score = -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health notably low (Z-score = -0.70). These reduced subjective well-being indicators generally correlate with higher levels of perceived stress.

A prominent and consistent pattern across the data highlights significant sleep disturbance and circadian rhythm dysregulation. The participant reported a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0, placing them more than one standard deviation above the population mean (Z-score = 1.05) and classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" Objective Fitbit data further supports this, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours 40 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score = -0.65), and a late median sleep start time of 01:26:30. A particularly striking finding is the exceptionally high frequency of daily naps (Z-score = 2.34), more than two standard deviations above the mean, strongly suggesting chronic daytime fatigue and an attempt to compensate for insufficient or poor-quality nighttime sleep. This elevated napping frequency positively correlates with higher perceived stress. Wearable-derived circadian metrics reveal significant intradaily variability (IV) in heart rate, also more than two standard deviations above the mean (Z-score = 2.01). High IV signifies fragmented activity/rest cycles within a day, a robust indicator of physiological dysregulation and a pattern positively correlated with perceived stress. Additionally, lower autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -0.95) suggests less robust daily periodicity in their physiological rhythms.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of notable physiological arousal extending late into the evening. While the participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.22), suggesting good baseline cardiovascular fitness, and the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is moderately robust (Z-score = 0.52), there are sustained elevations in heart rate throughout the day and evening. Specifically, heart rates show significant elevations from 11 AM to 12 PM (Z-score = 1.27) and reach their highest peaks between 6 PM and 9 PM (Z-scores of 1.09, 0.99, and 1.16, respectively). These pronounced and prolonged periods of elevated heart rate, particularly in the evening, suggest sustained physiological activation that could interfere with the winding-down process necessary for restorative sleep, exacerbating the already identified sleep disturbances.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates healthy engagement in physical activity, exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports (with sports frequency being notably above average, Z-score = 0.91). Substance use is minimal, aside from moderate wine/liquor consumption (Z-score = 0.94). However, engagement in various recreational activities that might provide relaxation or social support appears limited. The participant reports abstaining from common leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies, often with negative Z-scores relative to the population. Socializing with friends is also reported below average (Z-score = -0.62). While avoiding excessive screen time can be beneficial, the limited engagement in diverse recreational and social activities, particularly reading (which correlates negatively with PSS), might reduce opportunities for effective stress recovery and contribute to the reported lower happiness and health satisfaction.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several factors commonly associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score) is below the population average, and self-esteem is slightly above average, both of which correlate negatively with perceived stress in the study population. Objectively, their resting heart rate is slightly below average, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The amplitude of their heart rate circadian rhythm is moderately above average, suggesting a robust physiological rhythm, which also correlates negatively with PSS. Furthermore, the participant maintains strong academic performance and engages in regular exercise, particularly sports, which tends to correlate with lower stress. Substance use is generally low.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, there is substantial and consistent evidence pointing towards elevated perceived stress. The most prominent indicators are related to sleep and physiological dysregulation. The participant's PSQI score classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Z-score = 1.05), a strong indicator of poor sleep quality, which is intrinsically linked to stress. Objectively, median sleep duration is below average, and there is an exceptionally high frequency of daily naps (Z-score = 2.34), suggesting chronic sleep debt and daytime fatigue, a factor that positively correlates with higher PSS. Wearable data reveals a very high intradaily variability (IV) in heart rate (Z-score = 2.01), signifying fragmented physiological rhythms, which has a positive correlation with PSS. Additionally, lower 24-hour autocorrelation suggests less stable daily rhythms. Heart rate data also shows prolonged periods of elevated physiological arousal, particularly high peaks in the late evening (6-9 PM), which can disrupt sleep and maintain a state of vigilance. Subjectively, the participant reports below-average happiness and satisfaction with physical health, both of which correlate negatively with PSS, implying a higher PSS score. Limited engagement in diverse recreational and social activities, such as reading, further removes potential coping mechanisms for stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant possesses protective psychological traits and healthy exercise habits that could buffer against stress, the cumulative evidence of significant sleep disturbance and physiological dysregulation is compelling and points towards elevated perceived stress. The magnitude of the Z-scores for PSQI, daily naps, and intradaily variability, all strongly indicative of dysregulation and poor recovery, combined with subjective reports of lower happiness and health satisfaction, outweighs the beneficial aspects. The sustained physiological arousal observed in the evening heart rate patterns further compounds the issue of disturbed sleep, creating a cycle that is highly characteristic of chronic stress. Therefore, despite some positive indicators, the overall pattern of physiological and behavioral disruption strongly suggests that the participant is experiencing elevated levels of perceived stress.

58196,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The participant presents with a notably strong psychological profile, characterized by low self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, high self-esteem, and elevated happiness. Specifically, the participant scored well below the population mean on both the CES-D (Z-score: -0.76) and STAI-Trait (Z-score: -1.02) scales, indicating a minimal burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. These low scores are consistent with a lower perceived stress level, as both scales exhibit positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.32). Furthermore, self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1) and current happiness (Z-score: 1.64) are considerably above the population average, and their negative correlations with PSS (-0.16 and -0.19) suggest these strengths serve as protective factors against stress. High satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: 1.38) further reinforces this positive psychological state. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with a GPA ranging from 3.75 to 4.0, suggesting effective management of academic demands.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a highly active lifestyle with frequent engagement in exercise, both alone and with others, at rates above the population average (Z-scores: 1.07 and 1.23, respectively). This consistent physical activity is generally associated with enhanced stress resilience. In terms of substance use, alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor) is reported at '1-2 times a week,' placing the participant above the population mean (Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is entirely absent. A notable aspect of the participant's daily routine is minimal engagement in sedentary recreational activities; they report 'do not do' for watching TV/videos/movies, reading, and sedentary hobbies, and very low internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.16). This pattern suggests either a highly focused and productive routine or a lack of engagement in typical relaxation activities.

The participant’s sleep profile presents a blend of strengths and potential areas of concern. Objectively, as derived from wearable data, the median sleep duration is 6 hours 33 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score: -0.79). The median sleep start time is relatively late at 1:01 AM. However, the participant demonstrates good consistency in sleep patterns, with below-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.42) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.24). Despite the shorter objective sleep duration, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score: -1.26) indicates subjectively 'Good Sleep,' suggesting the participant perceives their sleep as restorative. The participant also engages in above-average napping (Z-score: 0.94), which may compensate for shorter nighttime sleep.

Physiological data from heart rate metrics reveal good overall cardiovascular health alongside some indicators of less robust circadian rhythmicity. The participant's Resting Heart Rate (53.4 bpm) and Mesor (66.57) are both below the population average (Z-scores: -0.56 and -1.01, respectively), which generally reflects good fitness. However, circadian rhythm parameters show lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.57) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.87), coupled with higher intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.81), indicating a less regular and more fragmented heart rate rhythm throughout the day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also below average (Z-score: -0.63), suggesting a less pronounced diurnal variation. Examination of the mean aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor highlights sustained physiological activity into the late evening, with heart rate remaining elevated significantly above the Mesor at 9-10 PM (deviation of 13.57, Z-score: 0.96) before declining. This sustained evening arousal could contribute to the observed higher intradaily variability and potentially impact restorative processes, despite the subjective report of good sleep quality.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Based on a holistic analysis of the available data, the participant’s overall perceived stress level (PSS score) is likely to place them in the **bottom half** of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):
The most compelling evidence stems from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02). Both of these scales show positive correlations with PSS, meaning lower scores indicate lower perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1) and high happiness (Z-score: 1.64), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, further supporting a lower stress perception. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (Z-score: -1.26), is reported as 'Good Sleep', which aligns with lower perceived stress, despite objective discrepancies. Furthermore, consistent engagement in frequent exercise, a well-established stress-reduction behavior, provides a behavioral buffer. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate and Mesor indicate good cardiovascular health, which is generally associated with better stress resilience.

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):
Some objective measures suggest potential physiological and behavioral patterns that *could* be associated with higher stress, though they are less directly indicative of *perceived* stress. The participant's objective sleep duration is below average (6 hours 33 minutes), and their circadian heart rate rhythm displays lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability, suggesting less physiological regularity. The elevated heart rate extending into the late evening (9-10 PM) could indicate prolonged arousal or activity before sleep. Above-average alcohol consumption, while weakly correlated with PSS in this dataset, is generally not considered a healthy coping mechanism for stress. However, these objective and behavioral metrics are largely counterbalanced by the participant's strong subjective well-being and positive mental health indicators. The PSS explicitly measures *perceived* stress, and the participant's self-reports on anxiety, depression, happiness, and health satisfaction strongly point towards a positive subjective experience.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
While there are subtle physiological and objective sleep patterns (e.g., shorter sleep, less regular circadian rhythms, late evening arousal) that might suggest underlying strain, the overwhelming majority of the self-reported psychological data—which is most directly relevant to the PSS as a measure of perceived stress—indicates a profile resilient to stress. The participant reports low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, happiness, and good subjective sleep quality. These strong protective factors and positive mental health indicators, combined with consistent exercise, strongly suggest the participant perceives their stress levels as manageable and relatively low compared to their peers.

Specifically, the participant's CES-D score of 4.0 (Z-score -0.97) indicates they are not classified as depressed within the study population. Similarly, their STAI-Trait score of 33.0 (Z-score -0.82) suggests lower chronic anxiety compared to peers. Concurrently, self-esteem (score 45.0, Z-Score 0.96) is notably above average, and overall health satisfaction (score 5.11, Z-score 0.63) is elevated. While current happiness (score 3.0, Z-Score -0.53) is slightly below the population mean, this deviation is minor and does not significantly detract from the overall pattern of positive mental well-being indicators observed across other psychological measures.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle, reporting engagement in exercise alone 'Three times a week or more' (Z-Score 1.07), exercising with others '1-2 times a week' (Z-Score 0.53), and participation in sports '1-2 times a week' (Z-Score 0.91). These exercise frequencies are consistently above the population average. In contrast, time spent on passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score -1.25) and listening to music (Z-Score -1.19) is substantially below average. This active engagement, coupled with sustained high academic performance (GPA consistently at or above 3.74, increasing to 3.9), suggests a disciplined and productive daily routine. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer (Z-Score 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-Score 0.94), is reported at levels above the population average, though correlations with perceived stress are negligible. The participant reports no usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits several indicators of robust health and regularity. Self-reported sleep quality is excellent, with a PSQI score of 3.0 (Z-Score -1.72) indicating ""Good Sleep."" Objective sleep data from the wearable device supports this, showing an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours 39 minutes (Z-Score 0.59) and significantly less variable sleep duration (standard deviation of 65 minutes, Z-Score -0.82) compared to the population. The resting heart rate of 57.0 beats per minute (Z-Score -0.14) is healthy and slightly below the population average, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis further highlights a stable daily physiological pattern, with an average Interdaily Stability (Z-Score 0.25) and remarkably low Intradaily Variability (Z-Score -1.59), suggesting a consistent internal physiological routine throughout the day. The mean aggregate heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates a healthy diurnal rhythm, with heart rate dropping significantly below the mesor during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -23.21 bpm at 5-6 AM) and rising considerably during daytime activity, peaking around 2-3 PM (+14.47 bpm, Z-Score 1.37). This robust amplitude (Z-Score 0.47) and predictable fluctuation reflect an adaptive physiological system capable of both significant arousal and deep recovery.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To evaluate the participant's perceived stress level, the available evidence is analyzed for indicators suggestive of either a low/median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) or a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) relative to the study population. The population's 50th percentile PSS score is 22.0.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

The majority of psychological, behavioral, and physiological data points strongly suggest a lower perceived stress level for this participant. Self-reported measures of psychological well-being are particularly compelling: the participant exhibits significantly lower depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.97, positive correlation with PSS 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.82, positive correlation with PSS 0.31). Both of these scores, being below average, indicate a reduced likelihood of high perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports notably high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), which has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.15), further supporting lower stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in an exceptionally high level of physical activity (multiple exercise metrics with Z-scores > 0.90), a known buffer against stress. Academically, consistent high GPA suggests effective management of academic pressures. Physiologically, excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.72) is corroborated by objective data showing above-average sleep duration (Z-score 0.59) and highly consistent sleep duration (sleep duration standard deviation Z-score -0.82, which correlates positively with PSS, meaning lower variability implies lower PSS). A healthy resting heart rate (57.0 bpm, Z-score -0.14) and robust heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.47, negative correlation with PSS -0.17) reflect good cardiovascular health and a well-regulated stress response system. The remarkably low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score -1.59, positive correlation with PSS 0.16) indicates a highly stable physiological rhythm, also associated with lower perceived stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

There is very limited evidence to suggest a high PSS score. The participant's self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) is slightly below average, and happiness has a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.19), implying a minor potential contribution to slightly elevated stress. Alcohol consumption, while above average, shows negligible correlation with PSS (-0.05 for beer, 0.03 for wine/liquor), suggesting it is not a significant driver of perceived stress in this individual's context. No other salient features indicate an elevated PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The comprehensive multimodal analysis consistently reveals a profile strongly indicative of low perceived stress. The participant demonstrates psychological resilience through low anxiety and depression, coupled with high self-esteem. Their lifestyle is characterized by high physical activity and excellent sleep hygiene, which are critical protective factors against stress. Physiologically, robust and consistent circadian rhythms, a healthy resting heart rate, and strong physiological responsiveness (heart rate amplitude) collectively point to a well-regulated and adaptive system. The few minor indicators that might slightly elevate PSS (e.g., slightly lower happiness) are overwhelmingly outweighed by numerous, more impactful indicators that strongly correlate with lower perceived stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's overall perceived stress level falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

55424,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This analysis integrates self-reported psychological measures, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological data to provide a comprehensive profile of the participant's psychological state and perceived stress.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a pronounced pattern of psychological distress, as evidenced by multiple self-report measures. Depressive symptoms, assessed by the CES-D, are highly elevated with a score of 35.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 2.26, classifying the participant as ""Depressed"" relative to the study population. Similarly, trait anxiety, measured by the STAI, is significantly elevated at a score of 57.0 (Z-score 1.55), classified as ""anxious."" Concurrently, self-reported happiness is notably low (Z-score -1.61), and self-esteem is somewhat below the population average (Z-score -0.87). These psychological indicators collectively suggest a substantial burden of internalizing symptoms. Despite these challenges, the participant demonstrates high academic performance, maintaining a GPA consistently above 3.8 across several semesters, which may reflect strong coping mechanisms or high functioning in specific domains. Engagement in social exercise is also notably high (Z-score 1.23), potentially serving as a positive coping strategy, while substance use is generally low. However, daily recreational habits indicate a preference for passive leisure, such as watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies (both above average Z-scores), with less engagement in other social or intellectually stimulating activities like reading.

Sleep quality presents a significant area of concern, with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 14.0 (Z-score 3.37) indicating severely disturbed subjective sleep quality. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.27) and generally considered adequate. Furthermore, sleep duration and sleep start times show greater consistency than the population average (negative Z-scores for standard deviations of sleep duration and start time). However, this objective consistency in duration and timing contrasts sharply with the self-reported poor sleep quality, suggesting that while the participant adheres to a regular sleep schedule, the restorative quality of sleep may be compromised. The participant also reports significantly more daily napping than average (Z-score 1.9), which may be a compensatory behavior for poor nocturnal sleep quality or daytime fatigue.

Physiological data from heart rate further illuminates the participant's daily patterns of arousal. The overall circadian rhythm, as derived from heart rate, appears generally stable, with average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score 0.34), indicating a robust daily fluctuation, with an acrophase (peak activity) occurring in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM). The mean aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a typical diurnal pattern: lowest heart rates during the early morning hours, gradually rising through the morning. A notable increase in heart rate deviation is observed in the late afternoon and early evening, peaking around 7-8 PM at nearly 20 beats per minute above the mesor (Z-score 1.44), indicating a period of heightened physiological activity or arousal during this time. This is followed by a sharp decline in heart rate deviation into the night, returning to below-mesor levels. The relatively low intradaily variability (Z-score -0.46) suggests a smoother, less fluctuating physiological profile throughout the day compared to peers, potentially reflecting a consistent daily routine or a dampened physiological responsiveness.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), would likely place them in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

*   **Elevated Depressive Symptoms (CES-D):** The participant's CES-D score of 35.0 (Z-score 2.26) is highly elevated and directly correlates positively with PSS (0.28). This strong indicator of depressive symptomatology is a significant predictor of higher perceived stress.
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI):** Similarly, the STAI score of 57.0 (Z-score 1.55) indicates high trait anxiety, which also correlates positively and strongly with PSS (0.31). Chronic anxiety is a core component of perceived stress.
*   **Low Happiness:** A self-reported happiness score of 2.0 (Z-score -1.61) is markedly low and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19), indicating that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress.
*   **Low Self-Esteem:** A self-esteem score of 32.0 (Z-score -0.87) is below average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15), suggesting that lower self-esteem contributes to higher perceived stress.
*   **Disturbed Sleep Quality (PSQI):** The PSQI score of 14.0 (Z-score 3.37) reflects severe subjective sleep disturbance. While not explicitly correlated with PSS in the provided data, poor sleep quality is a well-established consequence and contributor to high perceived stress. The significantly higher frequency of napping (Z-score 1.9), which has a positive correlation with PSS (0.13), further supports the presence of sleep-related distress.
*   **Physiological Arousal:** The pronounced peak in heart rate deviation from mesor during the early evening (e.g., 7-8 PM, Z-score 1.44) indicates periods of significant physiological activation, which, in the context of high self-reported psychological distress, could reflect heightened sympathetic nervous system activity associated with stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

*   **Consistent Sleep Patterns:** Objectively, the participant exhibits more consistent sleep duration (Z-score for SD = -0.72) and consistent sleep start times (Z-score for SD = -0.54). As higher variability in these metrics correlates positively with PSS, greater consistency would typically be associated with lower stress.
*   **High Academic Performance (GPA):** Consistent high GPA suggests effective management of academic demands, which can be a protective factor against stress in a university population.
*   **Health Satisfaction and Social Trust:** Scores for health satisfaction (Z-score 0.38) and trust (Z-score 0.18) are near or slightly above average, with slight negative correlations to PSS, indicating minor buffering effects.
*   **Circadian Rhythm Regularity:** Wearable metrics for interdaily stability, 24-hour autocorrelation, and amplitude are average to slightly above average, with mild negative correlations to PSS, suggesting generally robust circadian rhythms.
*   **Social Exercise:** The participant engages in social exercise more frequently than average (Z-score 1.23), a behavior often associated with stress reduction, though its correlation with PSS is very weak (-0.02).

**Holistic Analysis:**

While the participant demonstrates some resilient behaviors and physiological patterns, particularly in maintaining academic performance and consistent sleep timing, the magnitude of self-reported psychological distress (depression, anxiety, low happiness, low self-esteem, severely disturbed sleep quality) is exceptionally high. The Z-scores for CES-D (2.26) and STAI (1.55) are several standard deviations above the mean, and their correlations with PSS are positive and substantial. The self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 3.37) is also a very strong indicator of overall distress, despite objective consistency in sleep timing/duration. The objective sleep consistency and high GPA, while positive, are not sufficient to counteract the pervasive and strongly correlated indicators of internal psychological distress. Therefore, the combined evidence strongly points towards an elevated level of perceived stress.

23576,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a psychological and behavioral profile generally indicative of effective stress regulation, characterized by robust mental health traits, constructive lifestyle habits, and highly regular physiological rhythms. Psychologically, the participant reports notably lower levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 7.0, Z-score -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI score 34.0, Z-score -0.72) compared to the study population, both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem is significantly higher than average (RSES score 45.0, Z-score 0.96), a factor typically associated with lower stress. High satisfaction with physical health (score 5.22, Z-score 0.72) further supports a positive self-perception of well-being. However, a slightly lower than average self-reported happiness score (3.0, Z-score -0.53) presents a notable contrast, suggesting a potential area of subjective emotional experience that diverges from other positive psychological indicators.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly structured and health-promoting lifestyle. Academic performance is exceptional, with a consistent 4.0 GPA in recent semesters, implying strong academic coping or low academic stress. Substance usage is notably absent across all categories (all Z-scores below -0.1), aligning with generally healthier lifestyle choices. Engagement in physical activity is high, with frequent exercise both alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 0.53), as well as participation in sports (Z-score 0.91), all of which are established stress-reducing behaviors. Recreational habits show a preference for passive entertainment, with significantly higher engagement in video games (Z-score 1.71) and watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.28). While high video game usage shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS, suggesting it might function as a coping mechanism for this individual, a low frequency of reading (Z-score -0.67), which is negatively correlated with PSS, presents a minor counterpoint. Socializing with friends is within the average range.

Sleep patterns are notably regular and generally sufficient. The participant achieves a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score 0.72), which is higher than the population average and associated with lower stress. Crucially, the variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 58 minutes, Z-score -0.98) and sleep start time (standard deviation 45 minutes, Z-score -0.83) is significantly lower than average. This high consistency in sleep timing and duration indicates robust sleep hygiene, a strong protective factor against stress. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 technically indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the Z-score of -0.33 suggests that this participant's sleep quality is still slightly *better* than the average for the study population, highlighting the potential for widespread sleep issues within this specific student cohort.

Physiologically, heart rate data from wearable devices reveal well-maintained circadian rhythms. The participant exhibits higher than average interdaily stability (0.47, Z-score 0.5) and significantly higher 24-hour autocorrelation (0.45, Z-score 1.06), indicating a highly consistent and predictable daily heart rate pattern, often associated with lower stress and robust physiological regulation. Both the overall mean heart rate (Mesor 71.37 bpm, Z-score -0.35) and resting heart rate (57.6 bpm, Z-score -0.07) are slightly lower than the population average, suggestive of good cardiovascular fitness and a lower baseline physiological arousal. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is near average (10.47, Z-score -0.1), while the acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:05 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a distinct diurnal pattern, with significant reductions below resting heart rate during nocturnal hours (e.g., -19.39 bpm between 5-6 AM) indicative of restful sleep and robust physiological recovery. Daytime hours show appropriate increases in heart rate corresponding to periods of activity. While intradaily variability is slightly higher than average (0.58, Z-score 0.24) and positively correlated with PSS, suggesting slightly more fluctuations within the day, the overall profile of physiological regularity strongly supports a well-regulated system.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The participant's overall profile presents a strong convergence of evidence indicating a perceived stress level that would likely place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards lower perceived stress. Psychologically, the participant scores significantly below the population mean for both depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.72), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, meaning lower scores here suggest lower PSS. Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 0.96), and health satisfaction is elevated (Z-score 0.72), factors typically associated with greater resilience and lower stress. Behavioral indicators are also strong: the participant engages in high levels of physical exercise across multiple modalities (all exercise Z-scores > 0.5), has consistently high academic performance, and reports no substance use, all of which are protective factors against stress. Sleep patterns are highly regulated and sufficient; the median sleep duration is higher than average (Z-score 0.72), and critically, both sleep duration variability (Z-score -0.98) and sleep start time variability (Z-score -0.83) are significantly lower than average, reflecting excellent sleep hygiene. Physiological data reinforces this with higher interdaily stability (Z-score 0.5) and very high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06) in heart rate, indicating robust circadian rhythmicity which is negatively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, both mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.35) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.07) are slightly below average, typically associated with lower physiological stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, evidence suggesting elevated perceived stress is considerably less prominent. The most notable factor is a lower than average self-reported happiness score (Z-score -0.53), which is negatively correlated with PSS, thus implying a potential for higher stress. While the PSQI score of 6.0 is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" its Z-score of -0.33 indicates that the participant's sleep quality is still better than the average for this university student population. Lower engagement in reading (Z-score -0.67), which is negatively correlated with PSS, could also slightly contribute to higher perceived stress. Lastly, slightly higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.24), which is positively correlated with PSS, may indicate minor daily physiological fluctuations potentially linked to stress. However, these points are largely minor deviations or nuanced interpretations within a broader context of strong protective factors.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that this participant experiences relatively low perceived stress. The multiple indicators of low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, healthy lifestyle behaviors (exercise, no substance use), and exceptional sleep hygiene with highly regular circadian rhythms significantly outweigh the few, more modest indicators suggesting higher stress. The participant demonstrates strong psychological resilience and adaptive behavioral and physiological regulation. Therefore, based on a comprehensive assessment of the multimodal data, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls within the bottom 50% of the study population distribution.

93485,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a favorable psychological profile across several self-report measures. Depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 6.0 (Z-score -0.76), are notably below the population average, classifying the participant as ""not depressed."" Similarly, chronic anxiety levels are low, with a STAI-Trait score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.62), indicating a ""not anxious"" classification. Self-esteem is robust, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 44.0 (Z-score 0.82), placing it significantly above the mean. Furthermore, physical health satisfaction is exceptionally high at 6.67 (Z-score 1.8). Academic performance is also strong, with a Fall 2016 GPA of 3.62, suggesting effective navigation of academic demands. The only self-reported psychological measure falling below the population average is current happiness, with a score of 3.0 (Z-score -0.53), although this deviation is not as pronounced as the positive indicators. Collectively, these data suggest a psychological state characterized by low depressive and anxious symptomatology, high self-esteem, and general satisfaction with health.

The participant demonstrates generally good sleep patterns, both subjectively and objectively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8) indicates ""Good Sleep"" quality, consistent with the lower end of the clinically significant sleep disturbance threshold and below the population average for poorer sleep. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours 1 minute (Z-score -0.2), which is consistent with population averages. Importantly, the variability in sleep duration is notably low (70 minutes, Z-score -0.69), suggesting a consistent sleep schedule in terms of duration. While the median sleep start time is relatively late at 00:58:14, the standard deviation of sleep start time is average (81 minutes, Z-score -0.05). The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further suggests consolidated nighttime sleep rather than fragmented sleep patterns. Overall, the sleep data indicates a consistent and subjectively satisfactory sleep regimen, without pronounced objective disturbances.

Physiological regulation, as assessed by wearable metrics, appears robust and well-structured. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (0.53, Z-score 1.0) and strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, Z-score 1.23), indicating a highly regular and repeatable heart rate-based circadian rhythm from day to day. While intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.61, Z-score 0.46), suggesting some within-day fragmentation, this is offset by an exceptionally strong circadian amplitude (16.65, Z-score 1.9), which reflects a clear and pronounced difference between peak and trough physiological activity. The acrophase, or peak activity, is observed at 4:00 PM. Furthermore, the participant's resting heart rate of 47.3 BPM (Z-score -1.29) is significantly below the population average, indicative of a high level of cardiovascular fitness. These combined metrics portray a physiological system characterized by strong rhythmicity and excellent baseline cardiovascular health.

The hourly aggregated heart rate data further elaborates on the participant's robust circadian rhythm and physiological response to daily demands. Significant heart rate deviations below the mesor are observed during the early morning hours, particularly between 3-6 AM, with a lowest deviation of -32.26 (Z-score -2.02) from 5-6 AM. This substantial reduction in heart rate aligns with typical deep sleep periods, indicating effective physiological rest. Conversely, the participant demonstrates pronounced heart rate elevations during waking hours, with peaks occurring between 11 AM - 2 PM, reaching 19.0 (Z-score 2.05) and 20.84 (Z-score 2.22) above the mesor, respectively. These elevations reflect a vigorous physiological response to daytime activity and engagement. Heart rate gradually declines in the late evening, returning closer to baseline before midnight. This distinct daily pattern of physiological arousal and rest underscores a well-regulated autonomic nervous system with clear periods of activity and recovery.

The participant's lifestyle behaviors show some distinctive patterns. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine or liquor, is reported at '1-2 times a week' for both, with corresponding Z-scores around 1.0, indicating slightly higher consumption than the study population average. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as 'Not at all', which is below average. Exercise habits are generally robust, with the participant exercising alone 'Three times a week or more' (Z-score 1.07), a higher frequency than the average. However, participation in exercise with others and sports is lower than average. In terms of daily recreation, the participant notably avoids passive screen-based entertainment like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25) and video games (Z-score -0.56), as well as sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96). Instead, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends are within average ranges (1-2 hours), and reading is slightly higher (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32). This pattern suggests a preference for active, individual pursuits or moderate social engagement over passive leisure activities.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits numerous indicators consistent with lower or average perceived stress levels. Self-report measures show significantly lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.76) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62), along with markedly higher self-esteem (Z-score: 0.82) and exceptional satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: 1.8). Sleep quality is subjectively good (PSQI Z-score: -0.8) and objectively consistent, with low variability in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.69) and minimal napping (Z-score: -0.86), indicating consolidated nighttime rest. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a highly stable and robust circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 1.0; Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 1.23; Amplitude Z-score: 1.9), coupled with outstanding cardiovascular fitness as evidenced by a very low resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.29). The hourly heart rate data confirms a strong diurnal pattern with deep physiological rest periods and vigorous activity peaks. Lifestyle choices include a higher frequency of individual exercise, contributing to physical well-being.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting elevated perceived stress is relatively sparse and less pronounced. The participant reports slightly lower-than-average current happiness (Z-score: -0.53). Physiologically, there is a slightly higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 0.46), which could indicate some fragmentation in the daily rhythm, though this is overshadowed by other strong markers of circadian robustness. Lifestyle-wise, alcohol consumption for both beer and wine/liquor is slightly higher than the population average (Z-scores ~1.0). While these factors could potentially contribute to stress in some individuals, in this case, they are minor deviations compared to the overwhelming positive indicators.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's overall profile presents a compelling case for a relatively low or average level of perceived stress. The strong indicators of psychological well-being, including low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high health satisfaction, are powerful protective factors against stress. This is further reinforced by consistent good sleep quality and a highly robust physiological system, characterized by excellent cardiovascular fitness and a well-regulated circadian rhythm with pronounced daily variations in heart rate indicative of effective rest and arousal cycles. The few potential indicators of stress, such as slightly lower happiness or slightly higher alcohol consumption, are minor in magnitude and are largely outweighed by the breadth and strength of the adaptive psychological and physiological measures. Therefore, based on the comprehensive multimodal data, the participant's perceived stress level is most likely to be in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

62617,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a robust psychological profile, characterized by notably low self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD score 1.0, Z-score -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI score 28.0, Z-score -1.31), both of which are significantly below the population mean and classified as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Concurrently, self-esteem is considerably high (score 47.0, Z-score 1.24), and reported happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64) is substantially above average. These indicators align with generally lower perceived stress. Satisfaction with physical health (score 4.78, Z-score 0.38) is slightly above average, while trust in others is also high (score 4.0, Z-score 1.47), further suggesting a positive self-perception and social outlook. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, though a slight declining trend from 3.72 to 3.54 over three semesters is observable, suggesting sustained academic engagement despite potential pressures.

Objectively, the participant demonstrates a strong sleep profile with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 25 minutes, which is notably longer than the typical student (Z-score 1.53). Both sleep duration and sleep start time variability are slightly below the population average (standard deviations of 78 and 70 minutes, respectively, with negative Z-scores), indicating relatively consistent sleep patterns. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8), reinforcing the positive sleep quantity and regularity observed via wearables. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further complements the long nocturnal sleep duration and suggests a generally well-rested state.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate (60.6 BPM, Z-score 0.29) and mean heart rate (Mesor 78.2 BPM, Z-score 0.58) are slightly above the population average. A notable finding is the significantly low interdaily stability of heart rate (0.2, Z-score -1.73), indicating considerable day-to-day variability or irregularity in the heart rate-based circadian rhythm. While intradaily variability is also low (0.34, Z-score -1.45), suggesting less fragmentation within days, the low amplitude (7.67, Z-score -1.01) points to a blunted physiological range between peak and trough heart rate. This is somewhat contrasted by a stronger-than-average 24-hour autocorrelation (0.44, Z-score 0.98), suggesting a persistent, albeit irregular and blunted, underlying daily rhythm. The acrophase, or time of peak heart rate, is relatively late at 5:03 PM. Analysis of the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals that during typical deep rest hours (3-6 AM), the heart rate is relatively higher than peers (positive Z-scores for negative deviations, e.g., 5-6 AM Z-score 0.91), suggesting potentially less profound physiological deceleration or enhanced nocturnal arousal during sleep. Daytime heart rates show typical fluctuations, with peaks around late morning and early to late evening.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in a high level of physical activity, exercising alone (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53), and participating in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91), all well above the population average. This high level of exercise is a significant positive health behavior. Substance use is generally low, with beer consumption below average. However, wine or liquor consumption is slightly above average (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94). Engagement in typical daily recreational activities is notably low across the board; the participant reports minimal to no time spent on video games, internet usage, listening to music, reading, or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is also reported to be lower than average (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62). This pattern suggests a highly focused and potentially less varied recreational life, which might impact the diversity of stress-coping mechanisms or indicate a preference for active pursuits over passive leisure.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits numerous robust indicators strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Self-reported measures show significantly low depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.31), both well below the population mean and clinically classified as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score 1.24) and reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) are substantially elevated, consistent with a positive psychological state. Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI Z-score -0.8), and objectively, the participant achieves a significantly long median sleep duration (8 hours 25 minutes, Z-score 1.53) with relatively consistent sleep onset and duration. High levels of exercise (exercising alone Z-score 1.07, sports Z-score 0.91) are protective factors against stress, and these behaviors are well above the population average. Furthermore, a stronger-than-average 24-hour heart rate autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98) suggests a generally robust underlying circadian rhythm, which typically supports stable physiological functioning. These combined factors present a compelling case for a lower perceived stress level.

**Evidence for High PSS (top 50%):**
Despite the strong positive indicators, several physiological and behavioral patterns suggest underlying challenges that could potentially contribute to, or reflect, stress. The most salient physiological finding is the very low interdaily stability of heart rate (Z-score -1.73), indicating significant day-to-day irregularity in physiological rhythms. This, coupled with a blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.01), suggests a less robust and perhaps less adaptable cardiovascular response, which can sometimes be indicative of physiological strain. The analysis of hourly heart rate deviations points to relatively elevated heart rates during expected deep rest periods (e.g., 5-6 AM heart rate deviation Z-score 0.91), which may signify insufficient physiological recovery or nocturnal sympathetic activation. Additionally, while the GPA remains high, a slight downward trend over time could indicate increasing academic pressure. The participant's significantly low engagement in diverse recreational activities, including social interaction (socializing Z-score -0.62) and passive leisure (internet usage Z-score -1.16, reading Z-score -0.67), may limit typical stress-coping outlets, potentially reflecting an intense, focused lifestyle that leaves less room for active disengagement and recovery.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant presents a unique and somewhat contrasting profile. The overwhelming evidence from self-reported psychological measures (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem/happiness), combined with objectively long and consistent sleep and high levels of physical activity, strongly suggests effective coping mechanisms and a generally resilient psychological state. These are powerful buffers against perceived stress and align with a lower PSS score. While the physiological data reveal notable irregularities in circadian rhythm (low interdaily stability, blunted amplitude) and indications of elevated heart rate during nocturnal rest, these objective markers, though relevant, do not appear to translate into subjectively experienced stress, depression, or anxiety for this individual. It is plausible that the extensive sleep, high exercise engagement, and strong positive self-perception allow the participant to manage or mitigate the perception of stress despite underlying physiological irregularities. The strength of the psychological and behavioral protective factors outweighs the physiological indicators of potential strain in the context of perceived stress. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant’s overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution (PSS score below the 50th percentile of 22.0).

42137,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile presents a nuanced picture when evaluating perceived stress, characterized by a blend of health-promoting behaviors, subjective well-being challenges, and notable physiological arousal patterns. Self-report data indicate an average level of depressive symptoms (CESD score 15.0, Z-score 0.18, classified as 'Not depressed') and trait anxiety (STAI score 42.0, Z-score 0.07, classified as 'anxious'), suggesting a baseline proneness to anxiety without a significant depressive burden. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Score 37.0, Z-Score -0.17), and current self-reported happiness is notably below the population mean (Current 3.0, Z-Score -0.53). A critical finding from the self-report data is the participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-Score 0.59), which classifies their sleep as 'Disturbed Sleep' and exceeds the common clinical threshold for significant sleep difficulties. This subjective experience of poor sleep quality, along with lower happiness, correlates negatively with PSS and suggests a heightened perception of stress. Conversely, health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.3).

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant exhibits generally low substance use, reporting 'Not at all' for beer, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, and '1-2 times a month' for wine or liquor, with corresponding Z-scores mostly below or near the population average. Exercise habits are somewhat mixed; the participant exercises alone 'Three times a week or more' (Z-Score 1.07), which is above average and generally beneficial for stress management, but engages in exercising with others and sports at a lower or average frequency. Daily recreational habits indicate above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score 0.64) and significantly above-average time in a sedentary hobby (Z-Score 1.41). Conversely, time spent socializing with friends (Z-Score -0.62) and listening to music (Z-Score -0.72) is below average, while reading time is also relatively low (Z-Score 0.32 for ""15 minutes or less""). Reduced social engagement and less time in potentially restorative activities like reading or listening to music, especially when coupled with higher sedentary time, could indicate limited stress-buffering strategies or withdrawal.

Wearable-derived sleep statistics present a contrasting picture to the subjective PSQI score. The participant's median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-Score 0.14) is slightly above the population average, and both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit relatively low variability (standard deviations of 90 minutes and 78 minutes, respectively, with negative Z-scores), suggesting consistent sleep patterns. This discrepancy between subjectively disturbed sleep and objectively adequate and regular sleep duration highlights a potential issue with perceived sleep quality, continuity, or restorative capacity rather than outright sleep deprivation or irregularity.

Physiological data derived from heart rate reveal several key patterns related to arousal and circadian rhythms. The participant demonstrates strong indicators of cardiovascular health, with a significantly low resting heart rate of 50.3 bpm (Z-Score -0.93) and a low heart rate mesor of 62.62 bpm (Z-Score -1.55). Circadian rhythm metrics show slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-Score 0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-Score 0.22), implying a degree of regularity in their heart rate rhythm. However, intradaily variability is above average (Z-Score 0.60), which can be associated with increased physiological strain or less stable regulation. Furthermore, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is below average (Z-Score -0.72), suggesting a potentially blunted or less robust physiological response across the 24-hour cycle, which has been linked to higher stress. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of significantly elevated physiological arousal. Notably, the participant exhibits mean heart rates substantially above the population average during the late morning (9-11 AM, Z-scores 2.07 and 2.14) and, most prominently, in the late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z-score 2.76, indicating a substantial deviation of 27.38 bpm from the mesor). These pronounced and sustained peaks in heart rate relative to peers suggest consistent periods of heightened physiological activation, which, despite a low resting heart rate, could contribute significantly to the overall burden of perceived stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Elevated Perceived Stress (Top 50%):**

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the participant likely experiences elevated levels of perceived stress, placing them in the top half of the study population distribution. The most compelling indicator is the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, which clearly categorizes sleep as 'Disturbed Sleep' and is significantly above the population mean (Z-Score 0.59). Poor subjective sleep quality is a strong correlate of perceived stress. Complementing this, the participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-Score -0.53), which negatively correlates with PSS, further suggesting a higher perceived stress load. While the STAI-Trait score is average (Z-score 0.07), its classification as 'anxious' and positive correlation with PSS indicates a baseline predisposition for experiencing stress.

Objectively, the most prominent evidence for elevated stress comes from the physiological data. The significant and sustained hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, particularly the highly elevated peaks in late morning (9-11 AM, Z-scores > 2.0) and a remarkably strong peak in late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z-score 2.76), indicate consistent periods of heightened physiological arousal that are considerably above the population average. Such chronic or recurrent physiological activation is a strong objective marker for an elevated stress response. Furthermore, an above-average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-Score 0.60, positively correlated with PSS) and a below-average heart rate amplitude (Z-Score -0.72, negatively correlated with PSS) suggest a less resilient or blunted circadian rhythm response, both of which are commonly associated with increased stress. Lifestyle factors like below-average socializing and reading time, which correlate negatively with PSS, could also contribute to higher stress by potentially limiting effective coping or social support.

**Evidence for Lower/Median Perceived Stress (Bottom 50%):**

Some indicators suggest a capacity for lower stress or general physiological health. The participant exhibits excellent baseline cardiovascular fitness, evidenced by a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-Score -0.93) and a low overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-Score -1.55). Objective wearable sleep metrics show adequate sleep duration (7 hours 18 minutes, Z-Score 0.14) and good consistency in both sleep duration and start times (negative Z-scores for standard deviations), which typically contribute to lower stress. The participant also reports low substance usage across several categories and engages in above-average exercise alone (Z-Score 1.07), both of which are generally considered protective factors against stress. Self-reported depressive symptoms are not clinical (CESD score 15.0, Z-score 0.18), indicating an absence of a significant mood disorder that would heavily drive up PSS. Additionally, circadian rhythm analysis indicates slightly above-average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, suggesting some regularity in physiological patterns, which is typically associated with better health and lower stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**

While the participant demonstrates robust cardiovascular fitness and objectively regular sleep patterns, the overall picture leans towards elevated perceived stress. The strong subjective experience of 'Disturbed Sleep' (PSQI) and below-average happiness are powerful indicators of psychological distress. These subjective challenges are robustly supported by objective physiological evidence: the pronounced and sustained daily peaks in heart rate arousal are indicative of a body frequently in a state of heightened activation, likely reflecting or contributing to perceived stress. The above-average intradaily variability and below-average circadian amplitude further suggest a physiological system under strain. Despite the positive indicators like low resting heart rate and adequate objective sleep duration, the pervasive subjective distress signals and significant objective physiological arousal markers suggest that the participant's perceived stress levels are likely higher than the average student in the study population.

48013,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"The participant's data presents a coherent picture of elevated psychological distress and physiological dysregulation, which are strongly associated with higher perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate a notable burden of internalizing symptoms. The participant scored 55.0 on the STAI-Trait scale, yielding a Z-score of 1.35, which is classified as ""anxious"" and significantly elevated relative to the study population, with a positive correlation of 0.31 with the PSS score. Similarly, the CES-D score of 19.0 (Z-score of 0.59) classifies depressive symptoms as ""Depressed,"" also correlating positively with PSS (0.28). Further reflecting this internal distress, self-esteem is notably lower than average (score of 28.0, Z-score of -1.43), and self-reported happiness is significantly reduced (Current score of 2.0, Z-score of -1.61); both measures negatively correlate with PSS, indicating their protective role against perceived stress is diminished for this individual. The participant also reports significantly lower trust in others (Z-score of -2.07). These psychological indicators collectively suggest a vulnerability to and experience of elevated perceived stress.

Sleep quality and circadian rhythmicity appear to be significant challenges for the participant. Subjectively, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score of 0.13) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" aligning with a common clinical threshold for significant sleep disturbance. Objective Fitbit data further elaborates on this, revealing that while median sleep duration (6 hours 56 minutes, Z-score of -0.31) is only slightly below average, the variability in sleep patterns is pronounced. Both sleep duration (standard deviation of 151 minutes, Z-score of 1.13) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 119 minutes, Z-score of 0.8) exhibit significantly higher variability compared to the population, suggesting inconsistent sleep-wake schedules. These objective sleep irregularities are positively correlated with PSS. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further underscore this pattern of disruption: Interdaily Stability (Value 0.23, Z-score of -1.48) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value 0.14, Z-score of -1.54) are substantially below the population mean, indicating less regular and predictable daily physiological rhythms. The heart rate amplitude (Value 7.44, Z-score of -1.08) is also significantly blunted, which can be indicative of a dampened physiological response or chronic fatigue, and negatively correlates with PSS, suggesting lower amplitude is associated with higher stress.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. The participant's mesor (77.46 BPM, Z-score of 0.48) is slightly above the population average, while resting heart rate (59.3 BPM, Z-score of 0.14) is near average. A particularly salient finding is a marked surge in heart rate in the early morning, with the deviation from mesor reaching 8.33 (Z-score of 3.5) between 6-7 AM and 6.85 (Z-score of 2.07) between 7-8 AM. This represents an exceptionally high and rapid physiological activation upon waking, which correlates positively with PSS. Conversely, significant dips in heart rate activity are observed during midday, specifically between 12-1 PM (deviation -4.67, Z-score of -2.42) and 1-2 PM (deviation -1.2, Z-score of -1.92), indicating cardiovascular activity notably below the population average for these hours. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the afternoon at 4:28 PM. This combination of an exaggerated morning arousal response, subsequent midday troughs, and blunted overall amplitude suggests a potential dysregulation in autonomic nervous system function.

Behavioral habits present a mixed array of potential coping mechanisms and lifestyle patterns. The participant demonstrates a commendable commitment to physical activity, engaging in exercise alone and with others three times a week or more (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23, respectively), and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score of 0.91). While exercise is generally a robust buffer against stress, its impact here may be insufficient to fully counteract other stressors. Elevated consumption of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score of 0.94) is observed, which can sometimes serve as a coping mechanism for stress, although its correlation with PSS is weak. Recreational habits include above-average internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score of 0.85) and music listening (2-3 hours, Z-score of 1.13), alongside notably low engagement in reading (Z-score of -0.67), a habit that typically correlates negatively with PSS. Academically, the participant's GPA has shown a positive trend, increasing from 2.53 in Fall 2015 to 3.6 in Fall 2016, suggesting improving academic performance.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a PSS score in the lower half of the distribution is limited. The participant's self-reported health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.3), although its correlation with PSS is minimal (-0.08). The consistent and above-average engagement in various forms of exercise is generally recognized as a protective factor against stress. Furthermore, the notable improvement in GPA over the academic year suggests effective coping with academic demands, which might reduce academic-related stress. While the Intradaily Variability (IV) in heart rate is slightly lower than average (Z-score -0.53) and IV has a positive correlation with PSS, implying lower IV might be associated with lower PSS, this single indicator is insufficient to counterbalance the more compelling evidence of elevated stress across other domains.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
A substantial and convergent body of evidence strongly indicates that the participant’s perceived stress level likely falls into the top 50th percentile of the study population. The self-reported psychological measures are particularly salient: significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.35) and clinically classified depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.59) are both directly and positively correlated with PSS. These are further compounded by significantly lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.43) and reduced happiness (Z-score -1.61), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, meaning their low values contribute to higher perceived stress.

Objectively, sleep patterns are highly irregular, marked by significantly high standard deviations in both sleep duration (Z-score 1.13) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.8), complemented by subjective disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0). These sleep disturbances are all positively correlated with PSS. Physiologically, robust evidence of circadian rhythm dysregulation includes significantly low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.48) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score -1.54), along with a blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.08), all negatively correlated with PSS, pointing to less robust physiological rhythms being associated with higher stress. The pronounced and rapid early morning heart rate surge (Z-score 3.5 for 6-7 AM) also suggests a state of heightened physiological arousal. These multiple, converging indicators of psychological distress, disturbed sleep, and physiological dysregulation provide strong support for an elevated PSS score.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Based on a holistic analysis, the overwhelming majority of the salient psychological and physiological indicators point towards significantly elevated perceived stress. The pronounced levels of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with low self-esteem and happiness, form a robust psychological profile of distress. This is consistently reinforced by objective data demonstrating highly irregular and poor-quality sleep, alongside a dysregulated and less robust physiological circadian rhythm. While the participant engages in beneficial behaviors like regular exercise and shows improving academic performance, these positive factors are insufficient to mitigate the pervasive evidence of distress observed across multiple domains. The strength and consistency of the negative psychological and physiological markers, many of which are strongly correlated with PSS, place the participant firmly in the upper half of the perceived stress distribution relative to the study population (mean PSS 21.61, 50th percentile 22.0).

14571,12.0,0.015544041450777202,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a psychological profile characterized by notable resilience and positive well-being. Self-reported survey data indicate very low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 0.0, Z-score -1.38) and trait anxiety (STAI score 20.0, Z-score -2.11), both classifications being ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. These scores are significantly below the population mean and are associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (score 46.0, Z-score 1.1) and high current happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), both of which correlate negatively with perceived stress, reinforcing a robust psychological foundation. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45) but not significantly, while trust in others is notably low (Z-score -2.39), though its correlation with perceived stress is negligible.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a largely sedentary lifestyle with very limited engagement in physical exercise. All categories of exercise—alone, with others, and sports—are reported as ""Not at all"" or ""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" resulting in significantly negative Z-scores (e.g., exercised alone Z-score -1.93). This lack of physical activity, while not strongly correlated with PSS in the study population, can generally be considered a potential vulnerability for stress management. Conversely, recreational habits are dominated by extensive screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos (Z-score 3.17), video games (Z-score 4.74), and internet usage (Z-score 2.19), all exceeding four hours daily. Socializing with friends also occurs for more than four hours (Z-score 2.53). While these activities generally show weak positive or negative correlations with PSS, reading, engaged in for 16-30 minutes daily (Z-score 1.3), shows the strongest negative correlation (-0.2) among recreational habits, suggesting it may serve as a personal stress buffer. Substance usage is generally low, indicating it is not a primary coping mechanism.

Physiologically, wearable data reveal a highly stable and regular heart rate-based circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability (0.7, Z-score 2.4) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.59, Z-score 2.24) are both very high, indicating strong rhythmicity and predictability in daily physiological patterns. Concurrently, Intradaily Variability (0.22, Z-score -2.29) is very low, signifying less fragmentation in the heart rate rhythm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also robust (16.11, Z-score 1.72). These metrics collectively suggest an organized and stable physiological system, typically associated with lower stress. However, despite this strong rhythmicity, the participant exhibits a moderately elevated mean heart rate (Mesor 83.84, Z-score 1.35) and a slightly elevated resting heart rate (62.4, Z-score 0.51) compared to the population, both of which have positive correlations with PSS. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor also show generally higher than average activity during waking hours (predominantly positive Z-scores), with peak activity (acrophase) occurring in the late afternoon at 4:51 PM.

Sleep patterns are consistently positive, both subjectively and objectively. The participant reports ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.72). Fitbit data corroborates this with an average median sleep duration of 7 hours 14 minutes (Z-score 0.06). Crucially, the variability in sleep duration (35 minutes, Z-score -1.48) and sleep start time (54 minutes, Z-score -0.64) is remarkably low, indicating highly consistent and regular sleep habits. These stable and healthy sleep patterns are significant protective factors against perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the **bottom half** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a low PSS score stems from the participant's robust psychological well-being. Their extremely low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with high self-esteem and self-reported happiness, are all strongly correlated with lower perceived stress. These psychological strengths provide a significant buffer against stressors. Furthermore, the participant exhibits excellent sleep quality and remarkable consistency in sleep patterns, as evidenced by a low PSQI score, average sleep duration, and very low variability in both sleep duration and start time. Healthy and regular sleep is a well-established protective factor against stress. Physiologically, the highly stable and regular heart rate-based circadian rhythm (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability, high 24-hour Autocorrelation, high Amplitude) indicates an organized physiological system, which is generally associated with lower stress levels. Finally, the participant engages in reading, which showed the strongest negative correlation with PSS among their recreational activities.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50th percentile):**
Some factors do point towards potentially elevated stress. The participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor) and resting heart rate (RHR) are slightly elevated, and these metrics show positive correlations with PSS. This suggests a higher baseline physiological arousal which could be indicative of increased stress. The participant also reports a largely sedentary lifestyle with very limited exercise, which can be a missed opportunity for stress reduction, although direct correlations with PSS were weak. Additionally, extremely low trust in others, while not strongly correlated with PSS, could signify underlying interpersonal challenges that might contribute to a general sense of unease or stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the elevated heart rate metrics and lack of exercise provide some indication of physiological arousal or an absence of a common stress buffer, these are substantially outweighed by the strong psychological protective factors and the highly regular and healthy sleep and circadian patterns. The participant's low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, and happiness are powerful indicators of effective stress coping and overall well-being. The excellent sleep quality and circadian rhythmicity further solidify the impression of a well-regulated individual. Given the comprehensive and consistent picture of psychological resilience and physiological regularity, it is most likely that the participant experiences relatively low levels of perceived stress.

69057,26.0,0.927461139896373,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety, significant sleep deprivation, and academic challenges, coexisting with strong engagement in physical activity. Psychologically, the individual reports a notably high level of trait anxiety (STAI score 53.0, Z-score 1.16), placing them significantly above the population mean and indicating a chronic predisposition to experiencing anxiety. This is further supported by self-reported lower levels of happiness (Z-score -0.53) and below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), suggesting an internal psychological vulnerability. Despite these indicators, the participant’s depressive symptom burden as measured by the CES-D (score 12.0, Z-score -0.14) is below the population average, indicating that their distress may manifest more acutely as anxiety rather than depressive symptomatology. Academically, a concerning trend of declining GPA across academic semesters (from 3.1 to 2.28) is observed, which frequently correlates with increased academic pressure or difficulty coping, a significant potential source of perceived stress in a university population.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates severe chronic sleep deprivation, with a median sleep duration of only 5 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score -1.99), placing them significantly below their peers. This is corroborated by a PSQI score of 7.0, classifying their sleep as disturbed, despite a relatively consistent, albeit very late, median sleep start time of 02:08:15. This pattern of short, disturbed sleep, coupled with above-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.49), suggests a struggle to achieve adequate restorative rest. Physiologically, this sleep disruption is reflected in less robust circadian rhythmicity as derived from heart rate data: lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.74), higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.39), and lower autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.53). The reduced amplitude (Z-score -0.68) further suggests a blunted daily fluctuation in heart rate, indicative of a less structured and possibly fatigued physiological state. Despite these disruptions, the participant maintains an exceptionally low resting heart rate (43.6 bpm, Z-score -1.73) and mesor (57.89 bpm, Z-score -2.19), which typically indicate high cardiovascular fitness. The aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest deviations from the mesor occurring in the early morning hours (e.g., -22.51 at 5-6 AM) and a pronounced peak in physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 22.77 at 5-6 PM, Z-score 1.79).

In terms of coping behaviors, the participant is highly engaged in physical exercise, reporting exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53). This frequent exercise represents a significant positive coping mechanism that may buffer some effects of stress. However, there is also an above-average reported use of recreational drugs (Z-score 1.61), which could serve as a maladaptive coping strategy or contribute to the observed sleep and circadian irregularities. Other recreational habits include average time spent watching TV/videos and above-average time listening to music (Z-score 0.67), while engagement in reading and video games is minimal. The overall picture reveals a participant experiencing substantial psychological distress and chronic sleep deficit, likely exacerbated by academic pressures, yet also actively employing physical exercise as a means of coping. The underlying good cardiovascular fitness, while generally beneficial, does not appear to negate the impact of these significant behavioral and psychological stressors on their perceived well-being.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The evidence strongly suggests that this participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the top 50% of the study population.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50th Percentile):**
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI):** The participant's STAI score of 53.0 (Z-score 1.16) is significantly above the population average, indicating a high propensity for anxiety. Given the moderate positive correlation of STAI with PSS (0.31), this is a primary indicator of elevated perceived stress.
*   **Severe Sleep Deprivation:** A median sleep duration of 5 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score -1.99) is exceptionally low, representing chronic sleep deprivation, a known significant stressor. The PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) further confirms disturbed sleep quality.
*   **Declining Academic Performance:** The consistent decline in GPA across academic semesters points to significant academic challenges or distress, a common and potent source of stress for university students.
*   **Disrupted Circadian Rhythm:** Wearable data indicates lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability, and lower 24-hour autocorrelation in heart rate, reflecting a less regular and robust physiological rhythm often associated with stress and poor sleep.
*   **Lower Self-Esteem and Happiness:** The below-average scores for self-esteem (Z-score -0.45) and current happiness (Z-score -0.53) suggest underlying psychological vulnerabilities that can exacerbate the experience of stress.
*   **Recreational Drug Use:** The above-average use of recreational drugs (Z-score 1.61) could be a coping mechanism for stress, or contribute to further lifestyle irregularities and potential stressors.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
*   **Low Depressive Symptoms (CESD):** The CES-D score of 12.0 (Z-score -0.14) is below the population average, indicating a lower burden of depressive symptoms, which might differentiate this participant's stress profile from those experiencing co-occurring depression.
*   **High Engagement in Exercise:** The participant exercises alone frequently (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 0.53), which is a well-established and effective coping mechanism for stress reduction. This is a strong protective factor.
*   **Excellent Cardiovascular Fitness:** The exceptionally low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.73) and mesor (Z-score -2.19) indicate superior cardiovascular health, which could provide a physiological buffer against some of the negative health impacts of stress, though it does not necessarily reduce perceived psychological stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits strong positive coping mechanisms through frequent exercise and possesses excellent cardiovascular fitness, the cumulative evidence of high trait anxiety, severe chronic sleep deprivation, and declining academic performance presents a compelling picture of significantly elevated perceived stress. The disrupted circadian rhythm further underscores the physiological toll of their lifestyle. The absence of significant depressive symptoms does not negate the profound impact of anxiety and sleep loss on their daily functioning and subjective experience of stress. Therefore, despite some buffering factors, the pervasive and impactful stressors indicate that the participant is highly likely to report a PSS score in the top half of the study population distribution.

64232,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 44.0, Z-score 0.27, classified as ""anxious""), which is positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and self-esteem (Z-score -0.17) are below the population average, and both show negative correlations with perceived stress, suggesting that these factors may contribute to a higher overall stress perception. Depressive symptoms (CESD score 13.0, Z-score -0.03) are within the average range for the study population, indicating no significant depressive symptom burden. Health satisfaction is also aligned with the population average.

Analysis of sleep patterns reveals a discrepancy between subjective experience and objective duration. The participant reports significantly disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), which is considerably above the population average. Despite this, Fitbit data indicates a long median sleep duration of 8 hours (Z-score 1.01). However, objective sleep metrics also show substantial variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 136 minutes, Z-score 0.79) and, most notably, highly inconsistent sleep start times (standard deviation of 150 minutes, Z-score 1.48). This suggests that while the participant spends adequate time asleep, the lack of regularity in their sleep schedule likely contributes to the subjective experience of poor sleep quality and could be a significant factor in perceived stress.

Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further support a pattern of physiological irregularity. The participant exhibits significantly low interdaily stability (Value 0.22, Z-score -1.56), indicating a lack of day-to-day consistency in their physiological activity patterns, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.53) is also below average, reinforcing the notion of a less structured 24-hour rhythm. Intradaily variability is below average (Z-score -0.46), suggesting less fragmentation of activity within a day. The heart rate mesor is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.46), and the acrophase (peak activity) occurs relatively late in the day at 4:57 PM. The resting heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score 0.15).

Examination of aggregate hourly heart rate deviations reveals an atypical daily profile of physiological arousal. The participant demonstrates elevated heart rates relative to their mesor during periods that typically show decline or nadir, specifically in the late evening (9-10 PM, Z-score 0.90; 11-12 AM, Z-score 0.58) and extending into early morning hours (4-5 AM, Z-score 1.40). This pattern suggests prolonged physiological arousal extending into the typical rest period, which is not conducive to restoration and may indicate chronic stress. Concurrently, the participant engages in substance use, with above-average consumption of beer and wine/liquor, and notably high recreational drug use (Z-score 3.52). While these behaviors have weak direct correlations with perceived stress in this dataset, they can serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms or contribute to physiological burden. On the positive side, the participant engages in frequent sports (Z-score 1.58), which is a known protective factor against stress. However, there is low engagement in several other common recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, and reading, potentially limiting other outlets for relaxation and stress reduction.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50% of the study population) is robust across multiple domains. The participant's self-reported slightly elevated trait anxiety, below-average happiness, and lower self-esteem are all factors positively associated with heightened perceived stress. A key indicator is the self-reported ""disturbed sleep"" as measured by the PSQI, pointing to subjective sleep difficulties. This is further corroborated by objective Fitbit data revealing highly irregular sleep start times (Z-score 1.48) and significant day-to-day variability in physiological activity (Interdaily Stability Z-score -1.56). These sleep and circadian disruptions are strongly linked to increased stress. The observed pattern of prolonged physiological arousal during late evening and early morning hours, as indicated by hourly heart rate deviations, further suggests a state of chronic activation that can accompany elevated stress. Moreover, the participant's significantly elevated recreational drug use could be indicative of maladaptive coping strategies in the face of distress.

Conversely, some evidence suggests potential factors that might mitigate perceived stress or align with a lower PSS score (bottom 50%). The participant's depressive symptoms are within the normal range, and they engage in frequent sports activity (Z-score 1.58), which is a known positive coping mechanism associated with lower PSS. Objectively, the median sleep duration is long (8 hours), and intradaily variability is below average, which might indicate a less fragmented physiological rhythm within a single day. Health satisfaction is also average.

However, a holistic analysis weighs the evidence more heavily towards an elevated perceived stress level. The combination of chronic trait anxiety, reduced well-being, pervasive subjective sleep disturbance, and profound physiological and behavioral irregularities in sleep and circadian rhythms forms a coherent pattern consistent with high perceived stress. The significant physiological markers of irregular daily rhythms and prolonged arousal, coupled with potential maladaptive coping mechanisms like high recreational drug use, suggest that despite some protective factors like regular sports activity, the overall burden of perceived stress is likely substantial. Therefore, it is probable that the participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

37404,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret the participant's psychological state and perceived stress levels.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates generally low self-reported levels of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 7.0 (Z-score -0.66), and trait anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.62). Both these scores are below the population average, and their positive correlation with PSS suggests that these specific aspects might contribute to lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is found to be average (Z-score -0.03). However, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53), which typically correlates with higher perceived stress. While the participant maintains consistently high academic performance (GPA near 3.8), engagement in most recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing, and reading, is notably below the population average. Specifically, the participant reports not engaging in reading (Z-score -0.67), which shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), suggesting that this lack of engagement may be associated with higher perceived stress. Similarly, less participation in sports (Z-score -1.09) is also negatively correlated with PSS (-0.13). The participant engages frequently in solitary exercise (Z-score 1.07), though this specific behavior shows a negligible positive correlation with PSS, suggesting it may not fully mitigate stress for this individual. Substance use is moderate, with wine or liquor consumption being above average (Z-score 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent.

Regarding sleep and physiological patterns, objective Fitbit data indicates average median sleep duration (7 hours 9 minutes, Z-score -0.04) and notable consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score -0.78) and sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score -0.39). These consistent sleep patterns are typically associated with lower perceived stress, given their positive correlation with PSS, meaning less variability predicts lower PSS. The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86), which is associated with lower PSS. Despite this objective consistency, the participant's self-reported PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates subjective ""Disturbed Sleep,"" creating a notable discrepancy between objective sleep consistency and subjective sleep quality perception, often a marker of perceived stress. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated at 60.8 bpm (Z-score 0.32), which is positively correlated with PSS.

Further analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals significant indicators of physiological dysregulation. Interdaily stability (Z-score -1.56), 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.54), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm (Z-score -1.54) are all substantially below the population average, indicating reduced day-to-day regularity and a blunted physiological response to diurnal cycles. Conversely, intradaily variability is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.37), suggesting greater fragmentation and erratic fluctuations in heart rate within the day. These four metrics are all correlated with PSS in directions indicative of higher stress for this participant. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late at 5:32 PM, and the aggregated hourly heart rate data show elevated activity extending into the late evening (e.g., 6.88 bpm above mesor between 10-11 PM), which may disrupt the physiological wind-down process before sleep, contributing to the subjective experience of disturbed sleep despite objective consistency in sleep timing. Overall, the wearable data points to a physiological system under significant chronic dysregulation and fragmentation, commonly associated with elevated perceived stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits below-average levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting these factors contribute to lower perceived stress. Objective sleep data from the wearable indicates good consistency in both sleep duration and sleep start time, with Z-scores of -0.78 and -0.39 respectively. Given the positive correlations of these consistency metrics with PSS (0.14 and 0.17), the participant's *more consistent* sleep patterns would typically be associated with *lower* perceived stress. Furthermore, the absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) also correlates positively with PSS (0.14), suggesting this behavior is associated with lower stress. Consistently high academic performance (GPA) might also suggest effective stress management in the academic domain.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**
Despite low self-reported anxiety and depression, several robust indicators suggest an elevated level of perceived stress. The participant's self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53), correlating negatively with PSS (-0.19), which implies higher perceived stress. Subjectively, the PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" contradicting objective sleep consistency and serving as a strong marker of distress. Physiologically, the wearable data presents compelling evidence: Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.56), Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score -1.54), and Amplitude (Z-score -1.54) are all significantly below average and negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a highly irregular and blunted physiological rhythm, strongly associated with higher stress. Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.37) is significantly above average and positively correlated with PSS (0.16), pointing to substantial physiological fragmentation within the day, another strong indicator of elevated stress. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.32), and its positive correlation with PSS (0.14) further supports higher stress. Behaviorally, the participant shows significantly reduced engagement in various leisure activities, particularly reading (Z-score -0.67, with a negative correlation of -0.21) and sports (Z-score -1.09, with a negative correlation of -0.13), where lower engagement is associated with higher PSS. This suggests a potential lack of effective stress-buffering behaviors.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant reports low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, the overwhelming and consistent evidence from objective physiological metrics, coupled with specific behavioral patterns and subjective reports, strongly suggests a higher level of perceived stress. The significant and widespread dysregulation in heart rate-derived circadian rhythmicity (low interdaily stability, low 24-hour autocorrelation, low amplitude, high intradaily variability), each strongly correlated with higher PSS, points to a physiological system under considerable strain. This physiological picture is reinforced by an elevated resting heart rate and the subjective experience of disturbed sleep. Furthermore, the limited engagement in leisure and social activities, especially those with negative correlations to PSS like reading and sports, indicates a potential deficiency in coping resources or a prioritization that may contribute to stress. Given the profound and consistent patterns of physiological dysregulation and specific behavioral markers associated with higher perceived stress, the participant's overall perceived stress level is most likely in the top half of the study population distribution.

70492,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex psychological and physiological profile, marked by some indicators of psychological distress alongside certain areas of relative well-being and significant behavioral irregularities. Psychologically, the participant reports elevated trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 49.0 (Z-score = 0.76), classifying them as anxious and moderately correlating with higher perceived stress (0.31). Similarly, their CESD score of 16.0 (Z-score = 0.28) indicates slightly elevated depressive symptoms, also showing a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28). Counter-intuitively, the participant's self-esteem (Z-score = -0.59) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.62) are both below the population average, yet in this dataset, these metrics show a negative correlation with perceived stress, suggesting lower values are associated with lower PSS. Despite indicators of anxiety and depression, the participant reports higher-than-average current happiness (Z-score = 0.55), which negatively correlates with perceived stress (-0.19).

Sleep patterns present a notable divergence between self-report and objective measures. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0 is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" based on an absolute threshold; however, its Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their self-reported sleep quality is actually better than the average for the study population. In contrast, objective Fitbit data reveals significant irregularities: the standard deviation of sleep duration (222 minutes, Z-score = 2.75) is extremely high, as is the standard deviation of sleep start time (138 minutes, Z-score = 1.21). Both of these metrics positively correlate with perceived stress (0.13 and 0.17, respectively), suggesting a highly inconsistent sleep schedule that could contribute to stress despite reported subjective quality. The median sleep start time is notably late, at 03:03:40 AM.

Physiological data derived from heart rate monitoring further characterizes the participant’s daily rhythms. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average overall heart rate (Mesor Z-score = -0.6) and a less pronounced daily heart rate variation (Amplitude Z-score = -0.44), with the amplitude showing a negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.16). The acrophase, indicating the peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:12 PM. While interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.17) and intradaily variability is average (Z-score = -0.04), the pattern of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor suggests a delayed chronotype. Heart rates remain below the mesor until late morning (11 AM-12 PM) and show higher Z-scores (less negative deviations) during early morning hours (2-6 AM), possibly indicating less profound heart rate deceleration during sleep than the population average. Conversely, during peak daytime hours (12-3 PM), hourly heart rate deviations are notably higher relative to the mesor (e.g., 12-1 PM value = 14.49, Z-score = 0.91), suggesting higher physiological activity or arousal during these times compared to the population mean.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle includes notable deviations. Substance use includes higher-than-average beer consumption (Z-score = 1.01) and, strikingly, extremely high use of non-prescribed drugs (Z-score = 6.84), which, despite a weak correlation with PSS (0.03), represents a significant behavioral outlier. Exercise levels are generally low across all categories, indicating a largely sedentary lifestyle. Recreational habits show higher engagement in internet usage (Z-score = 0.85) and socializing with friends (Z-score = 0.95), both of which positively correlate with perceived stress (0.1 and 0.06 respectively). The participant also engages in more sedentary hobbies than average (Z-score = 1.41) but reports not engaging in reading (Z-score = -0.67) or video games (Z-score = -0.56), with reading showing a relatively strong negative correlation with PSS (-0.21) in this dataset.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI score Z=0.76), a factor with a moderate positive correlation (0.31) to PSS, suggesting a predisposition to higher perceived stress. Similarly, elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score Z=0.28) are present, which also correlate positively with PSS (0.28). Objective sleep data from the wearable device reveals significantly high variability in both sleep duration (Z=2.75) and sleep start time (Z=1.21), both of which are positively correlated with PSS (0.13 and 0.17 respectively). These substantial disruptions to sleep regularity are often significant contributors to stress. Furthermore, the participant's extremely high non-prescribed drug use (Z=6.84), while having a weak direct correlation with PSS (0.03), indicates a substantial behavioral deviation that could be a maladaptive coping mechanism for underlying stress or contribute to overall psychological burden. Hourly heart rate data also indicates patterns of potentially elevated arousal, with less HR suppression during early morning sleep hours and higher relative HR during daytime peak activity hours, which could be consistent with a stressed physiological state. Higher internet usage (Z=0.85) and socializing (Z=0.95) also show positive correlations with PSS (0.1 and 0.06 respectively).

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant's self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, despite a categorical classification of ""Disturbed Sleep,"" shows a Z-score of -0.33, indicating better-than-average subjective sleep quality within the study population. The participant also reports higher-than-average current happiness (Z=0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.19). Paradoxically, lower self-esteem (Z=-0.59) and lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.62) are correlated negatively with PSS (-0.15 and -0.07 respectively) in this dataset. The participant's infrequent engagement in reading (Z=-0.67) also correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21). Additionally, a lower heart rate amplitude (Z=-0.44) correlates negatively with PSS (-0.16).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While some self-reported measures (subjective sleep quality, happiness) and specific correlations (self-esteem, health satisfaction, reading) might suggest a lower or average perceived stress level, the most robust indicators point towards elevated stress. The presence of elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are strongly and directly correlated with perceived stress, weighs heavily. Crucially, the objective evidence of extreme variability in sleep duration and start time represents a significant physiological and behavioral dysregulation often associated with higher stress. The pronounced and extremely high non-prescribed drug use, irrespective of its direct correlation, suggests a substantial area of concern and potential distress. The contradiction between relatively good *subjective* sleep quality and severe *objective* sleep irregularity suggests a potential lack of insight or coping mechanism where the individual might not perceive the full impact of their irregular sleep on their well-being. Considering the combination of significant psychological distress, profound sleep dysregulation, and extreme behavioral anomalies, the overall evidence strongly suggests a heightened experience of perceived stress.

95543,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The analysis below integrates self-reported psychological measures, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data to evaluate the participant's psychological state and perceived stress levels within a university student population.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile characterized by exceptionally low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Self-reported scores on the CES-D (1.0, Z-score -1.28) and STAI-Trait (23.0, Z-score -1.81) place them significantly below the population mean, indicating minimal symptom burden. Complementing this, self-esteem (49.0, Z-score 1.52), current happiness (5.0, Z-score 1.64), and satisfaction with physical health (6.0, Z-score 1.3) are all considerably elevated compared to peers. Academic performance is consistently high, with GPAs ranging from 3.81 to 3.92 across semesters. These indicators collectively suggest a participant with strong psychological resources, positive affect, and high functional capacity.

Sleep patterns, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, are indicative of excellent sleep health. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.72) classifies the participant as a ""Good Sleeper."" Objective Fitbit data reinforces this, showing a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes (Z-score 0.29). Crucially, both sleep duration variability (60 minutes, Z-score -0.92) and sleep start time variability (34 minutes, Z-score -1.08) are significantly lower than the population mean, pointing to highly consistent and regular sleep routines. The absence of daily napping (Z-score -0.86) further supports a stable nocturnal sleep pattern.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm in heart rate, despite an elevated baseline. Measures of Interdaily Stability (0.54, Z-score 1.08) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.51, Z-score 1.57) are significantly above the population average, reflecting exceptional rhythmicity and predictability in daily heart rate patterns. The heart rate amplitude (13.2, Z-score 0.78) is also above average, suggesting a clear distinction between daytime activity and nighttime rest. However, both the overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 82.9, Z-score 1.22) and resting heart rate (66.7, Z-score 1.02) are notably elevated, indicating a generally higher level of cardiovascular activity compared to the study population.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern but with a particularly pronounced peak in the evening. Heart rate significantly decreases during sleep, reaching its lowest point between 6-7 AM (-20.5 beats per minute below mesor, Z-score -0.45). Heart rate then gradually increases throughout the day, showing substantial elevations in the late afternoon and evening. Specifically, the period from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM shows heart rate deviations of 18.86 to 21.48 bpm above the mesor, with the 8:00 PM-9:00 PM hour demonstrating a highly significant elevation (Z-score 2.09). This indicates a consistent and notable period of physiological arousal or high activity during typical evening hours, which aligns with the observed acrophase of 6:35 PM.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports no usage of alcohol (beer, wine/liquor) or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low Z-scores for all substance use categories. Exercise habits are notable for frequent engagement in social exercise (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.23), while individual exercise is reported as ""Not at all"" (Z-score -1.93). Recreational activities include significant time spent watching TV/Videos/Movies (""1-2 hours,"" Z-score 1.28) and, particularly, playing video games (""31 minutes an hour,"" Z-score 1.71), both of which are higher than average. Internet usage and socializing with friends are at average levels, while listening to music is notably low.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents a compelling profile consistent with a low or median perceived stress score. Self-reported measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.81) are significantly below the population mean and correlate positively with PSS, strongly suggesting lower stress. Furthermore, exceptionally high scores in self-esteem (Z-score 1.52), happiness (Z-score 1.64), and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.3) all correlate negatively with PSS, providing robust evidence for lower perceived stress. Excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.72) and highly consistent objective sleep duration and timing (low Z-scores for standard deviations of both) are further strong indicators, as good sleep is inversely related to perceived stress. Physiologically, the highly stable and regular circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.08, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 1.57) and a good amplitude (Z-score 0.78) are features often associated with lower stress, as rhythm disturbances are linked to stress. Behavioral factors such as the complete absence of substance use and high engagement in social exercise contribute to a healthier lifestyle that typically correlates with lower stress levels. High academic achievement also suggests effective coping with academic demands.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The primary evidence that could potentially point towards a higher PSS score comes from the physiological domain. The participant exhibits an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.02) and a higher overall heart rate mean (Mesor Z-score 1.22) compared to the population. Elevated resting heart rate specifically shows a positive correlation with PSS (0.14). Additionally, the notable peak in heart rate deviation during the 8:00 PM-9:00 PM hour (Z-score 2.09) suggests a period of significant physiological arousal. While this could be related to physical activity or stimulating recreational habits (like video gaming, which is high), sustained high physiological arousal can be a component of perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When weighing the evidence, the vast majority of indicators strongly align with a low or median perceived stress level. The participant's psychological well-being is exceptionally positive, characterized by very low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction. Their sleep quality and consistency are excellent, and their circadian rhythms are remarkably stable, which are all protective factors against perceived stress. While an elevated resting heart rate and overall physiological baseline, coupled with a prominent evening heart rate peak, suggest higher physical arousal, these aspects appear within a highly regular and otherwise healthy physiological system. Given the strong and numerous indicators of positive psychological and behavioral health, which are strongly correlated with lower PSS, the physiological arousal may represent active engagement rather than distress-induced chronic stress, especially considering the lack of corresponding psychological symptoms. Therefore, the participant’s perceived stress level is most likely in the lower half of the study population distribution.

67106,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant's data provides a comprehensive view of their psychological well-being, lifestyle, and physiological patterns, offering insights into their perceived stress levels relative to the study population.

**I. Psychological Well-being and Mental Health Indicators**
The participant exhibits a notably positive psychological profile. Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait) are significantly low (CESD score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.18; STAI score: 29.0, Z-score: -1.22), indicating substantially fewer depressive symptoms and lower trait anxiety than the average student in the population. Both metrics correlate positively with PSS, suggesting that these lower scores are associated with reduced perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (score: 46.0, Z-score: 1.1) and a very high level of happiness (score: 5.0, Z-score: 1.64), both of which are strongly associated with lower perceived stress in the population (correlations of -0.15 and -0.19, respectively). Furthermore, the participant expresses high satisfaction with their physical health (score: 6.22, Z-score: 1.47) and reports above-average trust in others (score: 3.67, Z-score: 0.83). Collectively, these self-reported psychological measures strongly suggest a resilient individual with a favorable mental health status and a disposition towards lower perceived stress.

**II. Lifestyle and Academic Performance**
Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high achievement, maintaining a GPA between 3.85 and 4.0 across multiple semesters. In terms of substance use, the participant reports no consumption of beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low Z-scores, indicating a lifestyle of abstinence. Physical activity levels are notably low, with reports of exercising alone less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score: -1.18) and no engagement in exercising with others or sports (Z-scores: -1.58 and -1.09, respectively). Regarding daily recreational habits, the participant reports minimal engagement in many typical leisure activities, including watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends, all falling significantly below the population average (e.g., Internet Usage Z-score: -1.83; Socializing Z-score: -2.2). Conversely, time spent reading is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.32), and reading is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.21). The low engagement in activities such as internet usage and socializing, which show positive correlations with PSS, might paradoxically act as a protective factor against certain sources of perceived stress for this individual.

**III. Sleep Patterns and Quality**
The participant's subjective sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), indicates some disturbance (score: 6.0, Z-score: -0.33). While this score is above the common clinical threshold for disturbed sleep, the Z-score suggests this level of disturbance is only slightly below average for the study population. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score: -0.51), which is slightly shorter than the population average. However, the variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation: 98 minutes, Z-score: -0.07) and sleep start time (standard deviation: 88 minutes, Z-score: 0.12) is within the average range. The participant also reports a slightly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score: 0.61) compared to peers. Overall, while there is an indication of subjective sleep disturbance and slightly shorter sleep duration, these patterns do not suggest extreme deviations from the peer group, and population-level correlations between sleep metrics and PSS are relatively weak.

**IV. Physiological Regulation and Circadian Rhythmicity**
The participant demonstrates exceptionally robust and stable circadian rhythms in heart rate. Interdaily Stability (value: 0.64, Z-score: 1.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (value: 0.57, Z-score: 2.07) are both significantly higher than average, indicating a highly regular and predictable daily physiological pattern. These metrics are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.11 and -0.16, respectively), suggesting that such regularity is associated with lower perceived stress. Intradaily Variability is below average (value: 0.47, Z-score: -0.53), also correlating positively with PSS (0.16), implying a more consistent physiological state throughout the day, which again points to lower stress. The heart rate Mesor (value: 72.42, Z-score: -0.21) is average, while Amplitude (value: 12.6, Z-score: 0.59) is slightly above average, indicative of a clear and pronounced physiological rhythm. The Acrophase, the peak of the heart rate cycle, occurs at 4:20 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly below average (value: 56.3, Z-score: -0.22). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals typical patterns: significant dips during early morning hours (e.g., -21.82 from 5-6 AM) reflecting deep rest, and elevations during daytime and early evening. Notably, there are prominent peaks in physiological arousal observed in the evening, particularly between 6-7 PM (18.4 deviation, Z-score: 1.02) and 8-9 PM (16.52 deviation, Z-score: 1.21), suggesting periods of heightened activity or engagement. These aggregative physiological patterns primarily support a conclusion of well-regulated biological rhythms associated with lower perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analysis of the multimodal data provides compelling evidence to assess the participant's overall perceived stress level.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most substantial evidence for a lower perceived stress level comes from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant's significantly low scores on the CESD (Z-score: -1.18) and STAI (Z-score: -1.22) indicate minimal depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which are positively correlated with PSS. Concurrently, very high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1), happiness (Z-score: 1.64), and health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.47) are strong indicators of psychological well-being, consistently correlating negatively with PSS. Physiologically, the participant exhibits exceptionally stable and regular circadian rhythms, evidenced by very high Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 1.9) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score: 2.07), and below-average Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -0.53). These strong, regular physiological patterns are consistently negatively correlated with PSS, pointing to a well-regulated biological system less susceptible to chronic stress. The participant's abstinence from substance use and above-average engagement in reading (which is negatively correlated with PSS) also contribute to a profile associated with lower stress. Furthermore, minimal engagement in internet usage and socializing, activities which show positive correlations with PSS, might act as a protective factor for this individual against common stressors in the student population.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a higher PSS score is less pronounced. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" and their median sleep duration is slightly shorter than average (Z-score: -0.51). While these suggest some sleep issues, the Z-scores are not extreme (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), indicating they are not significantly worse than their peers, and population-level correlations between these sleep metrics and PSS are weak. Additionally, the participant's low frequency of exercise is generally considered a potential risk factor for higher stress, but the correlations between exercise frequency and PSS in this specific population are weak and, in some cases, slightly positive, dampening this as a strong indicator for *higher* PSS in this context.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's profile strongly suggests a perceived stress level in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The robust indicators of psychological well-being (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem/happiness) and the exceptional physiological stability of circadian rhythms far outweigh the minor and less consistently correlated indicators of potential stress from sleep and exercise patterns. The consistent and significant deviations in their psychological scores towards lower distress, coupled with highly stable physiological regulation, paint a clear picture of an individual experiencing relatively low perceived stress.

83612,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a complex profile, characterized by notable psychological predispositions and distinct physiological patterns. Psychologically, a key feature is the significantly elevated score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), with a score of 58 and a Z-score of 1.65, classifying the individual as anxious. This suggests a chronic propensity to experience anxiety, a factor that is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). Concurrently, the participant reports lower self-esteem, indicated by a score of 29 (Z-score -1.29), which also exhibits a negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.15), implying that lower self-esteem may contribute to higher stress levels. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, are within the non-depressed range (score 15, Z-score 0.18), indicating average levels of depressive affect. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), while trust in others is below average (Z-score -1.1). Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with a GPA ranging from 3.7 to 3.82, suggesting academic competence and potentially effective management of academic demands.

Sleep patterns reveal a discrepancy between subjective experience and objective measurement. The participant self-reports good sleep quality via the PSQI (score 5, Z-score -0.8), but Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.59). While the standard deviation of sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score -0.76), suggesting relative consistency in sleep timing, the absolute duration is comparatively short. The standard deviation of sleep start time is average (Z-score 0.02), implying moderate variability in when sleep commences. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further characterizes this pattern of shorter, consistent nightly sleep without compensatory daytime rest.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveals a pattern of reduced circadian rhythm regularity and notable periods of elevated arousal. The participant's heart rate MESOR (70.01) and Resting Heart Rate (54.6) are slightly below the population average (Z-scores -0.54 and -0.42 respectively), generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. However, the circadian rhythm metrics show significantly lower Interdaily Stability (0.28, Z-score -1.07) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.17, Z-score -1.29), coupled with higher Intradaily Variability (0.7, Z-score 1.09). This configuration suggests a less regular and more fragmented daily heart rate rhythm, with greater moment-to-moment fluctuations in physiological activity, which is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.16). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score -0.48), indicating a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR shows typical nocturnal declines. During daytime, however, distinct peaks of elevated physiological arousal are observed, most notably between 12-1 PM (deviation of 14.94, Z-score 0.98), 4-5 PM (deviation of 15.79, Z-score 1.04), and critically, a pronounced peak in the late evening from 9-10 PM (deviation of 15.67, Z-score 1.33). These elevated late-evening heart rates suggest significant physiological activation continuing into periods typically associated with winding down.

Lifestyle behaviors indicate moderate engagement in physical activity, with exercise alone and with others occurring 1-2 times a week, corresponding to above-average frequencies (Z-scores 0.32 and 0.53 respectively). Substance usage is generally low or average. Recreational habits show an average time spent watching TV/videos, but notably less time socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and reading (Z-score -0.67), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.06 and -0.21 respectively). The participant engages more in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 0.82) than their peers. Health satisfaction is average (Z-score -0.03).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's PSS score likely falls into the top or bottom half of the study population (relative to the population median of 22.0), we consider the balance of evidence for both elevated and reduced perceived stress.

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is substantial. The most compelling factor is the participant's significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 58, Z-score 1.65), which is strongly and positively correlated with PSS (0.31). Individuals with high trait anxiety are predisposed to experiencing and reporting higher levels of perceived stress. This is further supported by below-average self-esteem (Z-score -1.29), a psychological characteristic generally associated with increased vulnerability to stress. Physiologically, the reduced circadian rhythm regularity, evidenced by low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.07) and high Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.09), especially the latter's positive correlation with PSS (0.16), suggests a less stable internal state that could contribute to heightened perceived stress. The distinct and notably high physiological arousal peaks in the late afternoon and particularly in the late evening (e.g., 9-10 PM hourly heart rate deviation with a Z-score of 1.33) also indicate a sustained state of activation, which often accompanies or exacerbates perceived stress. While objectively short, sleep duration (6 hours 42 minutes, Z-score -0.59) could also contribute to accumulated stress, despite subjective reports of good sleep. Engagement in potentially stress-buffering activities like socializing with friends and reading is below average, with reading showing a negative correlation with PSS (-0.21).

Conversely, some factors suggest a lower or average PSS score. The participant reports average levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.18) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8). Objective measures show a healthy resting heart rate (Z-score -0.42), and the participant engages in regular, above-average exercise, a known stress reducer. Academic performance is consistently high, which might indicate effective coping in this domain. Substance use is generally low, suggesting an absence of maladaptive behavioral coping. Furthermore, the negative correlations of Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation with PSS (-0.12 and -0.17 respectively) suggest that for this population, less stable rhythms are not necessarily associated with *higher* perceived stress, although the Intradaily Variability correlation points in the opposite direction.

Holistically, the strong presence of high trait anxiety, coupled with lower self-esteem and objective physiological indicators of internal dysregulation and sustained arousal, particularly in the late evening, provides substantial evidence for an elevated experience of perceived stress. While the participant maintains high academic performance and engages in regular exercise, these protective factors are likely offset by the underlying psychological vulnerability to stress and the observed physiological patterns. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, the participant's PSS score is more likely to be in the upper half of the distribution.

92566,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The following analysis interprets the provided psychological and behavioral data to evaluate the participant's perceived stress levels.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a robust psychological profile characterized by notable well-being and adaptive coping strategies. Self-report measures reveal significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 5.0, Z-score -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI score 24.0, Z-score -1.71) compared to the study population mean, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Concurrently, self-esteem (score 48.0, Z-score 1.38), current happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), and satisfaction with physical health (score 5.89, Z-score 1.22) are all substantially higher than average. Academic performance is also strong, indicated by a GPA of 3.99. Lifestyle behaviors align with a proactive approach to well-being; the participant engages frequently in solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) and dedicates significant time to reading (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score 1.3). Socializing with friends for 2-3 hours daily (Z-score 0.95) also suggests healthy social engagement. Conversely, engagement in passive recreational activities like watching TV, video games, and general internet usage is considerably lower than the population average. Alcohol consumption is moderate, with wine or liquor use slightly above average (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94), while the participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. These patterns collectively suggest strong internal resources and positive behavioral engagement, which typically mitigate perceived stress.

Regarding sleep, the participant's data presents a nuanced picture. Objectively, wearable metrics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 17 minutes, which is significantly shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.11). Furthermore, both sleep duration variability (120 minutes standard deviation, Z-score 0.43) and sleep start time variability (113 minutes standard deviation, Z-score 0.66) are higher than average, with a late median sleep start time of 00:48:38. These objective markers of insufficient and irregular sleep could potentially contribute to elevated stress. However, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, while categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" carries a Z-score of -0.33, implying that subjectively, the participant perceives their sleep quality as slightly better than the average study participant. This discrepancy suggests a possible adaptation to shorter sleep duration or a lower subjective impact of sleep irregularity on their overall well-being.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits several indicators of robust health and effective stress regulation. Their resting heart rate (49.05 bpm, Z-score -1.08) is notably lower than the population mean, reflecting strong cardiovascular fitness and generally low baseline physiological arousal. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor) across the day is also slightly below average (71.36 bpm, Z-score -0.35). The heart rate-based circadian rhythm demonstrates relative stability; interdaily stability is close to the population average (Z-score -0.08), and intradaily variability is slightly lower (Z-score -0.18), indicating a less fragmented physiological pattern throughout the day. A strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.56) further supports a well-defined daily rhythm. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs around 4:17 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate data show pronounced diurnal variation, with heart rates dropping significantly below the Mesor during nighttime (e.g., 2-5 AM, where values approach or even fall below the resting heart rate), signifying deep rest. Heart rates gradually rise through the morning and reach their highest deviations above the Mesor during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., +20.31 bpm at 6-7 PM), consistent with normal daily activity and arousal patterns. This physiological profile, particularly the very low resting heart rate and organized circadian rhythm, suggests a system that effectively recovers and manages daily demands, despite objective sleep quantity deficits.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence indicates that this participant's perceived stress level is likely in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. Psychologically, they report significantly lower than average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.86; positive PSS correlation) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.71; positive PSS correlation), both of which are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Elevated self-esteem (Z-score 1.38; negative PSS correlation), happiness (Z-score 1.64; negative PSS correlation), and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22; negative PSS correlation) further align with lower stress levels. Behaviorally, consistent engagement in exercise (Z-score 1.07) and reading (Z-score 1.3; negative PSS correlation) are known stress-buffering activities. Physiologically, an exceptionally low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.08; positive PSS correlation, meaning lower RHR correlates with lower PSS) is a robust indicator of good cardiovascular health and reduced baseline physiological stress. Furthermore, the participant's heart rate circadian rhythm exhibits a slightly lower than average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.18; positive PSS correlation) and higher 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.56; negative PSS correlation), suggesting a stable and regulated physiological system generally associated with better stress coping. Even the subjective PSQI score (Z-score -0.33; positive PSS correlation) indicates perceived sleep quality that is better than the population average, implying a lower impact on their perceived stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Evidence supporting a high PSS score is notably limited and largely confined to objective sleep metrics. The participant's median sleep duration of 6 hours 17 minutes is significantly shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.11), and both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit higher than average day-to-day variability (Z-score 0.43 and 0.66 respectively). These objective sleep deficits, particularly the variability, have positive correlations with PSS, suggesting they could contribute to increased stress. However, these factors must be weighed against the participant's self-reported subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.33), which indicates they perceive their sleep as relatively better than peers. The moderate alcohol consumption (wine/liquor Z-score 0.94) is slightly above average, but its correlation with PSS is negligible, suggesting it is unlikely to be a significant driver of perceived stress in this individual.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When evaluating the full spectrum of psychological, behavioral, and physiological data, the overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a participant who experiences perceived stress levels at the lower end of the study population distribution. The strong indicators of mental well-being (low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness), combined with effective coping strategies (exercise, reading, social engagement) and robust physiological markers (very low resting heart rate, stable circadian rhythms), strongly suggest resilience against perceived stress. While objective sleep duration and regularity are suboptimal, the participant's subjective perception of sleep quality is relatively positive, and their overall physiological regulation appears to compensate, minimizing the impact on their *perceived* stress. The consistent and strong correlations of the favorable psychological and physiological metrics with lower PSS scores reinforce this interpretation. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

35987,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological patterns that coalesce to present a profile indicative of elevated perceived stress. The most salient psychological finding is an elevated trait anxiety score (STAI score of 51.0, Z-score 0.96), which classifies the individual as anxious, a disposition that correlates positively with perceived stress (r=0.31). This suggests a chronic underlying vulnerability to experiencing anxiety, likely impacting their stress perception. Concomitantly, self-esteem is notably low (RSES score 28.0, Z-score -1.43), which can diminish coping resources and amplify stress, though its direct correlation with PSS is mildly negative. While depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z-score -0.34) and current happiness is slightly above average, these do not fully mitigate the impact of trait anxiety and low self-esteem. Further contributing to potential psychological strain are below-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.95) and lower trust in others (Z-score -0.78).

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits several patterns that could contribute to or reflect elevated stress. A significant and concerning decline in academic performance is evident, with the GPA decreasing from 3.33 to 2.31 over three semesters, often a strong indicator of academic pressure or difficulty managing demands. Lifestyle choices show a profound lack of physical activity, with ""Not at all"" reported for all exercise categories (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93), removing a well-established buffer against stress. Substance usage includes above-average beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01). Daily recreational habits are skewed towards sedentary screen time, with above-average engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (Z-score 0.85), both showing weak positive correlations with PSS. In contrast, time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and reading are below average, suggesting reduced engagement in activities that often foster social support and mental respite.

Sleep patterns represent a critical area of disturbance for this participant. Self-reported sleep quality is categorized as disturbed (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), a score that positively correlates with perceived stress (r=0.59). Objective Fitbit data corroborates this with a short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score -0.81), falling below recommended guidelines, and an exceptionally late median sleep start time of 02:45:29. While both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit less variability than the population average (low standard deviations), this stability appears to be centered around a significantly suboptimal and late sleep schedule rather than a healthy one. The participant also reports no napping, which is below the population average.

Physiological data from wearable activity metrics provide further insight into the participant's state of arousal and circadian regulation. The heart rate data indicates a structured overall circadian rhythm, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.74), a robust amplitude (Z-score 1.16), and above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.48). However, the acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late at 7:04 PM. Critically, analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals sustained periods of elevated physiological arousal, particularly during the late evening and early morning hours. From 9 PM to 1 AM, heart rate deviations are notably high compared to both the individual's mesor and the study population (e.g., 9-10 PM Z-score 2.27, 12-1 AM Z-score 1.72), indicating a prolonged state of activation during a time typically associated with winding down and initiating sleep. This pattern is highly suggestive of difficulty achieving physiological relaxation, which directly impacts sleep quality and contributes to perceived stress. Conversely, heart rate exhibits appropriate decreases during core sleep hours. The above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.81), which positively correlates with PSS (r=0.16), further suggests some physiological irregularity or less consistent transitions throughout the day, despite the overall stability of the circadian rhythm.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High Perceived Stress (Top 50th Percentile):**

The collective evidence strongly indicates that this participant likely experiences a high level of perceived stress, placing them in the top 50% of the study population. The elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.96) is a significant predisposition for higher stress, reinforced by its positive correlation with PSS (r=0.31). This psychological vulnerability is compounded by profoundly disturbed sleep patterns, including self-reported poor sleep quality (PSQI Z-score 0.59) and objectively short duration with a very late start time. The most compelling physiological evidence is the sustained elevation of heart rate during the critical late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 9 PM - 1 AM, Z-scores up to 2.27), indicating chronic physiological arousal that impedes relaxation and sleep onset. This is further supported by a late acrophase and above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.81, r=0.16 with PSS). Behaviorally, the significant decline in academic performance (GPA from 3.33 to 2.31) and the complete absence of physical activity, a crucial stress-coping mechanism, suggest an individual struggling to manage academic and personal demands. Lower self-esteem and health satisfaction also point to reduced psychological resilience.

**Evidence for Low or Median Perceived Stress (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

Evidence suggesting a low or median PSS score is notably weaker and less pervasive. The participant's depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z-score -0.34), and current happiness is slightly above average. Objectively, their sleep duration and start time, while suboptimal, exhibit less day-to-day variability than the population average, suggesting some degree of routine, however unhealthy. Physiologically, the high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.74) and amplitude (Z-score 1.16) of their heart rate circadian rhythm, coupled with above-average 24-hour autocorrelation, indicate a relatively robust underlying biological clock structure, which can be a protective factor against disorganization. Their resting heart rate is also slightly below average.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant exhibits some robust circadian rhythm characteristics and lacks significant depressive symptoms, the overall pattern of data strongly points towards elevated perceived stress. The pronounced trait anxiety, profound and consistent sleep disturbances (both subjective and objective), declining academic performance, lack of engagement in healthy coping behaviors like exercise, and especially the clear physiological signature of chronic late-night arousal (elevated heart rates during wind-down and sleep initiation periods) collectively suggest an individual under significant and sustained strain. The strength and number of indicators for elevated stress, combined with the positive correlations of key metrics (STAI, PSQI, Intradaily Variability) with PSS, far outweigh the limited evidence for lower stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

79341,15.0,0.038860103626943004,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and physiological profile. Psychologically, there is a notable disparity between self-reported happiness and other mental health indicators. While the participant reports significantly lower current happiness compared to the study population (Z-score -1.61), which typically correlates with higher perceived stress, scores for depressive symptoms (CESD score 10.0, Z-score -0.34) are below average, indicating a lack of significant depressive burden. Trait anxiety (STAI score 41.0, Z-score -0.03) is within the average range, neither notably elevated nor suppressed. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11), which can act as a minor protective factor against stress. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.28), yet the participant maintains a healthy Body Mass Index. This suggests that while there may be an underlying state of dissatisfaction or low positive affect, it does not manifest as significant depressive symptomatology or heightened trait anxiety, and overall psychological functioning is largely stable.

Regarding sleep patterns, objective wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 46 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.51). Sleep onset occurs late, with a median start time of 01:50:44. However, the participant demonstrates better-than-average consistency in sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score -0.32) and reports no napping. Crucially, the participant subjectively rates their sleep quality as ""Good"" on the PSQI (score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), indicating that despite objectively shorter and later sleep, they perceive their sleep as restorative and adequate. This suggests an adaptation to a specific sleep schedule rather than sleep being a significant stressor.

The participant exhibits robust and highly regular cardiovascular circadian rhythms. Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.91) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 0.98) are notably higher than the population average, reflecting consistent and predictable daily heart rate patterns, which typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a significantly low Mesor (mean heart rate of 64.24 bpm, Z-score -1.32) and an exceptionally low resting heart rate (48.25 bpm, Z-score -1.18). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a pronounced physiological trough during deep sleep (e.g., -24.83 bpm at 4-5 AM, Z-score -1.11), indicating substantial nocturnal recovery. Conversely, daily activity leads to a sharp and early peak in heart rate around midday (e.g., +20.05 bpm at 12-1 PM, Z-score 1.87), which is significantly higher than the population average for that hour. This considerable amplitude between nocturnal lows and diurnal highs, combined with overall low baseline heart rates, suggests a highly conditioned and responsive cardiovascular system that effectively engages in activity and recovers during rest, adhering to a stable and well-regulated daily rhythm. The Acrophase, peaking in the late afternoon, further indicates sustained activity levels throughout the day.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a healthy lifestyle concerning substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for all categories, which is significantly below population averages. Engagement in physical activity is high, with frequent exercise alone (Z-score 1.07), exercising with others (Z-score 0.53), and participation in sports (Z-score 0.91). This high level of physical activity likely contributes to their exceptional cardiovascular fitness and serves as a significant coping mechanism, as sports participation is negatively correlated with perceived stress. Recreational habits indicate a strong preference for digital media, with significantly above-average engagement in video games (Z-score 1.71) and above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies. Average time is spent socializing and listening to music, while reading and sedentary hobbies are largely absent. Notably, higher video game engagement for this population is negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting it functions as an effective stress-reducing activity for this individual.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To assess whether the participant’s overall perceived stress level would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, a holistic analysis of the available evidence, guided by the provided correlations with PSS, is necessary. The population median PSS score is 22.0.

Evidence supporting a **lower or average PSS score (bottom 50th percentile)** is robust and multifaceted:
*   **Psychological Well-being:** The participant exhibits below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.34) and above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), both of which are associated with lower PSS. Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good"" (PSQI Z-score -0.8), a strong indicator of reduced stress.
*   **Lifestyle and Behavioral Habits:** The participant engages in frequent physical exercise, including sports (Z-score 0.91), which has a negative correlation with PSS. Similarly, high engagement in video games (Z-score 1.71) also correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting these are effective coping strategies. The complete absence of substance use further points to a healthy, low-risk profile.
*   **Physiological Indicators:** The most compelling evidence comes from cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics. The participant exhibits exceptional cardiovascular fitness, with significantly low Mesor (Z-score -1.32) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -1.18). Crucially, a lower Mesor and RHR both correlate positively with PSS, meaning *lower* values predict *lower* PSS. Highly regular circadian rhythms, evidenced by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.91) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98), both correlate negatively with PSS, indicating lower stress with higher regularity. The pronounced hourly heart rate deviations, including a very high midday peak (Z-score 1.87) and a very deep nocturnal trough (Z-score -1.11), also correlate negatively and positively with PSS respectively, implying that these robust physiological responses are associated with lower perceived stress for this individual.

Evidence suggesting a **higher PSS score (top 50th percentile)** is primarily driven by:
*   **Affective State:** The participant reports significantly lower current happiness (Z-score -1.61), which has a moderate negative correlation with PSS, meaning lower happiness is associated with higher PSS. This is the most substantial individual piece of evidence pointing to elevated stress.
*   **Recreational Habits:** The participant reports ""Do not do"" for reading (Z-score -0.67), and reading has a negative correlation with PSS. Therefore, less reading implies a higher PSS.
*   **Circadian Rhythm:** Slightly elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.32) has a positive correlation with PSS, suggesting a minor contribution to higher stress. A slightly below-average heart rate Amplitude (Z-score -0.19) with a negative correlation implies higher PSS.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
While the participant's significantly low self-reported happiness and minimal engagement in reading suggest a propensity for higher perceived stress, these are outweighed by a comprehensive suite of protective factors. The robust physiological health, characterized by exceptional cardiovascular fitness and highly stable circadian rhythms, coupled with frequent engagement in physical exercise and positive digital recreation (video games), collectively demonstrate a strong capacity for stress resilience and effective coping. The subjective experience of ""Good Sleep"" further mitigates a common stressor. The majority of metrics with strong correlations to PSS, particularly the objective physiological and behavioral measures, point towards lower perceived stress. Therefore, despite the indicator of low happiness, the overwhelming balance of evidence suggests the participant possesses strong buffering mechanisms against perceived stress.

The participant exhibits a robust psychological profile characterized by low levels of reported distress and high well-being. Self-report measures indicate significantly lower depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.51) compared to the study population, both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports higher self-esteem (Z-score: 0.4), substantially elevated happiness (Z-score: 1.64), and greater satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score: 1.3), factors generally associated with resilience against stress. While the participant's GPA shows a slight decline across semesters, the absolute values remain high, suggesting academic competence despite potential minor fluctuations in performance or perceived academic pressure.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active and socially engaged lifestyle. Exercise frequency, both alone (Z-score: 0.32) and with others (Z-score: 0.53), is above the population average, indicating consistent physical activity which is commonly associated with stress reduction. Similarly, time spent socializing with friends is notably high (Z-score: 0.95), suggesting a strong social support network. Substance use is generally low or non-existent across categories. The participant engages extensively in listening to music (Z-score: 2.06), a recreational habit that can serve as a coping mechanism or source of enjoyment.

Physiological data from wearables reveal a nuanced picture. The participant's resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.21) is slightly below the population mean, aligning with lower physiological arousal and potentially lower perceived stress. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest heart rates occurring during early morning sleep hours (e.g., 5-7 AM, Z-scores: -0.67 to -0.84), suggesting periods of physiological rest. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, is observed at 5:12 PM, indicating a stable and well-timed daily rhythm. However, some aspects of circadian regulation show mild deviations from the norm; intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.74) is above average, indicating a more fragmented heart rate rhythm, which is positively correlated with perceived stress. Additionally, the 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.36) is slightly below average, suggesting a minor reduction in day-to-day regularity of the heart rate cycle, which is also negatively correlated with PSS.

Regarding sleep, the self-reported PSQI score of 6.0 is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""; however, the associated Z-score of -0.33 indicates that the participant experiences *better* subjective sleep quality than the average study participant. Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours 5 minutes, which is slightly below the average (Z-score: -0.13) but still within a healthy range. Importantly, the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score: -0.39) is lower than average, reflecting greater consistency in nightly sleep length, a factor generally linked to better sleep health. Conversely, the median sleep start time is relatively late (02:25:00), and the standard deviation of sleep start time (Z-score: 0.35) is higher than average, indicating greater variability in bedtime, which is positively correlated with perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

The most compelling evidence supporting a lower-than-average perceived stress level comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. The participant exhibits significantly low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.51), both of which are strongly negatively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, high self-esteem (Z-score: 0.4), markedly elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64), and high health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.3) collectively suggest a resilient psychological state. Behaviorally, consistent engagement in exercise and high levels of social interaction are established buffers against stress. Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is below average (Z-score: -0.21), indicative of lower baseline physiological arousal. Moreover, the self-reported subjective sleep quality, despite its classification, is better than the population average (PSQI Z-score: -0.33), and Fitbit data shows greater consistency in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.39). These robust indicators strongly point towards a participant who experiences relatively low levels of perceived stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

While the preponderance of evidence suggests lower stress, a few metrics indicate potential areas of elevated physiological or behavioral irregularity that are positively correlated with perceived stress. Wearable data shows a higher-than-average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 0.74), suggesting a more fragmented daily physiological rhythm. Additionally, the 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.36), implying less day-to-day regularity in circadian patterns. In terms of sleep, despite consistent sleep duration, the participant exhibits higher variability in sleep start times (Z-score: 0.35), which is positively correlated with perceived stress. These factors collectively indicate some level of irregularity in daily physiological and sleep timing that could contribute to, or be a manifestation of, higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

Synthesizing the multimodal data, the extensive evidence for robust psychological well-being, including very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, strongly outweighs the more subtle indicators of physiological and sleep schedule irregularity. The participant's engagement in positive coping behaviors like exercise and socializing further reinforces a profile of lower perceived stress. While there are some indications of a less regular daily heart rate rhythm and variable sleep onset times, these do not appear to manifest as significant psychological distress or high physiological arousal (as evidenced by low RHR and favorable PSQI Z-score). Therefore, the overall interpretation is that this participant likely experiences relatively low or average levels of perceived stress compared to their peers.

67608,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant's data presents a complex, multimodal profile balancing indicators of resilience and well-being with specific areas of physiological and subjective disturbance. The overall psychological profile suggests a robust capacity for managing stress, while certain behavioral and physiological patterns hint at underlying arousal.

Psychologically, the participant demonstrates a highly resilient profile. Self-report measures indicate very low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score of 1.0, Z-score -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI score of 26.0, Z-score -1.51), both significantly below the population mean. These findings are complemented by notably high self-esteem (score 45.0, Z-score 0.96) and a high current happiness rating (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64). The participant also maintains a high academic GPA (ranging from 3.8 to 4.0) and expresses above-average satisfaction with their physical health (score 4.56, Z-score 0.22), further reinforcing a positive overall self-perception and functional capacity.

Regarding lifestyle, the participant engages frequently in physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91), both significantly above population averages. This high level of physical activity is generally associated with better stress management. Alcohol consumption, including beer and wine or liquor, is reported at 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Z-scores ~1.0). Notably, the participant reports abstaining from recreational and non-prescribed drug use. A striking pattern is observed in daily recreation habits: the participant reports extremely low engagement in socializing with friends (15 minutes or less, Z-score -2.2) and avoids many common passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, or reading. This suggests a preference for solitary, active pursuits or a limited social network, which could be a personal coping style but, in some contexts, could also limit social support resources.

Wearable data reveals a combination of highly consistent sleep behaviors alongside indicators of potential internal arousal. Objectively, the participant exhibits highly consistent sleep patterns, with low standard deviations in both total sleep duration (58 minutes, Z-score -0.98) and sleep start time (26 minutes, Z-score -1.24), indicating a very regular sleep-wake schedule, albeit with a relatively late median sleep start time of 01:13:59. Median sleep duration is average (7 hours 12 minutes, Z-score 0.02). However, this objective consistency contrasts with a self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite a near-average Z-score of 0.13. This discrepancy highlights a subjective experience of poor sleep quality that isn't fully reflected in objective duration or regularity. The participant also reports a slightly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.61).

Cardiovascular metrics from wearable data further elaborate on daily physiological patterns. The participant exhibits a healthy, below-average resting heart rate (53.6 bpm, Z-score -0.54) and a below-average mesor (68.25 bpm, Z-score -0.78), indicating generally lower baseline physiological arousal. Their circadian rhythm displays above-average interdaily stability (0.48, Z-score 0.58), suggesting regularity in their overall daily physiological rhythms. However, a significant finding is the markedly high intradaily variability (0.77, Z-score 1.58), which points to irregular physiological arousal or activity patterns *within* the day. Furthermore, hourly heart rate deviations reveal pronounced elevations in the late evening, particularly between 8-9 PM (deviation of 22.81 from mesor, Z-score 2.32) and 10-11 PM (deviation of 15.91, Z-score 1.49). These substantial increases in heart rate late in the day could signify heightened physiological activity or arousal preceding the late bedtime, potentially contributing to the subjectively reported disturbed sleep.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The evidence strongly suggests that this participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would fall into the **bottom half** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for lower perceived stress comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. Scores on the CES-D (depressive symptoms) and STAI (trait anxiety) are remarkably low (Z-scores -1.28 and -1.51, respectively), both showing positive correlations with PSS, meaning lower scores indicate lower PSS. Conversely, self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) are significantly above average, and both are negatively correlated with PSS, further supporting a lower perceived stress level. The participant also maintains high academic performance and high frequency of exercise, which are generally associated with adaptive coping and well-being. Physiologically, a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.54) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.78) indicate good cardiovascular health and lower chronic physiological arousal. Objective sleep data further shows high consistency in sleep duration and start times (negative Z-scores for variability), which is a marker of stable routines often associated with better sleep quality and lower stress, despite the subjective report.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Some aspects of the data suggest potential stressors or physiological arousal. The participant subjectively reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI, although its Z-score is only slightly above average (0.13). Wearable data indicates significantly high intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 1.58), which is positively correlated with PSS, suggesting irregular physiological patterns within the day. Furthermore, pronounced elevations in heart rate are observed in the late evening (8-9 PM, Z-score 2.32; 10-11 PM, Z-score 1.49), indicating significant physiological arousal during a period when winding down is typically expected. The extremely low level of social engagement (Z-score -2.2 for socializing with friends) is also a notable behavioral pattern; while not directly correlated with PSS in this dataset, a lack of social connection can be a significant stressor for many individuals. Higher alcohol consumption could also be a coping mechanism for some.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While there are clear indicators of physiological arousal and subjective sleep disturbance, the sheer magnitude and consistency of the positive psychological indicators (very low anxiety and depression, very high happiness and self-esteem) are powerful predictors of lower perceived stress. These psychological traits often act as buffers against external and internal stressors, influencing how individuals appraise and cope with challenges. The objectively consistent sleep schedule, high physical activity, and good cardiovascular health further support a resilient profile. The physiological arousal observed in the evening and high intradaily variability, while significant, likely exist within a robust psychological framework that enables the participant to perceive and manage stress effectively. Therefore, despite these physiological markers, the overall psychological well-being and adaptive behavioral patterns strongly suggest a lower overall perceived stress.

19735,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"The participant's psychological and physiological data reveal a complex profile characterized by significant indicators of psychological distress alongside some adaptive behaviors. Analysis of self-reported measures suggests elevated levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, with a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 34.0 (Z-score 2.15), classified as ""Depressed,"" and a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 47.0 (Z-score 0.56), classified as ""anxious."" Both scores correlate positively with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores in the study population. Additionally, self-esteem is notably low (score 31.0, Z-score -1.01), and self-reported happiness is below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.45). These elements collectively suggest a considerable internal psychological burden, contributing to a perception of stress.

Behavioral habits further illuminate this pattern. The participant reports engaging in recreational drug use 1-2 times a month, which is significantly higher than the population average (Z-score 3.52). Alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor) is also above average (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively). Concurrently, engagement in social activities is markedly low, with ""Socializing with Friends"" reported as ""15 minutes or less"" per day (Z-score -2.20), suggesting significant social withdrawal. Participation in exercise, particularly with others, is also low (Exercised with Others: ""Not at all"", Z-score -1.58). While academic performance, as indicated by GPA, has shown improvement over time, these social and recreational behaviors, coupled with elevated substance use, may function as coping mechanisms for underlying distress or contribute to it.

Sleep patterns present a nuanced picture. Subjectively, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" aligning with a clinical threshold for sleep disturbance. However, relative to the study population, this score has a Z-score of -0.33, indicating it is slightly better than the average participant's PSQI score, despite still being clinically significant. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score 0.77), which is above the population average. However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:01:45 AM, and sleep duration exhibits some variability (standard deviation of 112 minutes, Z-score 0.25). This discrepancy between subjective disturbance and objective duration, combined with a late and somewhat irregular sleep schedule, may still contribute to perceived stress, particularly in an academic environment.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicate distinct circadian rhythm characteristics. The participant's resting heart rate is low (50.3 bpm, Z-score -0.93), which is often associated with higher cardiovascular fitness or lower physiological arousal. However, the circadian amplitude, representing the difference between peak and trough heart rate, is high (14.29, Z-score 1.13), suggesting a pronounced physiological response range throughout the day. The acrophase, or time of peak heart rate activity, is observed at 5:26 PM, which is relatively late. Interdaily Stability is near average, but Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.21, Z-score -0.95) is low, indicating less day-to-day rhythmicity in heart rate patterns. Hourly deviations from the mesor reveal that heart rate is significantly lower than the mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score -1.5), and rises to above-mesor levels throughout the afternoon and early evening, reflecting the acrophase. This pattern of a very low resting heart rate but a high amplitude in daily heart rate fluctuation, combined with less consistent day-to-day rhythmicity, may indicate a physiological system that, while possessing a low baseline, experiences significant daily shifts that could be exacerbated by stressors.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score stems from the participant's self-reported psychological state. The CES-D score is substantially high (Z-score 2.15), indicating significant depressive symptoms, which correlates positively (0.29) with PSS. Similarly, the STAI score for trait anxiety is above average (Z-score 0.56) and also correlates positively (0.31) with PSS. Low self-esteem (Z-score -1.01, correlation -0.16) and below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.19) further contribute to a profile indicative of internal distress. Behavioral patterns, particularly significantly elevated recreational drug use (Z-score 3.52) and marked social withdrawal (Socializing with Friends Z-score -2.20), are often associated with higher stress or maladaptive coping strategies. The high amplitude (Z-score 1.13) in the heart rate circadian rhythm could also suggest a physiological system prone to larger fluctuations, potentially in response to stressors.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Some factors might suggest a lower PSS score. The participant maintains a strong academic record, with an improving GPA. Objectively measured sleep duration is good (7h 48m, Z-score 0.77). Although the PSQI score indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" its Z-score (-0.33) relative to the study population suggests that this participant's subjective sleep quality is slightly better than the average student in the cohort, despite being clinically disturbed in absolute terms. A notably low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.93) is generally associated with lower physiological stress or higher fitness. The intradaily variability (Z-score -0.25) is slightly lower than average, suggesting slightly less variability in heart rate *within* a day, which might imply a relatively stable internal state.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Weighing the evidence, the indicators of significant psychological distress—namely high depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and pronounced social withdrawal—present a strong case for elevated perceived stress. These self-reported experiences are potent predictors of PSS. While the participant exhibits some positive characteristics such as a strong GPA, good objective sleep duration, and a low resting heart rate, these do not outweigh the substantial evidence of internal psychological burden and maladaptive coping behaviors. The discrepancies, such as good sleep duration despite subjective disturbance and a low resting heart rate alongside high circadian amplitude, suggest a complex physiological response that may still operate under considerable stress. The overall pattern strongly points towards an individual experiencing heightened levels of perceived stress within the study population.

59207,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by notable strengths in psychological well-being and engagement in health-promoting behaviors, alongside specific challenges concerning sleep regularity and certain recreational habits. Self-report measures indicate a resilient psychological state, with depressive symptoms (CESD score 10.0, Z-score -0.34) and trait anxiety (STAI score 37.0, Z-score -0.43) both below the study population mean, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Concurrently, self-esteem is notably high (score 43.0, Z-score 0.68), and satisfaction with physical health is significantly above average (score 6.0, Z-score 1.3). These psychological traits generally correlate negatively or negligibly with perceived stress, suggesting a robust internal capacity for coping. Academically, the participant maintains a consistent and strong GPA across semesters. Behavioral patterns further support an active lifestyle, with frequent exercise both alone (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) and with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53), and regular participation in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91), activities typically associated with reduced stress. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer, is slightly above average (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01), while recreational and non-prescribed drug usage is absent. Recreational screen time is notably high, with video game usage at 1-2 hours daily (Z-score 2.47) and internet usage at 2-3 hours (Z-score 0.85). Interestingly, while high internet usage correlates positively with stress (0.11), high video game usage correlates negatively with stress (-0.14) in this population.

Despite these positive psychological and behavioral indicators, the participant's sleep patterns present a complex and somewhat contradictory picture. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" suggesting subjective difficulties. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a high median sleep duration of 8 hours and 13 minutes (Z-score 1.28), which is generally beneficial. However, this is significantly offset by extreme variability in sleep. Both sleep duration (standard deviation 169 minutes, Z-score 1.55) and sleep start time (standard deviation 141 minutes, Z-score 1.27) show exceptionally high irregularity. These high levels of sleep inconsistency are positively correlated with perceived stress (0.14 and 0.17, respectively), suggesting they may be significant contributors to overall stress levels. The median sleep start time of 01:34:59 further underscores a late and potentially fluctuating sleep schedule.

Physiological data, derived from heart rate metrics, largely points to a well-structured and robust circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.24) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 0.81), along with a high Amplitude (Z-score 1.05) and low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -2.08). These metrics are generally associated with a stable and well-regulated physiological rhythm, which typically serves as a protective factor against stress. The participant's resting heart rate is average (61.4 bpm, Z-score 0.39), with a positive, albeit moderate, correlation with PSS (0.14). An analysis of mean aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with troughs in the early morning and peaks during the afternoon and evening. Notably, heart rate deviations are above average during specific periods, such as 2-3 PM (Z-score 1.3) and particularly late in the evening between 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.37), which could suggest periods of heightened physiological arousal or activity. However, the correlations for these specific hourly deviations with PSS are not consistently positive, complicating a direct inference of stress from these isolated elevations. For instance, the 10-11 PM deviation has a negative correlation (-0.15), suggesting higher deviation at this time is associated with *lower* perceived stress in this population, which might reflect active engagement in non-stressful activities.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To assess whether the participant's overall perceived stress level falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the PSS population mean (21.62) and median (22.0).

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant demonstrates strong psychological well-being, which is a primary indicator of lower perceived stress. Their CESD (Z-score -0.34) and STAI (Z-score -0.43) scores are below the population average for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and both scales have moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31). This suggests that the participant's lower symptom burden likely translates to lower perceived stress. Furthermore, a high self-esteem (Z-score 0.68) and significantly high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.3) are observed, both correlating negatively with PSS (-0.15 and -0.08), providing additional psychological buffers against stress. Lifestyle behaviors such as frequent exercise, including sports (Z-score 0.91, correlation -0.13), also support lower perceived stress. Physiologically, robust circadian rhythm parameters, including high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.24, correlation -0.12), low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -2.08, correlation 0.16), and high Amplitude (Z-score 1.05, correlation -0.17), point towards a stable and well-regulated system that is generally associated with lower stress. The high median sleep duration (Z-score 1.28, correlation -0.05) is also a factor favoring lower PSS.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for elevated perceived stress stems from significant sleep irregularities. Despite adequate sleep duration, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), indicating subjective poor sleep quality. Objectively, both sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score 1.55) and sleep start time standard deviation (Z-score 1.27) are exceptionally high, reflecting highly inconsistent sleep patterns. These objective measures of sleep variability exhibit positive correlations with PSS (0.14 and 0.17, respectively), strongly suggesting they contribute to higher perceived stress. Additionally, the participant's self-reported happiness is lower than average (Z-score -0.53), and its negative correlation with PSS (-0.19) implies that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. The slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.39, correlation 0.14) and above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.85, correlation 0.11) also provide mild support for higher PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant presents a mixed profile. On one hand, core psychological well-being indicators (low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, high health satisfaction) are strongly indicative of a lower PSS. These psychological traits have stronger correlations with PSS than the sleep variability metrics. Furthermore, several physiological circadian rhythm metrics and overall sleep duration also lean towards lower stress. On the other hand, the participant experiences significant and objectively extreme sleep irregularity, compounded by a self-report of disturbed sleep and lower happiness, which are all associated with higher perceived stress. However, given the participant's demonstrated psychological resilience—specifically low self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are often the most direct predictors of perceived stress—and the overall stability in their core circadian rhythm (despite sleep timing variability), it is more likely that their perceived stress level remains in the lower half of the distribution. The robust internal resources seem to mitigate the impact of the sleep irregularities on *perceived* stress, even if those irregularities represent a physiological challenge.

96613,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile suggests a generally robust mental well-being. They reported lower than average depressive symptoms (CESD score 7.0, Z-score -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI score 34.0, Z-score -0.72), alongside higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and notably high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.05). While their self-reported happiness was slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.53), these overall indicators suggest a foundational resilience against common psychological stressors. In terms of sleep, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep""; however, their Z-score of -0.33 indicates better subjective sleep quality relative to the study population average. This is further supported by wearable data revealing significantly longer median sleep durations (8 hours 29 minutes, Z-score 1.61) and highly consistent sleep start times (standard deviation of 34 minutes, Z-score -1.06). Sleep duration variability was also lower than average (Z-score -0.53). These consistent and extended sleep patterns contrast with the PSQI classification and suggest effective sleep consolidation from an objective standpoint, although their median sleep start time is relatively late (01:31:30) and they report more frequent napping (Z-score 0.94).

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a low resting heart rate (47.8 bpm, Z-score -1.23), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data reveals an average level of interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and autocorrelation (Z-score -0.03), suggesting consistent daily physiological patterns. However, intradaily variability was slightly elevated (Z-score 0.67), indicating larger fluctuations within the daily heart rate rhythm. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm was significantly higher than average (Z-score 1.26), with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring in the late afternoon (5:26 PM). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor (average heart rate) further details this pattern: while heart rates were significantly lower during early morning sleep, they exhibited marked and sustained elevations throughout the afternoon and evening. Notably, deviations peaked between 2-4 PM (Z-scores up to 2.21 and 2.02), remaining high into the late evening hours (up to 9 PM), suggesting prolonged periods of elevated physiological arousal or activity during the latter part of the day.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains high academic performance (GPA consistently around 3.6). Their exercise habits are characterized by significant engagement in social or organized physical activities (exercising with others Z-score 1.23, sports Z-score 0.91), contrasting with a very low frequency of exercising alone (Z-score -1.93). Substance use includes above-average beer consumption (Z-score 1.01), with minimal use of other substances. Recreational habits show a preference for screen-based activities, with above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64) and playing video games (Z-score 0.96). They also engage in significantly more sedentary hobbies than the average student (Z-score 1.41) and less time reading (Z-score -0.67) or listening to music (Z-score -0.72). Socializing with friends is at an average level, and self-reported trust in others is slightly above average (Z-score 0.5). The combination of high engagement in sedentary screen-based activities and a late sleep start time may be related to the sustained physiological arousal observed in the evening hours, potentially influencing their overall daily energy expenditure and recovery.

In summary, the participant presents a profile characterized by strong psychological buffers against stress, including low self-reported anxiety and depression, high self-esteem, and high health satisfaction. Objectively, their sleep duration is long and consistent, and their resting heart rate indicates good physical fitness. However, they exhibit sustained periods of elevated physiological arousal in the afternoon and evening, coupled with a preference for sedentary recreational activities and a late sleep onset. These patterns suggest a robust physiological system that, while fit, experiences significant daily fluctuations and prolonged engagement in activities that may contribute to sustained arousal, despite the general psychological well-being.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Multiple self-reported psychological measures strongly indicate a lower level of perceived stress for this participant. Their significantly low scores on the CES-D (Z-score -0.66) and STAI (Z-score -0.72) scales suggest reduced depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which are positively correlated with PSS scores. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and high satisfaction with health (Z-score 1.05) are also factors generally associated with lower perceived stress. Objective sleep metrics provide further support, with significantly longer median sleep durations (Z-score 1.61) and highly consistent sleep start times (Z-score -1.06), which are patterns typically linked to lower stress levels. Furthermore, despite a 'Disturbed Sleep' classification, their PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates better subjective sleep quality than the population average. The participant's notably low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.23) also suggests excellent cardiovascular fitness, which often serves as a physiological buffer against stress. High engagement in social exercise (Z-score 1.23) is a known stress-reducing behavior.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, certain physiological and behavioral patterns could be interpreted as indicators or consequences of elevated perceived stress. The participant reported slightly lower happiness (Z-score -0.53), which is negatively correlated with PSS. Wearable data revealed higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.67), which is positively correlated with PSS, suggesting less regular physiological rhythm within the day. More prominently, the mean aggregate heart rate deviation data shows significantly elevated physiological arousal throughout the afternoon and evening, with Z-scores peaking above +2.0. While these peaks could be related to physical activity, sustained high arousal without adequate recovery could contribute to or reflect stress. The participant also reports more frequent napping (Z-score 0.94), which, while potentially aiding total sleep, has a weak positive correlation with PSS, possibly indicating fragmented sleep or higher daytime sleepiness associated with stress. Higher beer consumption (Z-score 1.01) and high engagement in sedentary screen-based hobbies (e.g., video games Z-score 0.96, sedentary hobby Z-score 1.41) could be passive coping mechanisms or reflect patterns that do not effectively alleviate stress.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
Upon holistic evaluation, the evidence for a lower or average perceived stress level substantially outweighs the evidence for an elevated one. The participant's self-reported psychological state—characterized by notably low depression and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, and health satisfaction—provides a strong foundation for inferring lower perceived stress, particularly given the moderate positive correlations of CES-D and STAI with PSS. These core psychological indicators are robust. Furthermore, the objective and subjective improvements in sleep quality and quantity, coupled with excellent cardiovascular fitness, represent significant protective factors. While the participant exhibits sustained physiological arousal during the latter half of the day and engages in some behaviors (e.g., higher napping, sedentary hobbies) that could be linked to stress, these are secondary to the primary indicators of psychological well-being. The interpretation of elevated physiological arousal is also complex, as it could stem from intense engagement or activity rather than psychological distress alone. Therefore, it is most likely that this participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

50766,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This analysis synthesizes multimodal data from self-reported surveys, sleep statistics, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret the participant's psychological state, behaviors, and their potential relation to perceived stress.

**Psychological Well-being and Lifestyle Traits**
The participant generally exhibits strong psychological well-being markers, with self-reported scores indicating relatively low depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.24) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43) compared to the study population. These findings are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.68) and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 0.97), both of which are generally protective factors against stress. Academically, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA (ranging from 3.83 to 4.0), suggesting strong academic performance and potential academic resilience, though high achievement can also be a source of pressure. Conversely, the participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and slightly below-average trust in others (Z-score -0.46), hinting at potential underlying emotional or interpersonal nuances.

**Behavioral Habits and Social Engagement**
The participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, engaging in exercise with others ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.23) and sports ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.91). This robust engagement in physical activity, particularly social exercise, is commonly associated with effective stress management. However, a striking pattern emerges in their general recreational and social habits. The participant reports engaging in ""socializing with friends"" for ""15 minutes or less"" per day (Z-score -2.2), indicating remarkably low informal social interaction compared to peers. Similarly, engagement in internet usage, listening to music, reading, video games, and sedentary hobbies is also lower than average. This suggests a lifestyle that prioritizes structured activities like exercise and potentially academics over unstructured leisure and informal social time. Regarding substance use, the participant reports higher than average frequency for beer consumption (Z-score 1.01) and recreational drug use (Z-score 1.61), which, while weakly correlated with PSS, can sometimes serve as coping mechanisms for stress.

**Sleep Patterns and Quality**
Objectively, the participant's sleep patterns derived from wearable data appear relatively healthy. They average 7 hours and 29 minutes of sleep (Z-score 0.37), which is slightly above the population median, and exhibit below-average variability in sleep start time (Z-score -0.63), indicating consistent sleep-wake timing, albeit with a late median sleep start of 01:27:15. However, self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), suggesting a subjective perception of poorer sleep quality despite adequate duration and regularity. The participant also reports slightly above-average napping frequency (Z-score 0.61). This discrepancy between objective sleep metrics and subjective experience may indicate underlying factors impacting perceived restfulness, which weakly correlates with higher perceived stress.

**Physiological Regulation and Circadian Rhythmicity**
Physiologically, the participant exhibits an exceptionally robust and well-entrained circadian rhythm. Metrics such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.41), Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.57), and Amplitude (Z-score 1.63) are all significantly higher than the population average, while Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.16) is notably lower. These findings collectively indicate a highly regular and structured daily physiological rhythm, with a strong contrast between activity and rest phases. Such robust circadian rhythmicity is generally associated with greater physiological resilience and better health outcomes, including lower stress. The average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.01) further supports a baseline of normal cardiovascular health. However, an analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveals distinct periods of significantly elevated physiological arousal. Specifically, heart rates are substantially above the mesor during the afternoon (e.g., 3-4 PM, Z-score 2.58) and evening (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score 1.43; 7-8 PM, Z-score 1.35), aligning with the Acrophase (peak activity) at 5:23 PM. These high hourly deviations suggest intense periods of cardiovascular activity or heightened arousal that are considerably beyond population norms during these times, which could be related to strenuous physical activity, academic demands, or other significant daily stressors.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**
The available evidence presents a mixed picture, but several prominent indicators strongly suggest the participant's perceived stress level (PSS) is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a relatively low or average PSS score (bottom 50%):
*   **Strong Psychological Resilience:** Low scores on the CESD (depressive symptoms, Z-score -0.24) and STAI (trait anxiety, Z-score -0.43) are robust indicators of lower mental health burden, which are consistently associated with lower PSS (correlations 0.28 and 0.31, respectively, meaning lower scores on these scales predict lower PSS).
*   **Positive Self-Perception and Health:** Above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.68) and high health satisfaction (Z-score 0.97) are generally protective factors against stress, with weak negative correlations to PSS.
*   **Adaptive Physiological Regulation:** The most compelling physiological evidence points to highly adaptive functioning. The participant exhibits exceptionally stable and robust circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.41, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 1.57, Amplitude Z-score 1.63, Intradaily Variability Z-score -1.16). These strong physiological regularities are generally associated with better stress coping and resilience, with correlations to PSS being predominantly negative for stability measures and positive for variability, meaning these healthy rhythms predict lower PSS.
*   **Adequate Objective Sleep:** Objective sleep duration is slightly above average (7 hours 29 minutes, Z-score 0.37) and sleep start time is consistent (low variability Z-score -0.63). While subjective sleep quality is perceived as ""disturbed,"" the objective metrics of duration and consistency are favorable.
*   **High Physical Activity:** Frequent engagement in social exercise and sports (Z-scores 1.23 and 0.91) is a well-known buffer against stress.

Evidence for a relatively high PSS score (top 50%):
*   **Subjective Sleep Disturbance:** The PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates subjectively ""disturbed sleep,"" which has a weak positive correlation (0.13) with PSS.
*   **Low General Social Engagement:** The participant's extremely low reported time spent ""socializing with friends"" (Z-score -2.2) is a significant concern, as social support is a critical buffer against stress. Although the correlation with PSS is weak (0.06), the magnitude of this deviation is notable. However, high engagement in *social exercise* may partially mitigate this.
*   **Below Average Happiness:** A lower self-reported happiness score (Z-score -0.53) has a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.19), implying lower happiness is linked to higher stress.
*   **Periods of Elevated Physiological Arousal:** The significantly high hourly heart rate deviations, particularly at 3-4 PM (Z-score 2.58), indicate periods of intense physiological activity or arousal. While these could be related to strenuous exercise (consistent with their high activity levels), they could also reflect periods of acute stress or high demand.
*   **Higher Substance Use:** Above-average usage of beer and recreational drugs, though weakly correlated, can sometimes be indicative of coping mechanisms for stress.

Holistic Analysis:
The participant exhibits a strong foundation of psychological resilience, evidenced by low depression and anxiety scores, high self-esteem, and satisfaction with health. Crucially, their physiological data reveals an exceptionally robust and regular circadian rhythm, a powerful biomarker for overall well-being and stress resilience. While there are indicators that might suggest higher stress, such as subjective sleep disturbance, very low informal socializing, and periods of high physiological arousal, these appear to be largely outweighed by the fundamental psychological strengths and the consistent, adaptive physiological regulation. The periods of high heart rate activity, in particular, could be a functional response to intense engagement in academic work or physical exercise, rather than purely distress. The lack of informal socializing is a significant variable, but the participant's active engagement in structured social exercise and sports might fulfill some social needs.

Given the substantial evidence of strong psychological coping resources and robust physiological regulation, the participant is more likely to fall into the lower range of perceived stress within the study population.

71089,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of potential vulnerability. Notably, depressive symptoms, as assessed by the CESD, are moderately elevated (Score 16.0, Z-score 0.28) and classified as 'Depressed', while trait anxiety (STAI Score 46.0, Z-score 0.46) is also above average and classified as 'anxious'. Both of these measures show positive correlations with perceived stress. A prominent feature is the significantly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.57), suggesting a fundamental negative self-perception. This is further compounded by a below-average level of self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and significantly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.45), which collectively point towards a general state of diminished well-being. Despite this, the participant demonstrates consistent and high academic achievement with an improving GPA.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a largely sedentary lifestyle. There is a notable absence of engagement in physical exercise across all reported categories (e.g., 'Exercised Alone' Z-score -1.93, 'Exercised with Others' Z-score -1.58), which is a significant factor associated with increased stress and poorer mental health outcomes. Conversely, daily recreational habits show high engagement in passive activities such as internet usage (Z-score 1.52), listening to music (Z-score 1.6), watching TV/videos (Z-score 0.64), and video games (Z-score 0.96). While these activities may serve as leisure or coping mechanisms, their prevalence alongside minimal physical activity suggests a pattern that may not optimally support stress reduction. Social engagement with friends is moderately high (Z-score 0.95), which could be a beneficial social support factor. Substance use, specifically alcohol, is moderate and does not appear to be a significant deviation from the population average.

Sleep patterns present a notable dichotomy between objective regularity and subjective experience. Wearable data reveal excellent sleep hygiene in terms of quantity and consistency: the participant records a significantly high median sleep duration of 8 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score 1.26), with very low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.85) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.96). This indicates a highly structured and consistent sleep schedule. However, despite these objectively favorable metrics, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as experiencing ""Disturbed Sleep."" This suggests that even with ample and regular sleep, the individual perceives their sleep quality as problematic, which can itself contribute to or reflect underlying psychological stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics provide compelling evidence of chronic arousal. The participant exhibits a significantly elevated Resting Heart Rate (71.2 bpm, Z-score 1.55) and an unusually high 24-hour mean heart rate (Mesor of 86.93 bpm, Z-score 1.77). These are robust indicators of persistent sympathetic nervous system activation, frequently associated with chronic stress and cardiovascular strain. Despite this elevated baseline, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm displays strong structural integrity, characterized by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.33), low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.81), and a robust amplitude (Z-score 0.83). This signifies a consistent and well-defined daily physiological rhythm, although the rhythm itself is operating at a generally higher cardiovascular level. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor confirm a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rate lowest during early morning sleep and highest during waking activity. However, given the high overall mesor, these daily fluctuations occur on an elevated baseline, implying sustained physiological activation throughout the day.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence for a relatively low or average PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes the participant’s consistently high academic performance, which might act as a protective factor against academic-related stress. Furthermore, objective wearable data indicate excellent sleep quantity and remarkable regularity in both sleep duration and sleep start times, alongside a highly stable and well-structured heart rate-based circadian rhythm. These factors generally contribute to physical and psychological resilience. The participant also reports a moderately high level of socializing with friends, suggesting a potentially beneficial social support network.

Conversely, there is substantial evidence supporting a relatively high PSS score (top 50th percentile). The participant reports above-average levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which correlate positively with perceived stress. Critically, self-esteem is significantly low, and satisfaction with physical health is poor, indicating internal struggles that often exacerbate stress. A pronounced sedentary lifestyle, characterized by a complete lack of physical exercise, is a known risk factor for elevated stress and poorer mental well-being. Most compellingly, the physiological data reveal a state of chronic arousal, evidenced by a significantly elevated Resting Heart Rate and a very high 24-hour mean heart rate (Mesor). These objective physiological markers strongly align with sustained stress. Additionally, despite objective sleep regularity, the participant's self-reported sleep quality is categorized as disturbed, highlighting a subjective experience of poor sleep that can contribute to perceived stress.

Considering the cumulative evidence, the presence of significant psychological distress (elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self-esteem), a markedly sedentary lifestyle, and particularly the robust physiological indicators of chronic arousal (high resting heart rate and mesor) strongly suggest that the participant experiences a higher level of perceived stress. The positive factors, while important, are not sufficient to outweigh the pervasive psychological and physiological markers of distress. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

22688,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant’s data provides a multimodal perspective on their psychological state, perceived stress, and behaviors. A synthesis of self-report measures, wearable-derived physiological metrics, and behavioral patterns is presented to evaluate their perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

**Psychological Profile and Well-being**
The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile characterized by notably low levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety. Their CESD score of 5.0 (Z = -0.86) classifies them as 'Not depressed', and their STAI score of 27.0 (Z = -1.41) indicates they are 'not anxious'. Both measures exhibit a positive correlation with PSS, meaning lower scores align with a reduced stress burden. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (Score = 46.0, Z = 1.1) and a significantly elevated sense of happiness (Score = 5.0, Z = 1.64), both of which are inversely related to perceived stress. Further underscoring this positive disposition is a high satisfaction with physical health (Score = 5.89, Z = 1.22). Academically, the participant maintains an exceptional GPA consistently above 3.89 across multiple semesters, suggesting effective academic performance and potentially low academic stress. These self-reported metrics collectively present a strong picture of mental and emotional well-being, broadly indicating a lower propensity for elevated perceived stress.

**Sleep Patterns**
Wearable and self-reported data reveal a consistent and largely healthy sleep architecture. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z = -0.8) indicates 'Good Sleep', indicative of minimal subjective sleep disturbance. Objectively, the participant averages 8 hours and 2 minutes of sleep per night, which is significantly above the population mean (Z = 1.05) and negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting this longer duration is associated with lower stress. Furthermore, sleep patterns exhibit notable regularity, with both sleep duration (Standard Deviation = 78 minutes, Z = -0.51) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation = 47 minutes, Z = -0.79) showing less day-to-day variability than the average student. The absence of daily napping (Z = -0.86) further contributes to a consistent nocturnal sleep schedule. The observed high sleep quality and regularity, often inversely associated with stress, support a physiological foundation for effective stress management.

**Circadian Rhythm and Heart Rate Dynamics**
Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms reveals a nuanced pattern. While the resting heart rate of 60.4 bpm is slightly above the population average (Z = 0.27) and shows a mild positive correlation with PSS, other circadian parameters suggest a somewhat blunted or less dynamic physiological rhythm. Interdaily stability (Value = 0.27, Z = -1.15) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value = 0.11, Z = -1.79) are both below average, suggesting less day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns; however, intriguingly, these measures correlate negatively with PSS, implying less stability is linked to lower PSS in this study context. Intradaily variability is notably low (Value = 0.29, Z = -1.8), and its positive correlation with PSS suggests this low variability could be associated with higher perceived stress. The circadian amplitude (Value = 8.75, Z = -0.66) is also below average, indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:14 PM. Hourly heart rate data show a robust physiological activation in the morning, peaking sharply between 8-9 AM (deviation of 8.41 from mesor, Z = 1.32), followed by sustained elevated activity through the afternoon and early evening, consistent with the later acrophase. Despite some indications of less rhythmicity and a slightly elevated resting heart rate, the overall daily heart rate profile reflects a clear and active physiological engagement during waking hours.

**Behavioral Habits**
The participant's behavioral habits present a mixed profile. Alcohol consumption is notably above average, with both beer (Z = 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z = 0.94) used 1-2 times a week. Conversely, the participant reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise patterns indicate a strong preference for social physical activity, with frequent exercise with others (Z = 1.23, three times a week or more) contrasting sharply with no solitary exercise (Z = -1.93) and infrequent sports participation. In terms of daily recreation, engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies and reading is minimal (both reported as ""Do not do""), while video game usage is above average (Z = 0.96). Internet usage and socializing with friends are reported at 31 minutes an hour, which is below average relative to the study population. This suggests a selective approach to leisure, prioritizing specific forms of entertainment and social exercise, while generally avoiding sedentary hobbies and solitary physical activity.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits strong and consistent indicators of psychological resilience and well-being. Their notably low scores on depressive symptoms (CESD) and anxiety (STAI), coupled with high self-esteem, high happiness, and high health satisfaction, are all robustly correlated with lower perceived stress in the study population. Their consistently high academic performance also suggests effective functioning and potentially reduced academic stress. Furthermore, both objective and subjective sleep metrics are highly favorable: good self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0, Z = -0.8), above-average sleep duration (8 hours 2 minutes, Z = 1.05), and significantly low variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time. The low variability in sleep patterns, coupled with their positive correlations with PSS (meaning less variability is linked to lower PSS), further support a low-stress profile. While circadian rhythm metrics were nuanced, the observed lower interdaily stability, amplitude, and 24-hour autocorrelation correlated negatively with PSS, implying these specific characteristics are associated with lower perceived stress in this study context. Frequent social exercise and above-average video game engagement, both with weak negative correlations to PSS, also contribute to a lower stress profile.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%):**
There is comparatively less and generally weaker evidence suggesting high perceived stress for this participant. A slightly above-average resting heart rate (Z = 0.27), which positively correlates with PSS (0.14), represents a minor indicator. Similarly, the notably low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z = -1.8) and its positive correlation with PSS (0.16) could point towards higher stress, potentially indicating a less adaptable physiological system or blunted responses. Elevated alcohol consumption, particularly wine/liquor which has a weak positive correlation with PSS (0.03), might also be considered a minor factor. However, these physiological and behavioral indicators for higher stress are limited in number and generally outweighed by the robustness and consistency of the self-reported psychological well-being data.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
Based on a holistic evaluation, the preponderance of evidence, particularly from the self-reported psychological measures (CESD, STAI, self-esteem, happiness), consistently high academic performance, and favorable, regular sleep patterns, strongly indicates that the participant's perceived stress level would be in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The indicators for high stress are fewer, generally weaker in correlation or magnitude, and are significantly counterbalanced by a broad spectrum of indicators suggesting low stress and high psychological well-being.

38815,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by a blend of robust physiological health and active lifestyle, alongside some indications of psychological vulnerability and sleep irregularities. Psychologically, the individual exhibits slightly above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17), classifying them as ""anxious,"" yet depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z-score -0.24), indicating a ""not depressed"" state. Self-reported happiness is notably above average (Z-score 0.55), complemented by significantly high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.05). Academic performance, as reflected by consistent high GPAs, suggests effective management of scholastic demands. A striking feature is the significantly lower-than-average trust score (Z-score -1.42), which, despite its weak correlation with perceived stress, might imply a more guarded or less socially integrated disposition.

Behaviorally, the participant is highly physically active, primarily exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), but engages less in group sports or exercise. Substance use includes above-average beer consumption (Z-score 1.01) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Recreational habits lean towards high internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and listening to music (Z-score 1.13), with less time spent on passive activities like watching TV or playing video games, and also less engagement in reading.

Regarding sleep and circadian rhythms, the participant reports subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 0.13). Objective Fitbit data shows an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 3 minutes, but with significantly higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.8), suggesting inconsistent sleep lengths. Despite this, sleep start times are relatively consistent (Z-score -0.35). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data indicate less regularity in daily physiological patterns, with lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.53). However, the mesor (average heart rate, Z-score -1.1) and resting heart rate (Z-score -1.27) are significantly lower than the population average, pointing to excellent cardiovascular fitness. The participant also displays an above-average amplitude in their heart rate rhythm (Z-score 0.58), suggesting robust physiological responsiveness to daily cycles.

Hourly heart rate data reveal pronounced physiological arousal during specific times, with significantly elevated deviations from the mesor in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM Z-score 2.06, 6-7 PM Z-score 1.65). These robust peaks, in conjunction with an overall low baseline heart rate, suggest a physiological system capable of high output and active engagement rather than chronic over-arousal. The correlations of many of these active-period heart rate deviations with PSS are neutral or negative, reinforcing the interpretation that these represent healthy activity rather than stress-induced physiological strain. The above-average napping frequency (Z-score 0.61) might serve as a compensatory mechanism for the observed inconsistencies in nightly sleep duration.

Overall Ranking of PSS Score:

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators suggesting lower or average levels of perceived stress. They report significantly higher-than-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.05). Depressive symptoms are below the population average (CESD Z-score -0.24) and classified as 'Not depressed'. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.27) and mesor (Z-score -1.1). Furthermore, they engage in high levels of physical activity (exercising alone Z-score 1.07), which is a known buffer against stress. The robust amplitude of their heart rate rhythm (Z-score 0.58) also correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting a healthy physiological response to daily demands. Importantly, the pronounced hourly heart rate deviations during active periods, despite indicating high physiological output, largely exhibit neutral or negative correlations with PSS, implying these peaks are more reflective of healthy activity rather than stress-induced arousal.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several factors point towards potentially elevated perceived stress. The participant's trait anxiety score is slightly above average (STAI Z-score 0.17) and classified as 'anxious', which positively correlates with PSS. Subjective sleep quality is reported as 'Disturbed Sleep' (PSQI Z-score 0.13), and objective data reveals significantly higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.8), suggesting inconsistent sleep patterns that can contribute to stress. Additionally, metrics of circadian rhythm regularity, such as interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.53), are below average, indicating less predictable physiological rhythms, which can be a source of strain. The high internet usage (Z-score 1.52) shows a weak positive correlation with PSS, and the significantly low trust score (Z-score -1.42) could contribute to a generalized sense of vigilance or isolation.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When evaluating the evidence holistically, the participant's profile demonstrates a clear strength in general well-being and physiological resilience, which likely acts as a significant buffer against perceived stress. While there are notable challenges, such as trait anxiety and sleep disturbances, these appear to be counterbalanced by strong protective factors. The participant is happy, satisfied with their health, not depressed, and maintains an excellent level of cardiovascular fitness through consistent physical activity. The physiological system's capacity for high output without broadly correlating with higher perceived stress suggests a robust ability to meet demands. The presence of anxiety and sleep issues, while important, may represent areas of vulnerability within an otherwise resilient framework, rather than indicators of universally high perceived stress. Therefore, despite some contributing factors to stress, the overarching pattern of psychological well-being and physiological health strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level would fall within the lower to average range of the study population.

72885,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a profile indicative of significant psychological strain and behavioral dysregulation. Psychologically, there is an observable elevation in trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 46.0 (Z-score 0.46) categorizing the individual as 'anxious,' a condition positively correlated with higher perceived stress (0.31). While depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD (score 15.0, Z-score 0.18), do not reach a clinical threshold, they are slightly above the population average and also show a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28). Further contributing to this picture is notably lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.01), which, despite a weak negative correlation with PSS, can generally heighten vulnerability to stress. Interestingly, self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), weakly correlating with lower PSS (-0.19), suggesting a nuanced emotional experience where positive affect might co-exist with underlying anxiety, or serve as a compensatory mechanism.

A critical domain of concern is the participant’s profoundly disturbed sleep, a primary indicator of distress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0 (Z-score 1.98) unequivocally classifies the participant as experiencing 'Disturbed Sleep.' This subjective report is substantiated by wearable data, revealing a median sleep duration of only 5 hours 59 minutes (Z-score -1.5), signifying chronic sleep deprivation relative to the study population. The median sleep start time of 3:44 AM further highlights a severe misalignment of the sleep-wake cycle. Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics corroborate this dysregulation: Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.32) is significantly low, reflecting inconsistent daily patterns, and the heart rate rhythm's amplitude (Z-score -1.0) is reduced, indicating a weaker physiological rhythm. Most notably, aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant positive deviations from the mesor during the early morning hours (1-5 AM), with Z-scores ranging up to 2.04. This pattern indicates pronounced physiological arousal during a period typically characterized by deep rest, strongly correlating with higher PSS (0.05 to 0.21). This convergence of evidence strongly points to a severe and chronic sleep disturbance, likely contributing significantly to perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns further contribute to the understanding of the participant's state. Academic performance has shown a consistent decline over recent semesters, with GPA decreasing from 3.19 to 2.77, which often accompanies or reflects elevated academic stress. A striking feature is the significantly elevated use of recreational drugs (Z-score 5.44) and non-prescribed drugs (Z-score 6.84), indicating frequent substance use that, regardless of its weak direct correlation with PSS in this dataset, often serves as a maladaptive coping mechanism for stress or contributes to overall physiological and psychological burden. Engagement in physical activity is notably low, particularly for social exercise (exercised with others Z-score -1.58, sports Z-score -1.09), removing a known protective factor against stress. While social interaction with friends is slightly below average (Z-score -0.62), recreational habits include significantly increased video game usage (Z-score 2.47), which, with a weak negative correlation to PSS (-0.14), might function as an escapist coping strategy to temporarily reduce perceived stress. The participant also reports slightly higher than average reading habits (Z-score 0.32), which may represent another form of coping or self-regulation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant’s overall perceived stress level is likely in the top 50% of the study population.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%):**
The most compelling indicators are the participant's elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46, classified as 'anxious') and severely disturbed sleep patterns. The PSQI score of 11.0 (Z-score 1.98) signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is reinforced by objective wearable data showing chronic sleep deprivation (median sleep duration Z-score -1.5), a severely delayed sleep onset (median sleep start time 3:44 AM), and significant nocturnal physiological arousal (hourly HR deviations 1-5 AM with Z-scores up to 2.04 and positive PSS correlations). Circadian rhythm dysregulation, evidenced by low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.32) and reduced HR amplitude (Z-score -1.0), further points to a system under strain. These physiological and sleep metrics are robustly linked to elevated perceived stress. Behaviorally, the consistent decline in GPA and extremely high frequency of recreational and non-prescribed drug use, while having weak direct PSS correlations in this dataset, frequently indicate maladaptive coping and contribute to an overall heightened state of stress. The significantly low engagement in exercise, particularly social forms, removes a critical stress-buffering activity. Lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) also contributes to vulnerability.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50%):**
Some minor data points might weakly suggest a lower PSS. The CESD score, while slightly elevated, is not classified as depressed. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), with a weak negative correlation to PSS (-0.19). Higher video game usage (Z-score 2.47) also exhibits a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.14), suggesting it might offer temporary stress relief. However, these counter-indicators are either weak in their correlation with PSS or represent potential coping mechanisms that might mask underlying stress rather than negating its presence.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a high level of perceived stress. The participant displays clear psychological vulnerability (anxiety, low self-esteem), profound physiological and behavioral dysregulation (severe sleep disturbance, circadian misalignment, nocturnal arousal), and maladaptive coping strategies (high substance use, low exercise). The decline in academic performance further contextualizes these challenges within an academic environment. While some aspects, like self-reported happiness, seem contradictory, the core indicators of well-being and stress resilience are significantly compromised. Therefore, the participant's overall profile aligns strongly with an elevated experience of perceived stress.

71193,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported data reveal a significant psychological burden, characterized by elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms. The score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is 39.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 2.67, which is classified as ""Depressed"" and is substantially higher than the study population mean. Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 60.0 (Z-score 1.85) is classified as ""anxious,"" indicating elevated chronic anxiety proneness. These findings are further corroborated by a notably low self-reported happiness score (2.0, Z-score -1.61) and a reduced self-esteem score (28.0, Z-score -1.43). Furthermore, the participant reports low trust in others (2.5, Z-score -1.42) and moderate dissatisfaction with health (score 3.56, Z-score -0.53). The strong positive correlations of CES-D (0.28) and STAI (0.31) scores with perceived stress suggest that these psychological vulnerabilities likely contribute to an elevated experience of stress.

Regarding sleep and circadian rhythms, the participant presents a complex pattern. Objective Fitbit data indicate a relatively long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score 1.05) with low variability in both sleep duration (55 minutes standard deviation, Z-score -1.04) and sleep start time (41 minutes standard deviation, Z-score -0.93). The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:47:30. Despite this apparent regularity and duration, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) classifies sleep as ""Disturbed,"" suggesting that the subjective experience of sleep quality is poor. The participant also reports a higher than average frequency of daily naps (Z-score 1.34), which may indicate underlying sleep debt or fragmented nocturnal sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show strong interdaily stability (Z-score 1.57) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.82), alongside low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.24), collectively suggesting a highly regular heart rate rhythm from day to day. However, the acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, is at 5:49 PM, which is comparatively late in the day. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significantly suppressed heart rate levels in the early morning (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score -1.81), followed by pronounced elevations in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 2-3 PM, Z-score 2.28; 3-4 PM, Z-score 2.01). Furthermore, heart rate remains somewhat elevated late into the night (e.g., 11-12 AM, Z-score 1.01), potentially contributing to difficulties winding down despite the apparent objective sleep consistency.

Behavioral habits further delineate aspects of the participant's lifestyle. The participant reports abstaining from substance use, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs. Physical activity levels are notably low, with infrequent exercise (e.g., exercising alone 1-2 times a month, exercising with others ""Not at all,"" and no sports participation). In contrast, engagement in sedentary activities is high, with 1-2 hours daily spent on video games (Z-score 2.47) and other sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41). Socializing with friends is reported at 31 minutes an hour, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.62). These activity patterns, particularly the low physical and social engagement coupled with high sedentary time, may contribute to a sense of stagnation or reduced opportunities for stress relief.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**

A substantial body of evidence points towards the participant likely experiencing elevated perceived stress, placing them in the top 50th percentile of the study population. The most compelling indicators are the self-reported psychological measures. The participant's CES-D score (Z-score 2.67) and STAI score (Z-score 1.85) are both significantly elevated and classified as indicative of ""Depressed"" and ""anxious"" states, respectively. These scores exhibit moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 for CES-D, 0.31 for STAI), suggesting a direct relationship with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, a low self-esteem score (Z-score -1.43) and low happiness (Z-score -1.61) are both weakly but negatively correlated with PSS, meaning these factors are associated with increased stress. The self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score 8.0) is a well-established correlate of increased stress, despite seemingly adequate objective sleep duration. Physiologically, the late acrophase (5:49 PM) and sustained elevated heart rate into the late evening and early morning hours suggest a delayed physiological arousal cycle and potential difficulty achieving relaxation, which can be a manifestation of chronic stress. Lastly, low levels of physical and social activity, coupled with high sedentary behavior, are generally associated with poorer mental well-being and elevated stress.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**

Some physiological and behavioral metrics, while less impactful than the psychological distress indicators, could suggest a tendency towards lower perceived stress. The participant exhibits a highly regular circadian rhythm as indicated by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.57) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.82), along with low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.24). Rhythm regularity is often associated with better health outcomes. Similarly, objective Fitbit data show a relatively long median sleep duration (8 hours 2 minutes, Z-score 1.05) with low variability in both sleep duration and start time, potentially indicating some consistency in daily routine. The participant's resting heart rate is average (Z-score 0.1), and they report no substance use. However, the correlations between these regularity metrics and PSS are weak (e.g., -0.12 for Interdaily Stability, -0.05 for Median Sleep Duration), suggesting they may not exert a strong influence on overall perceived stress in this context.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The overwhelming evidence points towards the participant experiencing a high level of perceived stress. The significantly elevated scores on measures of depression and anxiety, combined with low self-esteem and happiness, are robust indicators of substantial psychological distress. While the participant's circadian rhythm exhibits regularity, the timing of physiological arousal (late acrophase, elevated nocturnal HR) and the subjective experience of disturbed sleep contradict the protective potential of rhythm consistency. The robust and moderately correlated psychological distress measures, in contrast to the weaker and less consistently aligned physiological and behavioral metrics, strongly suggest a PSS score in the higher range of the study population.

98760,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a profile marked by a dichotomy between generally positive self-reported psychological states and significant objective indicators of sleep disturbance and prolonged physiological arousal. Psychologically, the participant demonstrates lower-than-average depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, as indicated by a CES-D score of 7.0 (Z-score -0.66) and a STAI-Trait score of 33.0 (Z-score -0.82), respectively. Furthermore, self-esteem is notably high (44.0, Z-score 0.82), and self-reported happiness (Current 5.0, Z-score 1.64) is significantly elevated compared to the study population. Academically, the participant has maintained a strong performance with GPAs of 4.0 and 3.89. Substance use is entirely absent, with all categories showing usage considerably below the population mean. However, satisfaction with physical health is slightly below average (3.56, Z-score -0.53). While the participant engages in individual exercise frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07), social forms of exercise and sports are completely unengaged.

Despite these indicators of psychological well-being, the participant exhibits clear patterns of disturbed sleep and an atypical physiological rhythm. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) classifies sleep as ""Disturbed,"" indicating substantial subjective difficulties. Objectively, median sleep duration is slightly below the population average at 6 hours 52 minutes (Z-score -0.39), coupled with a notably late median sleep start time of almost 2:00 AM. Additionally, the participant reports above-average mean daily naps (Z-score 0.61), which may compensate for insufficient nocturnal sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics from wearable data reveal a robust heart rate amplitude (Z-score 1.64) and above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.5), suggesting a clear and consistent daily heart rate pattern. However, Intradaily Variability is also elevated (Z-score 0.88), which can indicate fragmentation or rapid shifts in activity/rest states throughout the day, a pattern that correlates positively with perceived stress.

A prominent and potentially impactful pattern emerges from the hourly heart rate data, indicating sustained physiological arousal that extends significantly into the evening and night hours. While the participant's resting heart rate is low (53.05 BPM, Z-score -0.61), suggestive of good cardiovascular fitness, aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show pronounced elevations late in the day. Specifically, heart rate is considerably above the daily average from 6 PM onwards, with very high positive Z-scores observed between 6-7 PM (Z-score 2.03), 7-8 PM (Z-score 1.89), 8-9 PM (Z-score 2.91), 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.68), and 11-12 AM (Z-score 2.28). This suggests a prolonged state of heightened cardiovascular activity or arousal persisting well beyond typical active periods and into the time when the body should be winding down for sleep, likely contributing to the reported sleep disturbance. Concurrently, the participant demonstrates markedly low engagement across a wide range of daily recreational and social activities. Internet usage (Z-score -1.83), listening to music (Z-score -1.19), socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41), and reading (Z-score -0.67) are all considerably below the population mean. This limited repertoire of leisure and social engagement, combined with chronic late-day physiological arousal, indicates a daily routine that may lack sufficient opportunities for restorative rest, varied coping mechanisms, and social connection.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine if the participant’s perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, falls into the top or bottom half of the study population, we consider both converging and diverging lines of evidence. The population's 50th percentile PSS score is 22.0.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**:
The participant's self-reported psychological state paints a picture of relative well-being. Low scores on the CES-D (Z-score -0.66) and STAI-Trait (Z-score -0.82) scales indicate lower depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, which generally correlate positively with PSS. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.82) and significantly elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, a healthy resting heart rate (Z-score -0.61) suggests good cardiovascular fitness, and the participant's strong academic performance and abstinence from substance use indicate aspects of a well-regulated lifestyle.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%)**:
In stark contrast to the self-reported psychological well-being, several robust indicators point towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The most compelling evidence lies in the significant sleep disturbance, with a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), which unequivocally indicates clinically significant sleep problems, a factor strongly linked to higher perceived stress. This is further supported by objective sleep metrics, including a slightly below-average sleep duration and a very late median sleep start time (1:58 AM), which disrupt healthy circadian rhythms. Objectively measured physiological arousal extending late into the evening is also a critical factor; the hourly heart rate deviations show extreme positive Z-scores (up to 2.91) for heart rate elevations during typical winding-down periods, indicating chronic difficulty in achieving physiological rest. Additionally, elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.88), which positively correlates with PSS, suggests fragmented daily activity patterns. Finally, the extremely low engagement in diverse recreational and social activities (e.g., Internet usage Z-score -1.83, Socializing with Friends Z-score -1.41) indicates a restricted range of coping mechanisms and social support, which can be both a cause and consequence of heightened stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**:
While the participant reports low anxiety and depression, and high self-esteem and happiness, the substantial and objective evidence of severe sleep disturbance and prolonged physiological arousal extending late into the night presents a strong counter-narrative. The PSQI score, being more than one standard deviation above the mean, and the significantly elevated evening heart rates, which are extreme outliers compared to the population, are compelling physiological and symptomatic indicators of chronic stress or difficulty regulating physiological responses. These objective and symptom-based measures of dysregulation, combined with a notable lack of diverse recreational and social engagement, suggest that the participant is likely experiencing a significant burden of perceived stress, despite their subjective assessment of emotional states. The physiological and sleep-related challenges are fundamental to daily functioning and are highly associated with stress perception. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

95374,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile, with notable indicators of psychological distress juxtaposed with certain areas of resilience and physiological robustness. From a psychological standpoint, the participant reports elevated depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CESD score of 28.0 (Z-score 1.53), and above-average trait anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 47.0 (Z-score 0.56). These measures show positive correlations with perceived stress. Consistent with these findings, self-reported happiness is notably low (Z-score -1.61), with lower happiness correlating negatively with PSS, suggesting a direct link to increased stress. In contrast, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), a known psychological buffer against stress, and slightly above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.47). Academic performance is consistently strong, with a GPA ranging from 3.65 to 3.75, which could suggest effective academic coping or resilience. Furthermore, the participant demonstrates positive health behaviors by reporting no substance usage across all categories (with negative Z-scores) and high levels of socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74), which indicates a potentially strong social support network.

A pronounced pattern of disturbed sleep and circadian dysregulation emerges from both self-report and wearable data. Subjectively, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. Objectively, while the median sleep duration (7 hours 15 minutes, Z-score 0.09) is average, there is extremely high variability in nightly sleep duration (standard deviation of 219 minutes, Z-score 2.68) and a notably late median sleep start time of 03:11 AM. The high variability in sleep start time (standard deviation of 148 minutes, Z-score 1.43) further underscores significant sleep irregularity. These objective sleep variability metrics, along with a higher-than-average napping frequency (Z-score 1.75), all show positive correlations with PSS, indicating their contribution to higher perceived stress. Despite these behavioral sleep disruptions, certain heart rate-derived circadian rhythm parameters suggest underlying physiological robustness. The participant exhibits a significantly high amplitude in heart rate rhythm (Z-score 2.06) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06), both negatively correlated with PSS, implying these robust characteristics are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z-score 0.42), also negatively correlated with PSS. The participant's resting heart rate (51.4 bpm, Z-score -0.8) is lower than average, often indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, and its positive correlation with PSS suggests lower RHR is linked to lower stress. The mesor (mean heart rate) is 71.57 bpm, with the acrophase (peak activity time) occurring at 7:41 PM, suggesting a robust physiological rhythm, albeit one that is expressed with delayed timing and behavioral irregularity.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. Relative to the mesor, heart rates are significantly elevated during the evening and late-night hours. A substantial peak is observed between 7-8 PM (deviation of 31.09 bpm, Z-score 3.42), with elevations persisting into the early morning (e.g., 12-1 AM deviation of 12.47 bpm, Z-score 2.04; 2-3 AM deviation of 3.76 bpm, Z-score 2.30). This pattern suggests sustained physiological activity or arousal during periods typically associated with winding down and sleep onset, which is consistent with the very late and irregular sleep patterns. Conversely, heart rates are notably lower than average during late morning and early afternoon, sometimes even falling below the participant’s resting heart rate, suggesting periods of very low activity or profound rest during these times. Behaviorally, the participant reports no engagement in exercise across all categories (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93), which is a deviation from typical health-promoting behaviors that often mitigate stress. Leisure activities include higher-than-average time spent watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.28) and notably high engagement in video games (Z-score 2.47), which, with its negative correlation with PSS, may serve as a personal coping or distraction mechanism for perceived stress. The combined pattern of limited physical activity and prolonged evening physiological arousal, despite average overall sleep duration, points to a potentially challenging balance between daily demands and restorative processes.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological distress is a primary indicator of elevated perceived stress. They exhibit significant depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 1.53, classified as 'Depressed') and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.56, classified as 'anxious'), both of which correlate positively with PSS. Furthermore, a notably low level of self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) is observed, with lower happiness correlating with higher PSS. Sleep patterns are profoundly disrupted, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), indicating clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance. Objectively, there is extreme variability in nightly sleep duration (Z-score 2.68) and high variability in sleep start time (Z-score 1.43), both strongly and positively correlated with PSS. The very late median sleep start time of 03:11 AM and higher-than-average napping frequency (Z-score 1.75, positively correlated with PSS) reinforce a pattern of severe sleep-wake cycle dysregulation. Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal pronounced elevations during late evening and into the early morning hours, peaking exceptionally high between 7-8 PM (Z-score 3.42) and maintaining significant elevation around midnight and 2-3 AM. This pattern of prolonged physiological arousal during typical rest periods strongly aligns with and likely exacerbates perceived stress and sleep disturbances. The complete lack of reported physical exercise across all categories (all Z-scores below -1.0) also represents the absence of a commonly recognized and effective stress-buffering behavior.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Several factors suggest potential resilience or elements that could mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), which is negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a protective psychological resource. Consistent high academic performance (GPA ranging from 3.65 to 3.75) suggests effective management of academic demands. Engagement in social activities is high (socializing with friends Z-score 1.74), and substance usage is notably low across all categories, reflecting positive health behaviors. Physiologically, certain heart rate-derived circadian metrics suggest a robust underlying system. The heart rate rhythm exhibits a significantly high amplitude (Z-score 2.06) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06), both negatively correlated with PSS, implying these characteristics are typically associated with lower perceived stress. The participant also has a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.8), often associated with good cardiovascular fitness and lower physiological stress, and its positive correlation with PSS further implies that a lower RHR is linked to lower PSS. High engagement in video games (Z-score 2.47), with a negative correlation with PSS, might serve as an effective coping mechanism for some individuals, contributing to lower stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates several protective factors, including high self-esteem, robust social engagement, low substance use, consistent academic performance, and underlying physiological markers of a strong circadian rhythm and good cardiovascular fitness, the overwhelming evidence points to a state of elevated perceived stress. The significant and co-occurring self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety, and low happiness, combined with profound and highly variable sleep disturbances—both subjective (PSQI) and objective (extreme variability in sleep duration and timing, late sleep onset, frequent napping)—strongly indicate high perceived stress. These factors, particularly the sleep dysregulation metrics, exhibit substantial Z-scores and direct positive correlations with PSS. The observed pattern of prolonged physiological arousal extending into the late night and early morning, coupled with the complete absence of physical exercise, further supports a lifestyle that likely contributes to heightened perceived stress, overriding the benefits of inherent physiological robustness. Therefore, the combined weight of evidence from psychological distress, behavioral sleep dysregulation, and late-night physiological arousal strongly suggests the participant's perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

71985,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates generally average levels of internalizing symptoms within the student population. The Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) score of 14.0 (Z=0.07) falls within the ""Not depressed"" range and is consistent with the population mean. Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 41.0 (Z=-0.03), while classified as ""anxious,"" is also representative of the average trait anxiety level for the study group. Both CESD and STAI show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress. In contrast, self-reported happiness is above average (Z=0.55), weakly correlating with lower stress. However, self-esteem is somewhat lower than the population mean (Z=-0.59), and satisfaction with physical health is significantly below average (Z=-1.2), indicating potential areas of concern that could contribute to perceived stress, despite weak or negligible correlations with PSS for these specific metrics. Academically, the participant experienced a notable decline in GPA from 3.62 to 3.3 across two fall semesters, which could serve as an additional stressor.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates healthy patterns regarding substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for all categories, which aligns with significantly lower usage than peers and generally supports overall well-being. Physical activity is a prominent aspect of their routine, with individual exercise occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z=1.07), suggesting a higher engagement in solo physical activity compared to peers. Social exercise and sports participation are at average levels. Conversely, the participant allocates substantial time to screen-based recreational activities, engaging in ""1-2 hours"" of watching TV/videos (Z=1.28) and ""1-2 hours"" of video games (Z=2.47), the latter being exceptionally high relative to the study population. While high video game usage shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, potentially serving as a coping mechanism or leisure outlet, these sedentary activities represent a significant portion of daily recreation.

Sleep patterns, both self-reported and objectively measured, are generally indicative of good quality and duration. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z=-0.8) classifies the participant as having ""Good Sleep,"" reflecting better subjective sleep quality than average. Fitbit data corroborates this with a median sleep duration of ""7 hours 18 minutes"" (Z=0.14), slightly exceeding the population mean. While there is slightly above-average variability in sleep duration (Z=0.17) and sleep start time (Z=0.35), which weakly positively correlates with perceived stress, the overall consistency is supported by the absence of daily napping (Z=-0.86).

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a highly robust and well-regulated cardiovascular system, characterized by impressive circadian rhythm stability and lower baseline arousal. Interdaily Stability (Z=2.07) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z=1.74) are significantly higher than average, indicating exceptional regularity in daily heart rate patterns. A strong Amplitude (Z=1.01) further suggests a clear and healthy oscillation between activity and rest. Crucially, both the Mesor (mean heart rate, Z=-1.04) and Resting Heart Rate (Z=-0.97) are substantially lower than population averages, indicative of superior cardiovascular fitness and lower chronic physiological stress. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct diurnal fluctuations, with deep physiological recovery during nighttime hours (e.g., -24.87 bpm from mesor between 5-6 AM) and pronounced peaks during daytime activity. Notably, heart rate deviations are significantly elevated during specific periods, such as 1-2 PM (Z=1.88) and 7-8 PM (Z=1.5), exceeding peer averages, suggesting intense physiological activity or arousal during these times. These strong physiological indicators, including high regularity, low baseline heart rate, and robust rhythms, generally correlate negatively with perceived stress, implying a protective physiological profile.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**:
The participant presents a compelling physiological profile strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Their Resting Heart Rate (Z-score: -0.97) and Mesor (Z-score: -1.04) are both significantly below the population mean, indicating superior cardiovascular fitness and lower chronic physiological arousal, which are typically protective against high stress. Moreover, objective measures of circadian rhythm demonstrate exceptional regularity and robustness, with Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 2.07) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 1.74) being remarkably high, and Amplitude (Z-score: 1.01) above average. These strong physiological rhythm metrics exhibit negative correlations with PSS, directly linking better physiological regulation to lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -0.8) and maintains an objectively above-average median sleep duration (7 hours 18 minutes, Z-score: 0.14). High engagement in individual exercise (Z-score: 1.07) is another significant stress-buffering behavior. On the self-report side, depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: 0.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.03) are within the average range for the student population, not indicating elevated distress compared to peers. Finally, above-average self-reported happiness (Z-score: 0.55) and the complete absence of substance use further support a profile less indicative of high perceived stress.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%)**:
Several factors might contribute to elevated perceived stress for this participant. Self-reported satisfaction with physical health is notably low (Z-score: -1.2), and self-esteem is below average (Z-score: -0.59), both of which could represent chronic internal stressors, although their correlations with PSS are weak. The participant also experienced a decline in academic performance, with a GPA drop from 3.62 to 3.3, which could be a source of academic pressure or stress. While overall sleep is good, there is slightly above-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 0.17) and sleep start time (Z-score: 0.35), which are weakly positively correlated with PSS, suggesting minor irregularities could be linked to slightly higher stress. The presence of significant peaks in hourly heart rate deviations, particularly at 1-2 PM (Z=1.88) and 7-8 PM (Z=1.5), indicates periods of high physiological arousal that, in some individuals, might be stress-induced. However, for this participant, these peaks are more likely reflective of robust physical activity or a healthy physiological response given their excellent overall cardiovascular health and strong circadian rhythms.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**:
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the predominant evidence strongly suggests that this participant’s perceived stress level would fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution. The participant demonstrates remarkable physiological resilience, characterized by superior cardiovascular health (low resting heart rate, low mesor) and exceptionally stable and robust circadian rhythms. These objective physiological markers, which are generally inversely correlated with perceived stress, provide a strong foundation against high chronic stress. Coupled with good subjective and objective sleep quality and duration, a high level of physical exercise, and average levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety relative to peers, these factors create a protective profile. While areas such as low health satisfaction, lower self-esteem, and a declining GPA present potential stressors, they are substantially outweighed by the robust physiological and behavioral indicators of well-being and stress resilience. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant experiences relatively low or average perceived stress compared to their peers.

The participant's psychological profile reveals significant indicators of distress, with self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD score 37.0, Z-score 2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI score 53.0, Z-score 1.16) both notably elevated relative to the study population. These measures show a moderate positive correlation with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), suggesting they are associated with higher perceived stress levels. Concurrently, self-esteem (score 33.0, Z-score -0.73), current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), and health satisfaction (score 3.33, Z-score -0.7) are all reported as below average, with each correlating negatively with PSS, indicating that lower levels in these domains tend to be associated with higher perceived stress. Trust in others is close to the population average. This constellation of self-reported psychological states strongly points towards a heightened state of psychological vulnerability and distress.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, evidenced by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52). This subjective poor sleep quality contrasts somewhat with objective wearable data showing slightly above-average median sleep duration (7 hours 28 minutes, Z-score 0.35) and relatively consistent sleep duration (standard deviation of 72 minutes, Z-score -0.66) and start times (standard deviation of 45 minutes, Z-score -0.82) compared to the population. However, the participant also reports more frequent daily naps (Z-score 0.82), which, combined with the poor subjective quality, may suggest compensatory behavior for inadequate restorative sleep. The median sleep start time of 2:00 AM is later than typical, which could impact overall sleep architecture and daytime functioning.

The participant's lifestyle and behavioral habits are characterized by elevated substance use and a lack of physical activity. Recreational drug use is notably high (Z-score 5.44), with beer and wine/liquor consumption also above average. These behaviors, while showing minimal direct correlation with PSS in this dataset, can often serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms or contribute to overall psychological burden. Exercise engagement is significantly low across all categories (Z-scores for exercising alone, with others, and sports are all well below zero), which is generally associated with poorer stress management. Daily recreational activities show high engagement in passive screen-based activities like watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.28) and video games (Z-score 1.71), while engagement in socializing and reading is below average. Notably, a lack of reading correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21), suggesting that this participant's absence of reading may be associated with higher perceived stress.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological measures indicates a relatively structured circadian rhythm, with average interdaily stability and slightly below-average intradaily variability. The heart rate Mesor (mean heart rate across the day) is slightly above average (78.48 bpm, Z-score 0.62), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly elevated (14.99 bpm, Z-score 1.36). A higher amplitude often reflects a robust distinction between active and rest phases, and here it negatively correlates with PSS (-0.16), potentially indicating a physiological characteristic that, in some contexts, may be protective against stress. Resting heart rate is slightly below average (54.8 bpm, Z-score -0.4), which is generally considered healthy.

However, a closer examination of the mean aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a distinct pattern of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits uncharacteristically elevated heart rates above the Mesor during the early night (12-2 AM, Z-scores 1.67 and 1.53), which is a period typically associated with physiological wind-down and sleep onset. This suggests difficulty in achieving physiological relaxation early in the sleep cycle. Heart rates then drop significantly below the Mesor during the core sleep hours (3-7 AM) as expected, but the morning rise in heart rate is notably delayed, with values remaining significantly below the Mesor until late morning (e.g., 9-10 AM, Z-score -2.3). The afternoon sees a sharp increase in heart rate above the Mesor, and importantly, heart rate remains consistently and significantly elevated throughout the evening hours (from approximately 7 PM until midnight), with several hours showing Z-scores above 1.3. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, is observed at 6:29 PM, consistent with these elevated evening values. This sustained evening physiological arousal suggests a prolonged state of activation, potentially indicating challenges in unwinding and contributing to the subjectively reported disturbed sleep quality and overall psychological distress, despite some weakly negative correlations with PSS for individual hourly deviations.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

The most compelling evidence for a high PSS score stems from the participant's self-reported psychological and mental health status. The CESD score of 37.0 (Z-score 2.47) indicates clinically significant depressive symptoms, and its positive correlation with PSS (0.29) strongly suggests a link to elevated perceived stress. Similarly, the STAI score of 53.0 (Z-score 1.16) points to elevated trait anxiety, which also correlates positively and strongly with PSS (0.32). These two measures alone provide substantial support for a high PSS. Further, the PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) signifies significant subjective sleep disturbance, a common correlate of heightened stress. Lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.73), happiness (Z-score -0.53), and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7) are all negatively correlated with PSS, implying that these deficits are associated with higher perceived stress. Behaviorally, the extremely high recreational drug use (Z-score 5.44) and pervasive lack of physical exercise, while showing minimal direct correlations, are generally associated with poorer coping and increased psychological distress. The absence of reading, which correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21), also suggests a missing coping resource. Physiologically, the pattern of sustained elevated heart rate into the late evening and early night suggests difficulty with physiological relaxation, which can contribute to subjective feelings of stress and poor sleep, even if individual hourly deviations show weaker or counter-intuitive correlations.

**Evidence for Low/Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Some physiological metrics might initially suggest a lower perceived stress. The participant exhibits relatively consistent sleep duration and start times, with lower standard deviations than the population average. A slightly below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.4), while generally a marker of good cardiovascular fitness, is paradoxically weakly positively correlated with PSS (0.14), making its interpretation complex in this context. The high circadian amplitude (Z-score 1.36), which indicates a clear distinction between peak and trough heart rate, correlates negatively with PSS (-0.16), suggesting that this physiological robustness *could* be associated with lower perceived stress. However, this correlation is moderate and needs to be weighed against stronger indicators. Average interdaily stability and slightly below-average intradaily variability in heart rate are also generally considered positive indicators of circadian health. High engagement in video games (Z-score 1.71) shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.14), implying that this activity might act as a distraction or coping mechanism that reduces perceived stress for this individual.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

Despite some physiological indicators suggesting a degree of circadian rhythmicity and a relatively healthy resting heart rate, the overwhelming evidence points towards a high level of perceived stress for this participant. The self-reported psychological measures (CESD, STAI, self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) are all strongly aligned with elevated distress and show significant correlations with PSS. The clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance further supports this. The participant's behavioral patterns, including extremely high recreational drug use and a pronounced lack of exercise, indicate a lifestyle that is unlikely to mitigate stress effectively and may even exacerbate it. The distinct physiological pattern of prolonged evening and early-night heart rate elevation suggests persistent physiological arousal, which is inconsistent with healthy stress management and relaxation. Therefore, the combined and weighted evidence, particularly from the robust self-report measures, strongly indicates that the participant's perceived stress level is likely in the top half of the study population distribution.

98117,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant's psychological profile reveals significant elevations in distress and anxiety, coupled with diminished psychological well-being. Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) are markedly elevated at 33.0 (Z-score: 2.05), classifying the participant as ""Depressed"" and indicative of a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. Similarly, trait anxiety, as assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI–Trait), is high at 53.0 (Z-score: 1.16), classifying the participant as ""anxious"" and suggesting a chronic predisposition to anxiety. These findings are further supported by notably lower-than-average self-esteem (Score: 32.0, Z-score: -0.87), significantly reduced self-reported happiness (Current: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), and lower satisfaction with physical health (Score: 3.0, Z-score: -0.95). Additionally, the participant reports very low levels of trust in others (Score: 2.17, Z-score: -2.07). The observed positive correlations between CES-D and STAI scores with PSS in the study population suggest that these elevated psychological distress indicators are likely associated with higher perceived stress for this individual.

Both self-reported and wearable-derived data consistently highlight significant sleep disturbances. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" reflecting subjective difficulties. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours 37 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.71). More critically, the participant exhibits exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 234 minutes, Z-score: 3.02) and an extremely high variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 280 minutes, Z-score: 4.33). The median sleep start time is notably late at 04:03:17 AM. Both the high standard deviations in sleep duration and sleep start time show positive correlations with PSS (0.14 and 0.18 respectively), strongly linking these objective markers of irregular sleep to increased perceived stress. This pattern suggests a severely disrupted and inconsistent sleep-wake cycle.

Physiological data from the wearable device indicate patterns of cardiovascular activity that may reflect heightened arousal and a dysregulated circadian rhythm. The participant's resting heart rate is elevated at 66.4 bpm (Z-score: 0.98), a metric positively correlated with PSS (0.14). While the interdaily stability of heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.08), the intradaily variability is notably low (Z-score: -1.73), suggesting a reduced dynamic range or flexibility in physiological responses throughout the day; this lower variability correlates positively with PSS (0.16). The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.96), with an acrophase (peak activity) occurring in the early evening at 6:27 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal significant decreases during early morning hours (e.g., -16.19 bpm at 6-7 AM) and substantial increases during late afternoon/early evening (e.g., +14.24 bpm at 5-6 PM). The positive correlations of hourly heart rate deviations with PSS are most pronounced during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-6 AM), suggesting that the irregularity in physiological rhythms, even during periods of lower heart rate, is associated with higher perceived stress.

An examination of behavioral habits reveals a predominantly sedentary lifestyle characterized by extensive screen time and minimal social engagement or physical activity. The participant reports no usage of substances, including alcohol or drugs. All forms of exercise (alone, with others, or sports) are reported as ""Not at all,"" with significantly low Z-scores across these categories. Conversely, the participant dedicates considerable time to sedentary recreational activities: 2-3 hours watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.91), 31 minutes per hour playing video games (Z-score: 1.71), and over 4 hours using the internet (Z-score: 2.19). Time spent socializing with friends is exceptionally low (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -2.2), and reading is not engaged in. This combination of physical inactivity, social isolation, and extensive screen-based recreation points to behavioral patterns that can often coexist with or contribute to elevated psychological distress. Despite these challenges, the participant's academic performance, as reflected by an improving GPA from Fall 2015 (3.17) to Fall 2016 (3.59), suggests a capacity for academic progress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant likely experiences a high level of perceived stress, placing them within the top 50% of the study population. This is supported by several key findings:
*   **Psychological Distress:** Both depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 2.05) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.16) are significantly elevated and positively correlated with PSS.
*   **Reduced Well-being:** Self-esteem (Z-score: -0.87), happiness (Z-score: -1.61), and health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.95) are markedly lower than average, factors typically associated with higher perceived stress. Trust in others is also very low (Z-score: -2.07).
*   **Severe Sleep Disturbance:** Both subjective sleep quality (PSQI score: 8.0) and objective wearable data reveal profound sleep issues. Critically, the extremely high variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 3.02) and sleep start times (Z-score: 4.33) are strongly and positively correlated with PSS (0.14 and 0.18, respectively). The median sleep duration is also below average.
*   **Physiological Arousal:** The participant exhibits an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.98), which positively correlates with PSS (0.14). Additionally, a notably low intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: -1.73), indicative of reduced physiological flexibility, also positively correlates with PSS (0.16).
*   **Social Isolation:** Extremely limited social engagement (socializing with friends Z-score: -2.2) is a known factor that can exacerbate or contribute to stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards a low or median PSS score is limited and weak in comparison to the indicators for high stress:
*   **Absence of Substance Use:** The participant reports no usage of alcohol or recreational drugs. While generally a positive health behavior, in the context of pervasive psychological distress and social isolation, this alone does not strongly indicate low perceived stress.
*   **Average Circadian Stability:** The interdaily stability of heart rate is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.08), with a weak negative correlation to PSS. This suggests some consistency in overall daily heart rate patterns, but is overshadowed by the high variability in sleep-specific metrics.
*   **Improving Academic Performance:** An upward trend in GPA across semesters suggests some level of effective academic functioning, but this does not negate the presence of significant perceived stress in other areas of life.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that this participant experiences a high level of perceived stress. The concurrent and significant elevations in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, profound deficits in self-esteem and happiness, objectively measured severe sleep disturbances with extreme variability, and an elevated resting heart rate—all of which are positively correlated with higher PSS scores—form a compelling pattern of elevated psychological and physiological stress. The observed social isolation and lack of physical activity further contribute to this picture. While the absence of substance use and an improving GPA are positive aspects, they are insufficient to counterbalance the extensive and impactful indicators of high stress identified across multiple psychological, physiological, and behavioral domains. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

24883,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile. Psychologically, there is evidence of strong self-esteem (Z-score 1.52) and lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.45), indicating a relative resilience in these domains. However, trait anxiety is slightly elevated (STAI Z-score 0.07, classified as ""anxious""), suggesting a predisposition to anxiety. Subjective well-being appears compromised, with self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7) both below the population average. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance, maintaining GPAs near 4.0. Behaviorally, the participant exhibits significant withdrawal from physical and social activities. Exercise frequency is markedly low, particularly in social contexts (Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58), and involvement in sports is absent. Similarly, engagement in social activities with friends is considerably below average (Z-score -1.41), and participation in other recreational hobbies is minimal. Moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for beer and wine/liquor) is noted as above the population average, while other substance use is absent. This pattern suggests a lifestyle characterized by high academic focus but limited social interaction, physical activity, and diverse leisure pursuits. The participant's Body Mass Index (BMI) of 16.84 indicates they are underweight, which is a physical health consideration.

Physiological and circadian data reveal a significant pattern of dysregulation. While the resting heart rate (52.2 bpm, Z-score -0.71) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 69.03 bpm, Z-score -0.67) are lower than the population average, suggesting good baseline cardiovascular health, the hourly heart rate profile indicates substantial physiological arousal during typical rest periods. Specifically, heart rate deviations from the mesor are exceptionally high from 11 PM to 3 AM, with Z-scores peaking at 2.82 between 2-3 AM. This implies significant cardiovascular activity and arousal during hours usually dedicated to deep sleep and recovery. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, is observed late in the evening at 7:01 PM, further supporting a delayed physiological rhythm. Circadian rhythm metrics also show lower-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.99), indicating less regularity in daily activity patterns, and notably low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.31), suggesting fewer transitions between activity and rest states within a day. A dampened heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.11) further points to a less dynamic physiological response to daily rhythms.

Sleep patterns represent a critical area of concern, aligning strongly with the physiological data. Despite a consistent sleep duration (SD Z-score -0.3) that is only slightly below average (median duration 6 hours 53 minutes, Z-score -0.38), the median sleep start time is exceptionally late at 3:00 AM. This profoundly delayed sleep phase is highly anomalous within the study population. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite a Z-score of -0.33 which suggests it is less severe than the average for disturbed sleepers within the population. The objective heart rate data, showing marked physiological activation during late night and early morning hours, strongly corroborates this pattern of sleep disturbance and delayed sleep onset. The combination of an extremely late sleep schedule and objective nocturnal arousal indicates a chronic disruption to the participant's sleep-wake cycle, likely contributing to a state of sustained physiological and psychological strain.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several characteristics that would typically be associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.45) are below average, indicating a healthier mental state in this domain, which has a positive correlation with PSS. A significantly high self-esteem (Z-score 1.52) acts as a protective psychological factor, weakly negatively correlated with PSS. Excellent academic performance (consistent GPA of ~3.9-4.0) suggests effective coping with academic demands, potentially reducing a common source of student stress. Physiologically, a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.71) and Mesor (Z-score -0.67) indicate good baseline cardiovascular health, generally linked to lower physiological stress. The participant also demonstrates consistent sleep duration with low variability (SD Z-score -0.3), which can provide a degree of predictability to their routine. Additionally, lower intradaily variability (Z-score -1.31) is weakly correlated with lower PSS. While the PSQI score of 6.0 is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" its negative correlation with PSS (-0.33) might, if taken at face value, suggest it is associated with lower perceived stress; however, this specific correlation is considered cautiously given the objective evidence of severe sleep disruption.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, a substantial body of evidence points towards elevated perceived stress. The participant's trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.07, classified as ""anxious"") is slightly above average and is moderately positively correlated with PSS, indicating a higher general propensity for stress. Subjective well-being is diminished, with lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS. The most compelling evidence lies in the profound sleep disturbance and circadian dysregulation: a median sleep start time of 3:00 AM is exceptionally late, and objective heart rate data shows significant physiological arousal (Z-scores up to 2.82) during typical sleep hours (11 PM - 3 AM). This chronic and severe disruption to the sleep-wake cycle is a major physiological stressor strongly associated with heightened perceived stress. The low interdaily stability (Z-score -0.99) suggests a lack of routine, which can contribute to stress, and is weakly negatively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, the participant's significant social (Z-score -1.41) and physical activity (Z-score -1.58 for social exercise) withdrawal represents a lack of crucial coping mechanisms and social support, often contributing to increased stress. A low heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.11) may also suggest blunted physiological responsiveness, which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS. Lastly, the underweight BMI (16.84) indicates a physiological health concern that could be related to or exacerbated by chronic stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits notable strengths in academic performance, self-esteem, and lower depressive symptoms, these are substantially overshadowed by objective and subjective indicators of chronic stress. The severely delayed sleep phase, characterized by an exceptionally late sleep onset and significant physiological arousal during typical rest periods, represents a pervasive and impactful stressor. This profound circadian disruption, coupled with elevated trait anxiety, diminished happiness and health satisfaction, and a marked withdrawal from social and physical activities, collectively points to a state of heightened perceived stress. Despite some protective factors and good baseline cardiovascular health, the cumulative burden of sleep deprivation, physiological strain, and social isolation makes it highly probable that the participant experiences elevated perceived stress.

66815,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile generally indicative of positive well-being and adaptive coping strategies. Self-reported measures show low depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and average trait anxiety (STAI score of 41.0, Z-score -0.03) when compared to the study population. Notably, the participant reports significantly higher self-esteem (score 42.0, Z-score 0.54) and marked happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64). These indicators, particularly high happiness which negatively correlates with PSS, suggest a robust psychological buffer against stress. Health satisfaction is average (score 4.0, Z-score -0.2). Academic performance is consistently strong, with GPAs near 3.9 across multiple semesters, suggesting effective academic functioning and potentially well-managed academic demands.

Lifestyle behaviors further support a pattern of health-conscious choices. The participant reports no substance usage across categories including beer, wine/liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs, with all Z-scores being significantly negative (e.g., Beer usage Z-score -1.12, Wine/Liquor Z-score -1.3). While engagement in exercise alone and sports is infrequent, the participant regularly engages in exercise with others (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.23), indicating an active social component to physical activity. Daily recreational habits are characterized by very low engagement in common activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing, and reading. Most of these activities are reported as ""Do not do"" or for very short durations (e.g., Internet usage 16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.16), suggesting either a highly focused academic schedule or engagement in unmeasured leisure activities. The low engagement in typically sedentary or social recreational activities (e.g., socializing Z-score -1.41) is a notable deviation from the population mean.

Sleep quality and patterns appear to be quite healthy. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0, with a Z-score of -0.8, classifies the participant as having ""Good Sleep"" and is below the typical threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Fitbit data corroborates this, showing a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 6 minutes, which is average (Z-score -0.11). More significantly, sleep consistency is high, with a notably low standard deviation for sleep duration (40 minutes, Z-score -1.38) and sleep start time (56 minutes, Z-score -0.6). These values indicate highly regular sleep habits, with minimal day-to-day variability in both the amount of sleep obtained and bedtime. Napping is not reported. High sleep consistency, in particular, is generally associated with better health outcomes and potentially lower stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors demonstrate a well-regulated cardiovascular and circadian rhythm profile. The participant exhibits a significantly low resting heart rate (45.8 bpm, Z-score -1.47), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm analysis reveals a low Mesor (average heart rate of 64.28 bpm, Z-score -1.32) and a substantially high amplitude (15.84, Z-score 1.64), signifying a pronounced and healthy fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates over a 24-hour cycle. The Interdaily Stability (0.51, Z-score 0.83) is above average, reflecting consistent daily patterns in heart rate, while Intradaily Variability (0.6, Z-score 0.39) is slightly above average, suggesting some degree of within-day fragmentation or activity changes. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 5:29 PM. The aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate this rhythm, with the lowest deviations (indicative of deepest rest) occurring in the early morning hours (e.g., -28.06 from 4-5 AM, -27.14 from 5-6 AM). Conversely, the highest deviations (indicative of peak physiological arousal/activity) are observed in the late afternoon and evening, with a particularly pronounced peak from 5-6 PM (38.42, Z-score 4.07) and another elevated period from 9-10 PM (25.2, Z-score 3.01). The significant amplitude and stability, combined with a low resting heart rate, suggest a robust and healthy physiological regulation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the available multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would likely place them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution.

Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):
*   **Psychological Well-being:** The participant reports significantly high happiness (Z-score 1.64) and above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.54), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS. Depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.03) are average or below average, with positive correlations to PSS, further indicating lower stress.
*   **Sleep Quality and Consistency:** Excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) and high objective sleep consistency (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score -1.38, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score -0.6) are observed. PSQI and sleep duration variability are positively correlated with PSS, meaning better sleep and more consistent sleep are associated with lower PSS.
*   **Cardiovascular Health and Circadian Rhythm:** A very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.47) and low Mesor (Z-score -1.32) suggest good cardiovascular fitness, both weakly positively correlated with PSS, thus favoring lower PSS. The high amplitude (Z-score 1.64) of the circadian rhythm is negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a more robust physiological rhythm linked to lower stress. Above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.83) also correlates negatively with PSS, further supporting lower stress.
*   **Lifestyle:** The complete absence of substance use (multiple negative Z-scores > 1.0) and engagement in exercise with others (Z-score 1.23) are generally protective factors against elevated stress.

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50%):
*   There is very little compelling evidence to suggest a high PSS score. Intradaily Variability is slightly above average (Z-score 0.39) and positively correlated with PSS, which could weakly suggest slightly higher stress. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average (Z-score -0.78) and negatively correlated with PSS, which could also weakly imply higher stress. However, these factors are not extreme and are largely outweighed by the overwhelming evidence for lower stress. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.2) and negatively correlated with PSS, but this deviation is minor. The low engagement in many recreational activities, while potentially unusual, does not directly correlate strongly with higher PSS in a consistent manner to override other strong indicators.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the holistic analysis, the participant exhibits a constellation of psychological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics strongly associated with lower perceived stress. This includes high happiness and self-esteem, good sleep quality and regularity, excellent cardiovascular fitness with a robust circadian rhythm, and an absence of substance use. The few indicators that might weakly point towards higher stress are marginal compared to the pronounced evidence for lower stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents with a notably positive psychological profile, characterized by robust mental well-being indicators. Self-report measures reveal significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score (Z = -0.97) classifying the participant as ""Not depressed."" Similarly, trait anxiety, as assessed by the STAI, is notably low (Z = -1.02), indicating the participant is ""not anxious."" This positive psychological state is further reinforced by elevated self-esteem (Z = 1.52), high self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64), and strong satisfaction with physical health (Z = 1.38), all of which typically correlate with lower levels of perceived stress. Academically, the participant maintains a strong GPA, providing additional context to their overall functioning.

Sleep patterns, both subjectively and objectively measured, appear to be a protective factor for this individual. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (Z = -0.8) indicates ""Good Sleep"" quality. This subjective report is supported by Fitbit data showing a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 26 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z = 0.32). Critically, the participant demonstrates high consistency in their sleep schedule, with significantly lower standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z = -0.94) and sleep start time (Z = -0.79). The absence of daily naps (Z = -0.86) further suggests a consolidated and regular nighttime sleep routine, contributing to a stable physiological baseline.

The participant exhibits a highly engaged and active social and recreational lifestyle. Daily habits include significantly elevated time spent on internet usage (Z = 1.52), listening to music (Z = 2.06), and socializing with friends (Z = 2.53), suggesting rich engagement in leisure and social activities. Exercise habits are moderate, with engagement in exercising alone (Z = 0.32) and sports (Z = 0.25). A particularly salient finding, however, is the exceptionally high reported frequency of recreational drug usage (""1-2 times a week""), which registers an extreme Z-score of 5.44 relative to the study population. While the correlation of this behavior with perceived stress (0.05) is modest, its extreme nature warrants noting as a significant behavioral pattern that may carry inherent risks or reflect underlying factors, even if not directly manifesting as increased perceived stress according to this dataset's correlations with PSS.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a generally lower average heart rate profile, with a mesor (average heart rate over time; Z = -0.86) and resting heart rate (Z = -0.51) both below the population mean. While Interdaily Stability (Z = -0.16) is near the population average, indicating consistent day-to-day rhythmicity, Intradaily Variability (Z = 1.3) is elevated, suggesting greater moment-to-moment fluctuations in heart rate. The circadian amplitude (Z = -0.33) is slightly lower than average, which, given its negative correlation with PSS, could imply some blunting of the physiological stress response or a less robust rhythm. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals typical daily patterns, with lowest values during early morning sleep. However, there are notable elevations in heart rate deviation during the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 10-11 PM, Z = 1.65; 11-12 AM, Z = 1.29; 12-1 AM, Z = 0.9). Despite these elevated activity levels in the late evening, the provided correlations indicate that higher heart rates during these specific times are associated with *lower* perceived stress in the study population, suggesting these physiological activations might be linked to active, possibly social or recreational, late-night engagement rather than physiological distress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Based on a holistic analysis of the multimodal data, the participant’s overall perceived stress level (as measured by the PSS domains) would most likely place them in the **bottom half** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for lower perceived stress comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. Scores on the CESD (Z = -0.97) and STAI (Z = -1.02) are significantly below the population average, indicating minimal depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Both scales show positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31, respectively), meaning lower scores are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (Z = 1.52) and happiness (Z = 1.64), which are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15 and -0.19, respectively), thus also pointing towards lower stress. High health satisfaction (Z = 1.38) similarly aligns with lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is reported as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z = -0.8), and objective Fitbit data indicates highly consistent sleep duration (Z = -0.94) and sleep start times (Z = -0.79), with these measures of stability correlating positively with PSS. Therefore, greater consistency in sleep points to lower perceived stress. The participant also exhibits a lower overall heart rate profile (Mesor Z = -0.86, Resting Heart Rate Z = -0.51), generally consistent with a less stressed physiological state. The cumulative weight of these strong self-report and consistent sleep metrics, directly tapping into the *perception* of stress, provides substantial evidence for a PSS score in the lower distribution.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting potentially higher perceived stress is less pervasive. The participant exhibits elevated Intradaily Variability (Z = 1.3), which has a positive correlation with PSS (0.16), indicating a higher degree of physiological fragmentation that is associated with greater stress. Additionally, the circadian amplitude is slightly lower than average (Z = -0.33), and its negative correlation with PSS (-0.17) implies that a lower amplitude is associated with higher perceived stress. The most striking behavioral outlier is the extremely high frequency of recreational drug usage (Z = 5.44). While its direct correlation with PSS is low (0.05), such an extreme behavior could reflect coping mechanisms for unacknowledged stress or introduce new stressors, even if not strongly captured by the provided PSS correlations for the general population.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are some physiological indicators (elevated Intradaily Variability, lower Amplitude) and a significant behavioral anomaly (recreational drug use) that could be associated with higher perceived stress, the overwhelming strength and consistency of the self-reported psychological well-being measures (low depression, low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, high health satisfaction) are paramount for evaluating *perceived* stress. The participant's subjective experience, supported by good sleep quality and consistent sleep patterns, strongly aligns with a resilient and less stressed profile. Given that the Perceived Stress Scale directly assesses an individual's self-reported perception of stress, the extensive evidence from these psychological and behavioral self-reports outweighs the physiological and behavioral anomalies in determining the likely PSS group for this individual.

14847,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and notable irregularities in physiological rhythm and social cognition. Self-report data indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score 24.0, Z-score 1.11, classified as Depressed) and anxiety proneness (STAI score 50.0, Z-score 0.86, classified as anxious), both of which show positive correlations with perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), classifying sleep as ""Disturbed."" This self-reported sleep disturbance is supported by objective wearable data showing below-average median sleep duration (6 hours 38 minutes, Z-score -0.69) and high variability in both sleep duration (134 minutes, Z-score 0.75) and sleep start times (104 minutes, Z-score 0.46) relative to the study population. The participant also reports a significantly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 1.9), suggesting an inability to maintain consistent restorative sleep.

Further physiological insights from wearable data reveal a striking lack of stability in the participant's daily heart rate patterns. Intradaily Variability is exceptionally high (0.83, Z-score 2.01), indicating frequent and substantial fluctuations in physiological arousal throughout the day, which can be indicative of dysregulation. Conversely, Interdaily Stability (0.35, Z-score -0.49) is slightly below average, suggesting some inconsistency in daily routines. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:43 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates pronounced nocturnal bradycardia, with mean heart rate dipping significantly during early morning hours (e.g., -22.49 bpm from mesor between 5-6 AM, -21.81 bpm between 6-7 AM). However, heart rate remains elevated into the late evening, peaking at 14.3 bpm above mesor between 7-8 PM, and staying notably high until late night (8.15 bpm above mesor between 10-11 PM). This pattern suggests prolonged physiological activation during waking hours and potentially insufficient physiological recovery before the onset of sleep, which aligns with the reported sleep disturbances.

In terms of social and self-perception, the participant displays a remarkably low trust score (1.67, Z-score -3.03), placing them far below the population mean for trust in others. This extreme interpersonal stance, while weakly correlated with PSS, may contribute to overall psychological burden. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45), while self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.97) are somewhat above average, despite the documented psychological and physiological challenges. Behavioral patterns include above-average engagement in recreational drug use (Z-score 1.61) and a preference for exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), with no reported exercise with others or participation in sports. Daily recreation habits show higher than average time spent watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, alongside above-average socializing, but no reading. The academic performance, as reflected by GPA, appears generally stable, though GPA in Fall 2016 (3.2) is slightly lower than in Spring 2016 (3.62).

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.97) are above the population average. Higher values in these domains are weakly negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting a potential mitigating factor against high perceived stress. The resting heart rate (Z-score 0.03) and mesor (Z-score 0.1) are approximately average, which could suggest no chronic physiological hyperarousal, although their correlations with PSS are very weak and positive. The participant also engages in exercise alone at an above-average frequency (Z-score 1.07) and reports above-average socializing (Z-score 0.95), both of which are generally considered stress-buffering behaviors.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Multiple core psychological and physiological indicators strongly suggest an elevated level of perceived stress. The participant reports significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 1.11, classified as ""Depressed"") and chronic anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score 0.86, classified as ""anxious""), both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31, respectively). Subjective sleep quality is severely disturbed (PSQI Z-score 1.52), and objective sleep metrics show below-average duration, high variability, late sleep onset, and a very high frequency of napping (Z-score 1.9), all of which are highly consistent with increased stress. Physiologically, the exceptionally high Intradaily Variability (Z-score 2.01) points to significant autonomic dysregulation, a common correlate of stress. Furthermore, the pattern of prolonged elevated heart rate in the evening hours and a late acrophase suggest a potential difficulty in physiological deactivation and recovery. The remarkably low trust score (Z-score -3.03) indicates a significant psychological challenge in interpersonal relations, which can contribute to stress. Higher recreational drug use (Z-score 1.61) might also be a coping mechanism for underlying stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite some indicators of higher happiness and health satisfaction, the overwhelming evidence points towards a high level of perceived stress. The profound psychological distress (depression, anxiety), severe sleep disturbance (subjective and objective), and significant physiological dysregulation (high intradaily variability, prolonged evening heart rate elevation) are strongly associated with and predictive of elevated perceived stress. The moderate positive correlations of CESD and STAI scores with PSS further reinforce this interpretation. The participant's profile is characterized by multiple, interconnected challenges that typically contribute to a heightened experience of stress.

43382,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological indicators that collectively suggest a significant degree of psychological distress and physiological arousal. Self-reported data reveal a notable pattern of internalizing symptoms, with scores indicating a classification of ""Depressed"" on the CES-D scale (Score 28.0, Z-score 1.53) and ""anxious"" on the STAI-Trait scale (Score 46.0, Z-score 0.46). Both of these measures show positive correlations with perceived stress. Furthermore, self-esteem is notably lower than the population average (Score 32.0, Z-score -0.87), a factor often inversely associated with stress levels. Contradictory to these indicators of distress, the participant reports high levels of current happiness (Current 5.0, Z-score 1.64) and satisfaction with physical health (Score 5.89, Z-score 1.22), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. This suggests a potential disconnect between symptom reporting and overall subjective well-being, or the presence of effective coping mechanisms that maintain aspects of positive affect despite underlying psychological burden.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle is characterized by low engagement in physically active and social pursuits. There is a consistent report of ""Not at all"" for all exercise categories (Exercised Alone, Exercised with Others, Sports), with very low Z-scores (e.g., -1.93 for Exercised Alone). Socializing with friends is also reported at a very low frequency (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41), which is positively correlated with PSS. Internet usage is also exceptionally low (15 minutes or less, Z-score -1.83). While substance use is minimal across all categories, suggesting a lack of maladaptive coping in this area, the overall pattern points to a sedentary lifestyle with limited social interaction. The participant's Body Mass Index (17.85) falls into the underweight category, which could be an indicator of general health or lifestyle factors, though no PSS correlation is provided for this metric. These behavioral patterns, particularly the lack of physical and social activity, are generally associated with poorer mental health and higher stress.

Sleep patterns for this participant are notably disrupted and irregular. Fitbit-derived data indicate a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes (Z-score -1.27), which is negatively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, both sleep duration (120 minutes, Z-score 0.44) and sleep start time (101 minutes, Z-score 0.39) exhibit higher-than-average variability, with both being positively correlated with PSS. The median sleep start time is also late, at 01:28:09. This constellation of short, inconsistent sleep duration and timing points to a chronically disturbed sleep schedule, a common correlate of elevated perceived stress.

Physiological data reveal a heightened state of cardiovascular arousal. The participant's Mesor, representing the mean heart rate across the recording period, is elevated (83.24 bpm, Z-score 1.27), as is the Resting Heart Rate (63.4 bpm, Z-score 0.62). Both of these metrics are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting a higher baseline physiological stress response. Circadian rhythm metrics present a mixed picture: while interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.73) are slightly above average, indicating some regularity in the overall heart rate rhythm (which is negatively correlated with PSS), intradaily variability is below average (Z-score -0.74), suggesting less fluctuation in activity levels throughout the day and positively correlated with PSS. The acrophase (peak activity time) at 4:54 PM is within a normal range. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show typical nocturnal drops and diurnal rises, although some evening hours exhibit lower average deviations compared to peers, potentially indicating reduced evening activity or arousal. The primary physiological indicators, Mesor and RHR, strongly suggest elevated physiological activation.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits several significant markers consistently associated with elevated perceived stress. Critically, scores on the CES-D scale (1.53 Z-score) indicating depressive symptoms and the STAI-Trait scale (0.46 Z-score) indicating anxiety proneness are both above average and strongly positively correlated with PSS. Lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.87) also aligns with higher stress. Behaviorally, the profound lack of exercise (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93) and significantly limited social engagement (Socializing with Friends Z-score -1.41) are major lifestyle factors often contributing to increased stress, and these metrics show positive correlations with PSS. Sleep data strongly support higher stress, with significantly short median sleep duration (Z-score -1.27) and high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.44) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.39), all having correlations consistent with elevated PSS. Physiologically, an elevated Mesor (Z-score 1.27) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.62) indicate heightened physiological arousal, both positively correlated with PSS. The lower intradaily variability (Z-score -0.74), reflecting less daily activity fluctuation, is also positively correlated with PSS.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Contrary evidence includes the participant's high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS. Low substance usage (e.g., Beer Z-score -1.12) could be considered a positive health behavior. Circadian rhythmicity, as indicated by slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.73), are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting some underlying biological regularity that might mitigate stress. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is average (Z-score -0.05), which is negatively correlated with PSS.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite the self-reported high happiness and health satisfaction, the preponderance and magnitude of evidence point towards a high level of perceived stress for this participant. The strong indicators of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with severe sleep disturbance (short duration and high variability), a highly sedentary lifestyle, limited social engagement, and elevated physiological arousal (Mesor and RHR), collectively represent a substantial burden. While the positive self-reports are noteworthy, the overall profile is dominated by factors robustly linked to elevated perceived stress. The significant Z-scores and correlation strengths for measures like CES-D, STAI, sleep metrics, and physiological arousal weigh heavily in this assessment. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

75438,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant's data presents a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological markers, offering a multimodal view of their perceived stress and overall well-being.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally resilient psychological disposition, characterized by lower-than-average scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.52), indicating a classification of ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" relative to the study population. Additionally, their self-reported health satisfaction is notably higher than the population mean (Z-score 0.63). However, there are areas of psychological vulnerability; self-esteem is lower than average (Z-score -0.73), and self-reported happiness is somewhat reduced (Z-score -0.53). A significant concern arises from academic performance, with a notable decline in GPA from 3.47 in Spring 2016 to 2.7 in Fall 2016, which represents a substantial academic setback and potential stressor.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in exercise alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91), both exceeding population averages. Social engagement is also robust, with 2-3 hours spent socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95). These activities are generally considered beneficial for stress management. Conversely, there is elevated substance use, particularly with wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) and recreational drugs (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score 1.61), with both instances notably higher than the population mean. While individual correlations with perceived stress are weak for these substances, their elevated usage could suggest coping mechanisms or additional behavioral stressors.

Sleep patterns appear significantly disturbed. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance according to the PSQI (score 6.0) and demonstrates a markedly low median sleep duration of 6 hours 2 minutes (Z-score -1.43). The median sleep start time is late (01:43:30), but the variability in sleep start time is lower than average (Z-score -0.38), suggesting a consistent, albeit late, bedtime. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data reveals a lower-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.66), indicating less regularity in daily physiological rhythms. However, intradaily variability is also lower than average (Z-score -1.09), suggesting a more consolidated activity-rest pattern, and 24-hour autocorrelation is slightly above average (Z-score 0.31), reflecting a reasonably robust underlying daily periodicity. The mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.61) and amplitude (Z-score -0.08) are within healthy ranges, with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring at 3:28 PM.

Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate (53.0 bpm, Z-score -0.61) is considerably lower than the population mean, indicative of strong cardiovascular health and a baseline of physiological resilience. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest rates during the early morning. Heart rate increases significantly during the day, peaking between 12 PM and 3 PM, where deviations from the mesor reach up to 18.23 bpm with Z-scores as high as 2.07. This suggests periods of intense physiological activity or arousal during these hours. In the evening, a notable reduction in heart rate deviation between 6-8 PM (Z-scores down to -1.6) indicates a pronounced physiological wind-down. While a low resting heart rate is a positive health indicator, the combination of sustained high daytime heart rate deviations and severe sleep deprivation suggests that the participant may be under chronic physiological demand without adequate recovery.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits several factors that typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD) and trait anxiety (STAI) are below the population average, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" both of which are moderately correlated with lower PSS scores. Physiologically, their resting heart rate and mesor heart rate are lower than the population mean, suggesting good cardiovascular fitness and a resilient physiological baseline. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as lower intradaily variability and higher 24-hour autocorrelation, also indicate a structured and consistent physiological rhythm, generally associated with better stress regulation. Furthermore, the participant reports higher satisfaction with their physical health and actively engages in regular exercise and social activities, which are known to be protective against stress. A relatively consistent sleep start time, despite being late, also points to some routine.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, significant and impactful stressors are evident. The participant's self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score 6.0) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, and their objectively measured median sleep duration is severely short at 6 hours 2 minutes (Z-score -1.43). Chronic sleep deprivation is a potent physiological and psychological stressor that profoundly impacts cognitive function and emotional regulation. This is further corroborated by a substantial decline in academic performance, with their Fall 2016 GPA dropping significantly. Lower self-esteem and reduced current happiness, as observed, are also psychological vulnerabilities that can amplify the perception of stress. Additionally, higher-than-average usage of alcohol and recreational drugs might serve as coping mechanisms or contribute to existing stress. While the strong physiological baseline could allow for resilience, the chronic nature of these demands, particularly severe sleep debt and academic pressure, are direct and powerful contributors to heightened perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates a resilient psychological trait profile and robust physiological markers suggesting a capacity to cope, the presence of severe, multifaceted, and acute stressors strongly indicates an elevated level of perceived stress. The clinically significant sleep disturbance, critically short sleep duration, and the substantial decline in academic performance represent profound real-world challenges that are highly likely to be appraised as overwhelming and uncontrollable. These objective stressors, combined with lower self-esteem and happiness, suggest that despite their underlying resilience and positive health behaviors, the participant is currently operating under considerable strain. The PSS measures how situations in one's life are appraised as stressful, and the current circumstances of severe sleep debt and academic difficulty are compelling evidence for a heightened perception of stress. Therefore, the weight of evidence points towards the participant likely having a PSS score in the upper half of the study population.

99733,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"This participant's psychological and physiological profile presents a nuanced picture, characterized by a generally positive self-reported psychological state contrasted with subtle indicators of physiological strain and less robust circadian rhythm. Self-report measures suggest a favorable psychological landscape; the participant scored low on the CES-D (Z-score -0.86) and STAI-Trait (Z-score -1.02), classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Their self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (Z-score -1.26), is categorized as ""Good Sleep,"" and they report above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55). However, self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) are somewhat below average, suggesting minor areas of psychological vulnerability. The academic performance, indicated by a declining GPA trend across semesters (3.15 to 2.9), could represent a source of underlying academic pressure.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a healthy lifestyle concerning substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for all categories, with correspondingly low Z-scores. Exercise habits involve moderate engagement in exercising alone (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.32), but less participation in group exercise or sports. Daily recreation indicates a relatively low engagement in many common leisure activities, notably ""Do not do"" for video games and listening to music, and very low internet usage (Z-score -1.16) and socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41). Conversely, reading is slightly above average (Z-score 0.32), and this habit has the strongest negative correlation with perceived stress among recreational activities, suggesting it might serve as an effective coping mechanism.

Physiological data reveal some patterns indicative of greater strain. The participant's Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.09) is significantly above the population mean, suggesting less stable and more fragmented physiological rhythms throughout the day, a factor positively correlated with perceived stress. Similarly, their Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.53) is slightly elevated, and this also positively correlates with higher PSS. Further, the circadian rhythm displays a slightly attenuated amplitude (Z-score -0.43) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.53), both of which are associated with higher perceived stress. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate typical diurnal fluctuations, with elevated heart rates during midday (e.g., 11 am - 1 pm, Z-scores 1.08) reflecting periods of higher cardiovascular activity. A notably sharp decline in heart rate is observed in the late evening (9-11 pm, Z-scores -1.48 and -1.69), suggesting a robust winding down towards rest. Objectively, sleep duration is slightly below average (median 6 hours 43 minutes, Z-score -0.58), although the self-reported sleep quality (PSQI) is good. The standard deviations for sleep duration and start time are slightly below average, indicating moderate consistency in sleep patterns.

Overall, the participant displays a self-reported psychological resilience, reflected in low scores on anxiety and depression measures, and good subjective sleep quality. These self-reported psychological health indicators are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. However, objective physiological data from wearables suggest an underlying pattern of less stable physiological rhythms and slightly elevated baseline arousal, which are typically associated with higher perceived stress. The declining GPA and limited social engagement might also contribute to subtle stressors not fully captured by self-reported psychological scales. Considering the PSS assesses *perceived* stress, the participant's strong self-reported psychological well-being and good subjective sleep quality are powerful counter-indicators against high perceived stress, despite the physiological markers suggesting some objective strain. The correlations with PSS show that lower CESD, STAI, and PSQI scores are consistently associated with lower PSS, and these are significantly low for this participant. Therefore, it is more likely that their perception of stress is lower.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Based on the available evidence, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is likely to place them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution with regards to their PSS score.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological health. They report very low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D score 5.0, Z-score -0.86), low trait anxiety (STAI score 31.0, Z-score -1.02), and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 4.0, Z-score -1.26). These measures are significantly below the population average for negative states and are classified as ""not depressed,"" ""not anxious,"" and ""Good Sleep"" respectively. The correlations between these scores and PSS are positive for CES-D (0.28) and STAI (0.31), meaning lower scores on these scales predict lower PSS. The negative correlation for PSQI (-0.1) means a lower PSQI score (better sleep) also predicts lower PSS. Additionally, the participant reports above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS, further suggesting lower perceived stress. Their avoidance of substance use also points to generally healthy coping.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards a higher PSS score primarily stems from objective physiological measures. The participant exhibits significantly elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.09), which reflects less stable physiological rhythms and positively correlates with PSS (0.16). Their Resting Heart Rate is also slightly above average (Z-score 0.53) and positively correlated with PSS (0.14). Furthermore, slightly lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) could contribute to higher perceived stress, though their correlations with PSS are weaker. The decreasing trend in GPA over semesters, while not directly correlated with PSS, could also represent an underlying academic stressor.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there is a notable discrepancy between the participant's strong self-reported psychological well-being (suggesting lower stress) and their physiological markers of strain (suggesting higher stress), the PSS is a measure of *perceived* stress. The participant's very low scores on scales directly assessing anxiety, depression, and subjective sleep quality are strong indicators of a favorable psychological state and would typically translate to a lower *perception* of stress. The significant negative Z-scores for CES-D, STAI, and PSQI, coupled with their consistent correlations with PSS, strongly support the conclusion that the participant perceives less stress than the average student. While physiological markers indicate objective load, the absence of perceived distress in self-report is more directly aligned with how PSS is interpreted.

27407,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable levels of trait anxiety and significant subjective sleep disturbance, alongside indicators of robust physiological regulation and positive health behaviors. Psychologically, the participant reports an elevated level of trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86), placing them in the ""anxious"" classification within the study population. This finding is particularly salient given the positive correlation of STAI with perceived stress. In contrast, depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, appear to be within the average range (score 13.0, Z-score -0.03), suggesting that depression is not a primary concern compared to anxiety. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with perceived stress, but this coexists with moderately lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.31) and slightly lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.53). The consistently high GPA (ranging from 3.74 to 3.94) across multiple semesters indicates strong academic performance, which, while an achievement, can also be associated with academic pressure.

Sleep patterns represent a significant area of concern for this participant. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating substantial subjective sleep difficulties and poor overall sleep quality. This is objectively supported by wearable data, which shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score -1.17), significantly below the population average and indicative of chronic sleep deprivation. The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:02:30 AM. Despite this late onset, the standard deviation of sleep start time is relatively low (51 minutes, Z-score -0.71), suggesting consistency in their late sleep schedule rather than erratic timing. Sleep duration variability is average (Z-score 0.43). The presence of significant subjective sleep disturbance and objectively short, late sleep suggests a potential contributor to elevated perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices present a picture of underlying cardiovascular fitness and relatively robust circadian rhythmicity. The participant's resting heart rate (RHR) is remarkably low at 46.3 bpm (Z-score -1.41), and the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is also low (65.18 bpm, Z-score -1.2). These metrics typically suggest good cardiovascular health and fitness. Furthermore, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm exhibits an above-average amplitude (12.22, Z-score 0.47) and above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.39), with slightly below-average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.25). These indicate a well-defined and stable daily heart rate rhythm, generally considered a marker of physiological resilience. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs at 5:46 PM, aligning with peak activity in the late afternoon/early evening. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show clear physiological troughs during early morning sleep (reaching -29.03 bpm below Mesor between 5-6 AM) and peaks during the evening (up to 22.38 bpm above Mesor between 8-9 PM), further supporting a distinct daily pattern of arousal and rest. Despite these indicators of physiological robustness, the poor subjective sleep quality suggests a disconnect between objective physiological regulation and subjective experience.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in several positive health habits. Substance usage is minimal, with beer consumption at 1-2 times a month and no reported use of wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is notable, with regular engagement in exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports (all 1-2 times a week, with sports showing an especially high Z-score of 0.91). High levels of physical activity are generally associated with lower stress. Daily recreational habits include above-average time spent reading (Z-score 0.32), a behavior often linked to stress reduction, and minimal time spent watching TV/videos or socializing with friends, which are generally associated with slightly higher PSS. Internet usage is average. The participant's lifestyle thus includes several protective factors that typically mitigate stress, contrasting with the self-reported psychological and sleep-related distress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine whether the participant’s overall perceived stress level places them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, a holistic assessment of the available evidence is necessary.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

1.  **Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI):** The participant’s STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86) classifies them as ""anxious,"" which is a strong indicator of chronic anxiety proneness. This measure has a moderate positive correlation (0.31) with the PSS, suggesting that higher trait anxiety is typically associated with higher perceived stress.
2.  **Significant Subjective Sleep Disturbance (PSQI):** A PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) signifies ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating substantial difficulties with sleep quality and related issues. Poor sleep quality is a well-established contributor to perceived stress, and this metric typically correlates positively with PSS.
3.  **Insufficient Sleep Duration:** The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score -1.17) is considerably below the population average, indicating chronic sleep deprivation. Lack of adequate sleep is a common stressor and exacerbates feelings of perceived stress.
4.  **Very Late Sleep Onset:** A median sleep start time of 02:02:30 AM, while consistent, represents a significantly delayed sleep schedule. Such a pattern can contribute to challenges in aligning with daily academic and social demands, potentially increasing perceived stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Average PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

1.  **Low Depressive Symptoms (CESD):** The CESD score of 13.0 (Z-score -0.03) suggests depressive symptoms are not a significant concern for this participant relative to the population. Lower depressive symptom burden is generally associated with lower PSS.
2.  **Above-Average Happiness:** The self-reported happiness score (Z-score 0.55) is above average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19), suggesting a buffering effect against stress.
3.  **Low Substance Usage:** The participant reports very low or no use of various substances, which is generally associated with healthier coping mechanisms and lower PSS.
4.  **High Physical Activity:** Engaging frequently in exercise and sports (e.g., Sports Z-score 0.91) is a well-known stress-buffering behavior, and sport frequency has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.13).
5.  **High Reading Time:** Above-average time spent reading (Z-score 0.32), a behavior negatively correlated with PSS (-0.21), serves as a positive coping strategy.
6.  **Robust Physiological Indicators:** The very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.41) and Mesor (Z-score -1.2) suggest good cardiovascular fitness. The high amplitude (Z-score 0.47) and high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.39) of the heart rate circadian rhythm, both negatively correlated with PSS, indicate physiological resilience and a well-structured daily rhythm. Lower intradaily variability (Z-score -0.25) also correlates with lower stress.
7.  **High Academic Achievement:** Consistently high GPA demonstrates academic competence, which can be a source of self-efficacy, though it may also be linked to pressure.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant exhibits numerous robust physiological and behavioral buffers against stress, including excellent cardiovascular fitness, a stable circadian rhythm, high levels of physical activity, and low substance use, these appear insufficient to fully mitigate their *perceived* psychological distress. The self-reported trait anxiety (STAI) is substantially elevated, and the subjective experience of sleep (PSQI) is severely disturbed, both of which are strongly correlated with PSS scores in the population and represent direct measures of psychological well-being. Objectively short sleep duration further reinforces the potential for elevated stress. The high academic achievement, while positive, might also contribute to underlying pressure or anxiety. Given that PSS measures *perceived* stress, the significant and direct indicators of anxiety and poor sleep quality carry substantial weight. Despite the protective factors, the presence of markedly elevated anxiety and sleep disturbance makes it highly probable that the participant experiences and *perceives* stress at a level higher than the average study population.

43794,26.0,0.927461139896373,"The participant's data reveals a profile indicative of elevated perceived stress, characterized by significant psychological vulnerabilities, chronic physiological arousal, pronounced circadian rhythm disruption, and inconsistent sleep patterns. While some behaviors suggest potential coping mechanisms, the overall picture points towards a high stress burden.

Psychologically, the participant demonstrates a high level of trait anxiety, as evidenced by a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 55.0, which corresponds to a Z-score of 1.35 and classifies them as ""anxious."" This pervasive anxiety is further compounded by a lower self-esteem score (32.0, Z-score -0.87) and reduced self-reported happiness (3.0, Z-score -0.53). Although symptoms of depression, as measured by the CES-D, are below the clinical threshold (10.0, Z-score -0.34), the combination of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and diminished happiness suggests a compromised state of mental well-being. The participant also reports significantly low satisfaction with their physical health (2.33, Z-score -1.45), indicating a potential area of concern or dissatisfaction. A notable decline in academic performance, with the GPA decreasing from 3.87 to 3.33 across recent academic semesters, could also be a reflection of increased academic pressure or the impact of their psychological state.

Physiologically, the data points to chronic sympathetic arousal and a profoundly disrupted circadian rhythm. The participant's resting heart rate of 70.8 bpm (Z-score 1.50) is notably elevated compared to the study population, serving as a key indicator of heightened physiological stress. Analysis of circadian rhythms reveals significant irregularities: Interdaily Stability (0.2, Z-score -1.73) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.23, Z-score -0.78) are both well below average, indicating poor day-to-day regularity in physiological patterns. Furthermore, the Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (5.34, Z-score -1.76) is markedly low, suggesting a flattened physiological response curve with less robust daily fluctuations, a common finding in individuals experiencing chronic stress or fatigue. The acrophase, or the time of peak physiological activity, occurs relatively late at 5:00 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate typical nocturnal deceleration but with a delayed recovery and sustained positive deviations into the evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM), further supporting an irregular daily physiological profile.

Sleep quality and regularity represent another critical area of concern. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59), which exceeds the clinical threshold for significant sleep disturbance. Objective Fitbit data corroborates these concerns, demonstrating high variability in both sleep duration (Standard Deviation 156 minutes, Z-score 1.25) and sleep start times (Standard Deviation 122 minutes, Z-score 0.86). While the median sleep duration (6 hours 59 minutes, Z-score -0.24) is only slightly below average, the significant inconsistency in sleep timing strongly suggests a lack of a stable sleep schedule, which can detrimentally impact perceived stress and overall well-being. The median sleep start time of 01:02:54 indicates a tendency towards a late sleep onset.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant reports above-average consumption of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94), which could potentially be a coping mechanism, though its direct correlation with perceived stress is weak. Engagement in physical activity shows a mixed pattern, with infrequent individual exercise but more regular participation in group exercise (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53). A prominent recreational habit is significantly high engagement in listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), which may serve as a primary relaxation or distraction strategy. However, engagement in other common leisure activities such as reading, video games, or sedentary hobbies is minimal or absent, suggesting a potentially limited repertoire of diverse coping or recreational strategies.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that the participant experiences elevated levels of perceived stress, likely placing them in the top half of the study population's PSS distribution.
1.  **Elevated Trait Anxiety:** The participant's STAI score (Z-score 1.35) is indicative of chronic anxiety, a robust predictor and component of perceived stress. The correlation with PSS is positive (0.31).
2.  **Physiological Arousal:** A significantly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.50) is a direct physiological marker of chronic stress, positively correlated with PSS (0.13).
3.  **Profound Circadian Rhythm Dysregulation:** Multiple measures reflect significant disruption: very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.73), low Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.78), and very low Amplitude (Z-score -1.76). These metrics are negatively correlated with PSS (ranging from -0.11 to -0.17), meaning poorer rhythmicity and blunted physiological range are associated with higher perceived stress.
4.  **Poor and Irregular Sleep:** The PSQI score (8.0) denotes clinically significant sleep disturbance. Furthermore, highly variable sleep duration (Z-score 1.25) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.86) are objective indicators of an inconsistent sleep schedule, both positively correlated with PSS (0.13 and 0.17, respectively).
5.  **Negative Affect and Self-Perception:** Lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.87), reduced happiness (Z-score -0.53), and significantly low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.45) all align with a profile of increased psychological distress and, by extension, higher perceived stress.
6.  **Academic Decline:** The observed decrease in GPA suggests potential difficulties in coping with academic demands, which can be a significant source or outcome of stress in a university population.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a low or median perceived stress score is limited in scope and overshadowed by the counter-evidence.
1.  **Low Depressive Symptoms:** The CES-D score (Z-score -0.34) indicates a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms. Given its positive correlation with PSS (0.28), a lower CES-D score would suggest a lower PSS. This is the strongest piece of evidence against high perceived stress.
2.  **Average Intradaily Variability:** The Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.03) is within the average range. While positively correlated with PSS (0.16), this average score does not contribute to an elevated PSS.
3.  **Near-Average Median Sleep Duration:** The median sleep duration (Z-score -0.24) is only slightly below average. However, the high variability in sleep timing is a more impactful factor when considering overall sleep health and stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
A comprehensive evaluation of the multimodal data strongly suggests that the participant experiences elevated perceived stress. The significant presence of high trait anxiety, chronic physiological arousal (elevated resting heart rate), extensive disruption in circadian rhythms, and both subjective and objective indicators of poor and irregular sleep collectively point towards a high stress burden. Furthermore, lower self-esteem, reduced happiness, and dissatisfaction with health satisfaction reinforce this conclusion. While the absence of clinical depression symptoms is a mitigating factor, it is insufficient to counterbalance the multitude of other robust and highly correlated indicators of increased perceived stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

51437,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a distinct profile characterized by generally positive self-reported psychological well-being and high levels of physical activity, alongside significant objective indicators of physiological arousal and sleep disturbance. Self-report measures indicate a favorable psychological state, with depressive symptoms (CESD score 4.0, Z-score -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI score 35.0, Z-score -0.62) both falling below the population average. Additionally, the participant reports notably high self-esteem (Score 45.0, Z-score 0.96) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Score 4.67, Z-score 0.3). Academic performance, as reflected by a consistent GPA above 3.69, is strong. Lifestyle behaviors include a high engagement in exercise, both alone (Z-score 1.07) and through sports (Z-score 1.58), indicating a very active physical regimen compared to peers. Recreational substance use is reported as low, with alcohol consumption occurring 1-2 times a month and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. While overall happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), self-reported social engagement and other recreational activities appear within typical ranges, except for significantly less engagement in listening to music (Z-score -1.19) and reading (Z-score -0.67).

Despite these indications of psychological resilience and adaptive coping strategies, objective wearable data reveal pronounced patterns of physiological dysregulation and disturbed sleep. The participant's circadian rhythm exhibits elevated intradaily variability (Value 0.76, Z-score 1.51) and reduced interdaily stability (Value 0.31, Z-score -0.82), suggesting a fragmented and less regular daily physiological pattern. Cardiovascular metrics are particularly notable: the average heart rate (Mesor) is significantly elevated (Value 83.43 bpm, Z-score 1.29), as is the resting heart rate (Value 73.0 bpm, Z-score 1.77). This elevated baseline physiological activity is a strong indicator of chronic arousal. Furthermore, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly reduced (Value 5.87, Z-score -1.59), implying a flattened daily heart rate profile with less distinct peaks and troughs, which can signal insufficient physiological recovery. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 7:39 PM.

Detailed hourly heart rate data underscore the extent of physiological arousal, particularly during the early morning hours. The deviation of mean heart rate from the mesor is extremely high between 12-1 AM (Value 25.6, Z-score 3.91) and significantly elevated between 1-2 AM (Value 6.63, Z-score 2.04). These patterns indicate substantial cardiovascular activity during a period typically dedicated to rest and recovery, reinforcing the presence of heightened physiological arousal that extends into the early hours of the day.

Sleep statistics from wearable data align with a pattern of disturbed sleep. The participant records a median sleep duration of 6 hours 15 minutes, which is significantly shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.16). Sleep initiation consistently occurs very late, with a median sleep start time of 02:14:30. While this late start time is consistent (sleep start time standard deviation Z-score -1.12), the consistently short duration suggests inadequate sleep opportunity or efficiency. These objective sleep metrics are largely consistent with the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, which classifies sleep as ""Disturbed,"" despite its Z-score (-0.33) being slightly below the population mean, suggesting that relative to their peers, their subjective sleep quality might not be perceived as dramatically worse, but the absolute measure indicates clinically relevant disturbance. Correlations between these physiological and sleep metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) are generally modest but directionally consistent, with higher resting heart rate, mesor, and intradaily variability positively correlating with PSS, and lower amplitude and interdaily stability negatively correlating, further supporting the interpretation of these factors as potential indicators of stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data provides a mixed but ultimately compelling picture regarding the participant's perceived stress level.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several factors commonly associated with lower perceived stress. Self-reported survey data indicate below-average levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62), both of which typically correlate positively with PSS. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) is generally a protective factor against stress. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, suggesting effective management of academic demands, a common stressor for university students. Furthermore, a very high engagement in exercise and sports (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58, respectively) represents a significant and effective coping mechanism for stress. While the PSQI score classifies sleep as ""Disturbed,"" the Z-score (-0.33) is slightly below the population average, implying that subjectively, the participant's sleep quality might not be perceived as poorer than many of their peers, despite the absolute score indicating clinical relevance.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Despite the positive self-report on psychological traits and high activity levels, the objective physiological and sleep data strongly suggest a state of chronic physiological arousal and inadequate recovery. The participant's resting heart rate (Z-score 1.77) and average heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.29) are significantly elevated, indicating a heightened baseline physiological state. The significantly reduced amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Z-score -1.59) points to a flattened daily physiological profile, signifying reduced capacity for physiological recovery. Most strikingly, hourly heart rate deviations show extremely elevated values in the very early morning hours (12-1 AM Z-score 3.91, 1-2 AM Z-score 2.04), a period when the body should be in a state of deep rest. This robust physiological activation during rest periods is a profound indicator of chronic strain. Furthermore, sleep is objectively significantly short (median 6 hours 15 minutes, Z-score -1.16), and circadian rhythms exhibit high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51), suggesting fragmented and less regular daily physiological patterns, which are often associated with stress. The correlations, though modest, support these physiological indicators as being associated with higher PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant's profile reveals a notable discrepancy between subjective psychological well-being and objective physiological and behavioral indicators. While self-reported measures suggest a resilient individual with good coping mechanisms and effective management of academic and social demands, the wearable data presents compelling evidence of significant chronic physiological arousal and disturbed sleep. The magnitude of the physiological aberrations, particularly the extremely elevated resting heart rate, flattened circadian rhythm, and profoundly increased heart rate during early morning hours, outweighs the positive self-reported psychological characteristics. Chronic physiological activation and insufficient sleep are fundamental components of the stress response and typically correlate with higher perceived stress, even if the individual psychologically manages the emotional experience of stress effectively. Therefore, despite exhibiting strong psychological coping, the substantial physiological burden indicates that the participant likely experiences an elevated level of perceived stress compared to their peers.

21932,13.0,0.023316062176165803,"The analysis of the participant's multimodal data reveals a complex interplay of psychological resilience, structured behavioral patterns, and specific physiological arousal patterns, which collectively inform an understanding of perceived stress.

**Psychological Well-being and Lifestyle Patterns**
The participant demonstrates a remarkably robust psychological profile characterized by significantly low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, as indicated by a CESD score of 4.0 (Z-score -0.97) and a STAI score of 28.0 (Z-score -1.31), respectively. Both scores fall well below the population average, suggesting a reduced propensity for experiencing negative affective states typically associated with elevated stress. This is further reinforced by a notably high self-esteem score of 50.0 (Z-Score 1.66), indicating a strong sense of self-worth and competence. Academically, the participant maintains an excellent GPA across multiple semesters (ranging from 3.86 to 4.0), suggesting effective coping strategies and academic proficiency. General satisfaction with physical health is above average (Z-score 0.55). Substance usage is generally low, with recreational and non-prescribed drugs not used at all. Exercise engagement is above average, indicating a commitment to physical activity. However, a distinctive pattern emerges in daily recreational habits: the participant reports little to no engagement in passive leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, listening to music, reading, or sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends is also reported as below average. This suggests a highly structured and perhaps less varied daily routine, potentially prioritizing productive activities over unstructured leisure. The participant also reports slightly below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and trust (Z-score -0.46), which presents a minor contrast to the otherwise strong psychological indicators.

**Sleep Quality and Habits**
The participant exhibits a mixed picture regarding sleep. Objectively, wearable data indicates notably favorable sleep patterns: a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 14 minutes (Z-Score 1.31) is significantly longer than the population average, and both sleep duration standard deviation (Z-Score -1.15) and sleep start time standard deviation (Z-Score -0.61) are well below average. This points to highly consistent and sufficient sleep quantity. However, subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep, with a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-Score 0.59), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This discrepancy suggests that while objective sleep metrics are positive, the subjective experience of sleep quality is compromised. Mean daily napping behavior is average.

**Physiological Arousal and Circadian Rhythms**
Physiological data reveals both strengths and potential areas of dysregulation. The participant's resting heart rate (RHR) is 54.1 bpm (Z-Score -0.48), and their Mesor (mean heart rate) is 69.72 (Z-Score -0.58), both of which are below the population average. This suggests a relatively healthy cardiovascular baseline. Circadian rhythmicity, as measured by Interdaily Stability (IS), is above average (Z-Score 0.67), indicating consistent daily activity patterns. Amplitude, reflecting the range of heart rate variation, is also above average (Z-Score 0.44), suggesting a robust physiological response capacity. However, Intradaily Variability (IV) is significantly elevated at 0.68 (Z-Score 0.95), suggesting a more fragmented or irregular heart rate pattern throughout the day, which can be indicative of physiological stress or disturbed activity/rest cycles. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals several periods of pronounced physiological arousal. Notably, heart rate is significantly elevated above the mesor during 12-1 PM (Z-Score 2.59) and 1-2 PM (Z-Score 2.11), suggesting intense midday activity or stress. A particularly striking elevation occurs from 10-11 PM (Z-Score 3.14), followed by another significant peak from 12-1 AM (Z-Score 1.47). These late-night and early-morning elevations are notable as they occur during times typically associated with winding down or sleep onset, potentially contributing to the subjectively reported sleep disturbance and the elevated Intradaily Variability.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress level comes from the participant's robust psychological profile. Their scores on the CESD (Z-score -0.97) and STAI (Z-score -1.31) are significantly below the population average, indicating minimal depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Given that both CESD and STAI scores show positive correlations with PSS, these substantially low scores strongly suggest a lower-than-average perceived stress level. Furthermore, the participant exhibits exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score 1.66), which is negatively correlated with PSS and serves as a significant psychological buffer against stress perception. Excellent academic performance (high GPA) and above-average engagement in exercise are also indicative of effective functioning and potentially good coping resources. Physiologically, a below-average resting heart rate and mesor, combined with highly consistent and long objective sleep duration, support a state generally less associated with chronic, high perceived stress. The Interdaily Stability score (Z-score 0.67) suggests a regular daily routine, which can contribute to a sense of control and lower perceived stress.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Countervailing evidence points to specific areas of potential stress or physiological dysregulation. The participant's subjective report of ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (Z-score 0.59) is above the population average and is positively correlated with PSS, indicating a perception of sleep difficulties. Physiologically, the significantly elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.95), which is positively correlated with PSS, suggests fragmented activity-rest cycles or physiological instability. Most notably, the aggregate hourly heart rate deviations reveal several pronounced peaks of arousal throughout the day, particularly during midday (12-1 PM, 1-2 PM) and late evening into early morning (10-11 PM, 12-1 AM). The 10-11 PM peak (Z-score 3.14) is particularly extreme and occurs when most individuals are winding down, potentially disrupting sleep initiation and contributing to subjective sleep disturbance and overall perceived physiological strain. The participant's very low engagement in general recreational activities might also suggest a lack of varied outlets for stress reduction, potentially making them more vulnerable to accumulating stress, despite their positive psychological traits.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits clear signs of physiological arousal during specific times of the day and reports subjective sleep disturbance, the overwhelming strength of their psychological protective factors—particularly very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, coupled with exceptionally high self-esteem—are critical in evaluating perceived stress. PSS measures the *subjective appraisal* of stress. Individuals with high self-esteem and low anxiety are typically less prone to perceiving daily demands as overwhelming or uncontrollable, even in the face of physiological activation. The positive correlations of CESD and STAI with PSS mean that the participant's very low scores on these measures are strong predictors of a lower PSS score. While the PSQI and high Intradaily Variability point towards elevated stress, their Z-scores are less extreme than those for CESD, STAI, and SelfEsteem. The physiological arousal peaks, while significant, might represent acute responses to specific events or intense activity rather than a chronically elevated perceived stress state. Considering the robust psychological resilience and strong objective sleep consistency, it is most probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

36385,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"This participant presents a complex psychological and physiological profile characterized by notable patterns across self-reported measures, sleep, and cardiovascular activity, which collectively point to significant perceived stress.

**Psychological State and Behavioral Habits**
The participant reports a substantial burden of depressive symptoms (CESD score 29.0, Z-score 1.63) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 49.0, Z-score 0.76), both of which are classified at levels indicating distress and positively correlate with perceived stress. This is further supported by lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) and reduced satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7). Paradoxically, the participant also reports higher-than-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and trust (Z-score 0.83), suggesting potential resilience or a coping mechanism that allows for some positive subjective experiences amidst other challenges. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent and improving performance, culminating in a 4.0 GPA, which could be a source of personal accomplishment but potentially also a driver of perfectionism or pressure. In terms of lifestyle, while engaging in health-promoting activities such as frequent sports (Z-score 0.91) and listening to music for extended periods (Z-score 1.13), there is also higher-than-average consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94), which may serve as a coping mechanism for stress or contribute to other health challenges. The participant also reports higher time spent watching TV/videos (Z-score 0.64), but avoids reading and sedentary hobbies, suggesting specific preferences in leisure activities.

**Sleep Patterns and Quality**
Objective Fitbit data reveals that the participant achieves a significantly longer median sleep duration (8 hours 47 minutes, Z-score 2.0) compared to the study population. However, this extended sleep is accompanied by substantial variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 133 minutes, Z-score 0.73) and sleep start times (standard deviation 140 minutes, Z-score 1.26). Such high irregularity in sleep timing is generally associated with poorer sleep quality and can be indicative of, or contribute to, stress. Consistent with this, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates subjectively ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite the objectively long sleep duration. The combination of objectively long but highly variable sleep, coupled with subjective reports of disturbed sleep, suggests that the sleep obtained may not be fully restorative or consistently align with the participant's natural sleep-wake cycle.

**Cardiovascular Activity and Circadian Rhythms**
The participant exhibits an overall elevated cardiovascular profile, evidenced by a higher-than-average Mesor (average heart rate, Z-score 0.41) and resting heart rate (Z-score 0.7). These elevated heart rate metrics are positively correlated with perceived stress. Analysis of circadian rhythms derived from heart rate data indicates a generally stable 24-hour rhythm, as suggested by slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.25) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.22), with an average amplitude. However, there is also slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.1), which could suggest less smooth physiological regulation throughout the day. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal a pronounced pattern of sustained physiological arousal well into the evening hours. Specifically, heart rate deviations are significantly elevated and peak between 7-8 PM (Z-score 0.94), 9-10 PM (Z-score 0.82), and 10-11 PM (Z-score 0.75). This prolonged period of elevated cardiovascular activity late in the day suggests difficulty in winding down physiologically, potentially contributing to a state of chronic arousal and hindering the transition to rest, aligning with the observed variability in sleep start times.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**
The evidence strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
*   **Mental Health Symptoms:** The participant reports significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 1.63, classified as ""Depressed"") and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.76, classified as ""anxious""). Both measures show positive correlations with PSS scores (0.28 and 0.31, respectively), indicating a direct relationship with higher perceived stress.
*   **Physiological Arousal:** Objective physiological data indicates a higher average heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.41) and elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.7), both of which are positively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, the sustained and pronounced elevation of hourly heart rate into the late evening (e.g., 7-8 PM, Z-score 0.94) points to chronic physiological arousal and difficulty unwinding.
*   **Sleep Dysregulation:** Despite objectively long sleep duration, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via PSQI and exhibits significantly high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.73) and sleep start times (Z-score 1.26). These high variability measures are positively correlated with PSS (0.14 and 0.17, respectively), suggesting an irregular sleep-wake cycle that likely contributes to stress.
*   **Self-Perception and Coping:** Lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) and reduced health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7) are generally associated with higher stress. Elevated alcohol use (Z-score 0.94) could be interpreted as a coping mechanism for stress, potentially maladaptive.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
*   **Positive Affect and Social Trust:** Higher self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.19) and trust (Z-score 0.83) could act as buffers against stress.
*   **Healthy Behaviors:** Active engagement in sports (Z-score 0.91, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.13) and extensive listening to music (Z-score 1.13) are positive coping strategies.
*   **Academic Success:** The improving and high GPA suggests academic competence or resilience.
*   **Circadian Regularity:** Slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.25, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.12) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.22, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.17) suggest some underlying regularity in the circadian system.
*   **Objectively Long Sleep:** The significantly longer median sleep duration (Z-score 2.0, negatively correlated with PSS at -0.05) would typically be associated with lower stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits several potentially protective factors such as positive affect, social trust, consistent academic achievement, and engagement in stress-reducing activities like sports and music, these do not appear sufficient to offset the significant indicators of elevated stress. The high scores on validated mental health instruments (CESD and STAI), which are directly linked to perceived stress, alongside pronounced physiological markers of chronic arousal (elevated resting heart rate, higher Mesor, and sustained evening HR elevation), point to a substantial underlying stress burden. The discrepancy between objectively long sleep and subjectively disturbed, highly variable sleep further indicates a dysregulated state that is commonly associated with elevated stress. The cumulative weight of these factors, particularly the mental health and physiological arousal data, strongly suggests that this participant experiences a level of perceived stress that is above average for the study population.

54030,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a highly favorable psychological profile characterized by minimal self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, robust self-esteem, and elevated levels of happiness. Specifically, the participant's CESD score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.07) indicates a low burden of depressive symptoms, while a STAI score of 27.0 (Z-score -1.41) reflects minimal trait anxiety, both of which correlate positively with perceived stress (0.29 and 0.32, respectively), thereby suggesting a low PSS score. Complementing this, a high self-esteem score of 49.0 (Z-score 1.52) and a high happiness score of 5.0 (Z-score 1.64) are present, correlating negatively with perceived stress (-0.16 and -0.19, respectively). These strong psychological buffers are further supported by an above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.72) and high trust in others (Z-score 1.47). Lifestyle choices also align with a low-stress profile, including no substance usage (Z-scores from -0.11 to -1.3), regular engagement in social exercise and sports (Z-scores 0.53 and 0.91), and good academic performance with a Fall 2016 GPA of 3.53. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), is classified as good and correlates negatively with PSS (-0.2), further supporting a potentially lower perceived stress level.

In contrast to the robust self-reported psychological well-being, objective wearable data reveals patterns indicative of physiological dysregulation, particularly concerning circadian rhythmicity and sleep. The participant's circadian rhythm shows signs of disruption, including below-average interdaily stability (0.28, Z-score -1.07) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.18, Z-score -1.2), alongside a low amplitude (6.78, Z-score -1.29), all of which correlate negatively with PSS (-0.11, -0.17, -0.16 respectively), suggesting higher perceived stress. A markedly high intradaily variability (0.88, Z-score 2.36) is also observed, which correlates positively with PSS (0.16), further pointing towards elevated stress. Objective sleep metrics also suggest challenges: a median sleep duration of 6 hours 18 minutes (Z-score -1.09) is below average, high variability in sleep duration (143 minutes, Z-score 0.96) is noted, and there is a high frequency of daily naps (0.22, Z-score 1.75). These sleep characteristics correlate with higher perceived stress (0.04 for duration, 0.14 for duration variability, 0.13 for napping, and 0.17 for sleep start time variability), despite the participant's good self-reported sleep quality.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates varied patterns of physiological arousal. During the early morning hours (e.g., 3-7 AM), the participant exhibits significantly lower heart rates relative to their mesor, with notably larger negative deviations than the population average (e.g., -10.65 with Z-score 0.9 at 3-4 AM). These pronounced drops in heart rate below the mesor in the early morning surprisingly correlate positively with PSS (0.19-0.21), suggesting a link to higher perceived stress. Conversely, during much of the active daytime period (e.g., 12-8 PM), the participant's heart rate elevations above the mesor are often less pronounced than the population average (indicated by negative Z-scores for positive deviations). This pattern, correlating negatively with PSS (-0.09 to -0.18), implies a comparatively blunted physiological arousal during the day, which is associated with lower perceived stress. In the late evening (10-11 PM), the participant shows a significantly elevated heart rate above the mesor (14.19, Z-score 1.22) that is more pronounced than average, and this specific elevation correlates negatively with PSS (-0.16), an intriguing finding that could imply a distinct physiological recovery or activity pattern associated with reduced perceived stress. The resting heart rate itself (58.4, Z-score 0.03) is average, with a weak positive correlation to PSS (0.14).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The available evidence presents a nuanced picture regarding the participant’s perceived stress level. There is substantial evidence pointing towards a relatively low or average PSS score. The participant's self-reported psychological well-being is exceptionally strong, characterized by significantly low levels of depression and anxiety, coupled with very high self-esteem and happiness. These psychological constructs are foundational to an individual's perception and coping with stress, and their scores show considerable deviations towards positive mental health (e.g., STAI Z-score -1.41, Happy Z-score 1.64). Furthermore, these self-report measures exhibit the strongest correlations with PSS in the dataset, consistently indicating that such a psychological profile is associated with lower perceived stress. Good self-reported sleep quality, healthy social engagement, and an absence of substance use further bolster the case for effective stress management.

Conversely, significant evidence suggests a potential for elevated perceived stress, predominantly from objective physiological and behavioral metrics. The wearable data points to notable dysregulation in circadian rhythms and objective sleep patterns, including high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability and amplitude, shorter sleep duration, and high sleep duration variability, alongside frequent napping. These objective markers are consistently associated with higher PSS. The hourly heart rate data also presents conflicting signals, with early morning pronounced HR drops correlating with higher PSS, though daytime patterns of less elevated HR align with lower PSS.

However, when evaluating *perceived* stress, the subjective experience as reported through direct psychological measures holds considerable weight. The overwhelming strength and consistency of the self-report data for low depression, low anxiety, high happiness, and high self-esteem—all highly relevant to how an individual perceives and processes stressors—suggest that the participant experiences relatively low levels of perceived stress despite physiological indicators of potential strain or dysregulation. The robust psychological buffers likely contribute to a subjective experience of lower stress. Therefore, considering the direct nature and strong correlation of these subjective reports with perceived stress, it is more probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

34062,26.0,0.927461139896373,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally resilient psychological profile, characterized by low self-reported depressive and anxious symptomatology. Their CES-D score of 7.0 and STAI score of 36.0, corresponding to Z-scores of -0.66 and -0.52 respectively, classify them as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious"" relative to the study population. This is further supported by a notably high self-esteem score of 48.0 (Z-score 1.38) and a high self-reported happiness score of 5.0 (Z-score 1.64), both of which are associated with lower perceived stress. Academic performance is consistently strong, with GPAs ranging from 3.4 to 3.75 across semesters, suggesting effective management of academic demands. Satisfaction with physical health is also high, indicated by a score of 6.67 (Z-score 1.8).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates an active and engaged lifestyle. They engage in exercise frequently, both alone and with others (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.23 respectively for ""Three times a week or more""). Socializing with friends for 1-2 hours daily is at an average to slightly above-average level (Z-score 0.16). Conversely, engagement in sedentary recreational activities such as video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies is notably low (Z-scores ranging from -0.56 to -0.96). Substance use is moderate, with beer and wine/liquor consumption reported 1-2 times a week, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. This overall behavioral pattern suggests active coping mechanisms and healthy lifestyle choices that are generally associated with reduced stress.

The primary area of concern lies within the participant's sleep patterns. Despite reporting an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score -0.11), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep."" This suggests that while sleep quantity may be adequate, subjective sleep quality is significantly impaired relative to the population. Fitbit data further reveals slightly elevated variability in sleep start time (Z-score 0.26) and more frequent napping (Z-score 0.82), which may contribute to or compensate for the perceived poor nighttime sleep. This discrepancy between objective duration and subjective quality, coupled with some irregularity in sleep timing, presents a potential significant source of perceived stress.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits robust cardiovascular health. Their resting heart rate is exceptionally low at 45.7 bpm (Z-score -1.48), and the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is also very low at 58.67 bpm (Z-score -2.08). These metrics are strong indicators of high cardiovascular fitness and a low baseline level of physiological arousal. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a clear and robust diurnal pattern. Heart rate is significantly below Mesor during nighttime hours, consistent with restful sleep, reaching its lowest point around 4-5 AM. A sharp increase in heart rate is observed in the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z-score 2.38), followed by active periods throughout the day with peaks in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, Z-score 2.02). This pattern indicates appropriate physiological responsiveness to daily demands and a healthy recovery period, rather than chronic hyperarousal. Circadian rhythm metrics show slight deviations from the population mean, with marginally lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.41) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.87), and slightly higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.17). While these suggest minor irregularities in daily physiological rhythms, they are not extreme and appear to be largely overridden by the overall markers of strong cardiovascular health.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant demonstrates a strong psychological profile highly indicative of lower perceived stress. Their self-reported scores for depressive symptoms (CES-D: Z-score -0.66) and anxiety (STAI: Z-score -0.52) are well below the population mean, classifying them as ""Not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Critically, they report exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score 1.38) and happiness (Z-score 1.64), both of which have negative correlations with PSS, meaning higher scores are associated with lower stress. Furthermore, their lifestyle includes frequent physical exercise (Z-scores > 1.0 for exercising alone and with others) and regular social interaction, both established buffers against stress. Physiologically, the participant displays remarkable cardiovascular fitness, evidenced by an unusually low resting heart rate (45.7 bpm, Z-score -1.48) and a very low Mesor (58.67 bpm, Z-score -2.08). These physiological markers suggest a strong capacity for stress regulation and a low baseline state of physiological arousal, which would typically translate to lower perceived stress. The clear and healthy diurnal pattern in heart rate further supports effective physiological regulation.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The primary indicator for potentially elevated perceived stress is the participant's self-reported sleep quality. A PSQI score of 10.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.52, indicates ""Disturbed Sleep."" Subjective sleep disturbance is a well-known and significant contributor to perceived stress. While objective sleep duration is average, the slightly elevated standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score 0.26) and above-average napping frequency (Z-score 0.82) suggest some underlying irregularity or compensatory behaviors related to sleep, which could contribute to overall stress. Minor irregularities in circadian rhythm, such as slightly lower interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, along with slightly higher intradaily variability, also weakly correlate with increased PSS, suggesting potential physiological disruptions that could marginally contribute to stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant's disturbed sleep quality is a significant concern and a known stressor, the cumulative weight of other protective factors strongly suggests that their overall perceived stress level is likely in the bottom half of the study population. The very low self-reported depression and anxiety, combined with exceptionally high self-esteem and happiness, are direct measures of subjective well-being that are fundamentally linked to how an individual perceives and copes with stress. These psychological buffers are robust. Furthermore, the outstanding physiological health, particularly the very low resting heart rate and Mesor, indicate a high degree of physical resilience that would likely mitigate the impact of sleep disturbance on the overall perception of stress. The active and social lifestyle further supports a robust coping strategy. Despite the sleep issues, the participant appears to manage overall life demands with a psychological and physiological fortitude that would likely keep their PSS score below the population median.

18111,28.0,0.961139896373057,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a psychological and physiological profile marked by elevated self-reported distress, significant sleep disturbances, and dysregulated circadian rhythms, which collectively suggest an experience of heightened perceived stress.

Psychologically, the participant reports a substantial burden of depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CESD score of 27.0 (Z-score: 1.42), classifying them as 'Depressed', and high trait anxiety with a STAI score of 48.0 (Z-score: 0.66), classified as 'Anxious'. Both of these measures show positive correlations with perceived stress (CESD: 0.28, STAI: 0.31), indicating a direct relationship with higher PSS scores. Furthermore, subjective happiness is notably low (Current: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), correlating negatively with perceived stress (-0.19), reinforcing a general state of diminished well-being. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.31), which has a weak negative correlation with PSS, aligning with a potential association between lower self-worth and higher perceived stress. Health satisfaction is also somewhat below average (Z-score: -0.53).

Behaviorally and in terms of sleep, the participant reports disturbed sleep quality via the PSQI (Score: 8.0, Z-score: 0.59), indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance. Wearable data corroborates some sleep irregularities: while median sleep duration is average (7 hours 16 minutes), the standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly elevated (113 minutes, Z-score: 0.27), suggesting less consistent nightly sleep, a factor that positively correlates with perceived stress (0.14). A particularly salient finding is the significantly high frequency of daily naps (Value: 0.27, Z-score: 2.27), which also positively correlates with perceived stress (0.12). The median sleep start time is late (01:19:30 AM). In terms of daily habits, the participant reports elevated alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor usage 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores of 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), which may serve as a coping mechanism. There is also higher engagement in internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.85), which positively correlates with PSS (0.1), and a reported absence of reading, which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.21), suggesting that less engagement in reading is associated with higher stress.

Physiological data from wearable devices further supports a profile consistent with elevated stress. The participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythms demonstrate significant dysregulation: interdaily stability is markedly low (Value: 0.24, Z-score: -1.4), indicating irregular day-to-day patterns, and this metric negatively correlates with PSS (-0.11). Similarly, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly dampened (Value: 6.21, Z-score: -1.48), reflecting a less robust physiological rhythm, which also negatively correlates with PSS (-0.16). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average (Z-score: -0.95), further indicating poor day-to-day rhythm consistency. The intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.24), correlating positively with PSS (0.16), potentially reflecting more fragmented activity and rest cycles. Examination of the mean aggregate hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a critical pattern during typical nocturnal rest. Specifically, during the early morning hours (3-6 AM), the participant exhibits less pronounced decreases in heart rate (higher relative heart rate) compared to the study population, with notably high Z-scores for these periods (e.g., 4-5am Z=0.96, 5-6am Z=0.82 for negative deviations from mesor). The positive correlations for these specific hourly periods with PSS (e.g., 0.18 for 3-4am, 0.19 for 4-5am, 0.21 for 5-6am) suggest that a relatively higher heart rate during typical rest is associated with higher perceived stress, indicating potential physiological arousal or reduced restorative capacity during sleep. While evening heart rate peaks are pronounced (e.g., 8-9 PM Z-score: 1.85), their negative correlations with PSS suggest they might represent periods of active engagement rather than stress-induced arousal, or that their interpretation in this context is complex and potentially moderated by other factors.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on the multimodal data analysis, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the **top half** of the study population distribution with regards to their PSS score.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence stems from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly elevated symptoms of depression (CESD Z-score: 1.42, 'Depressed' classification) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.66, 'Anxious' classification), both of which have positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31, respectively). Furthermore, self-reported happiness is notably low (Z-score: -1.61) and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI score of 8.0, 'Disturbed Sleep').

Physiologically, the circadian rhythm metrics point to a highly dysregulated system, characterized by significantly low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.4, correlation with PSS: -0.11) and a dampened amplitude (Z-score: -1.48, correlation with PSS: -0.16). These markers consistently indicate less robust and irregular physiological rhythms, which are associated with higher perceived stress. The hourly heart rate data is particularly indicative during nocturnal hours, showing relatively less heart rate deceleration (i.e., higher HR compared to the population mean deviation) during the typical deepest sleep period (3-6 AM), with these less pronounced drops correlating positively with PSS (e.g., 0.21 for 5-6 AM). This suggests physiological arousal that hinders restorative sleep. Behavioral patterns such as high napping frequency (Z-score: 2.27, correlation with PSS: 0.12), higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 0.27, correlation with PSS: 0.14), high internet usage (Z-score: 0.85, correlation with PSS: 0.1), and absence of reading (correlation with PSS: -0.21) further align with a profile of elevated stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
There are very few indicators that suggest a low or median PSS score. The participant has an average resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.01) and average median sleep duration. The standard deviation of sleep *start time* is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.31). However, its positive correlation with PSS (0.18) means that *lower* variability actually points to *lower* PSS, which is a counter-indicative point. Also, pronounced evening heart rate peaks (e.g., 8-9 PM Z-score: 1.85) show a negative correlation with PSS (-0.11), suggesting that these specific peaks might align with lower PSS, potentially indicating active engagement rather than stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The overwhelming majority of salient findings, across self-report, physiological, and behavioral domains, consistently point towards a participant experiencing significant psychological distress and physiological dysregulation. The strong positive correlations of depression and anxiety with PSS, combined with objective markers of circadian disruption, impaired nocturnal recovery (elevated HR during sleep), and maladaptive coping behaviors (excessive napping, high internet usage, less reading), far outweigh the few conflicting or neutral data points. Therefore, the composite evidence strongly supports the conclusion that this participant's perceived stress level is elevated relative to the study population.

59097,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates several areas of potential concern related to perceived stress. The CES-D score of 28.0 (Z-score: 1.53) places the participant well above the study population mean for depressive symptoms, with this score correlating positively with perceived stress (0.29). Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 47.0 (Z-score: 0.56) suggests elevated chronic anxiety, which also demonstrates a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31). This psychological profile points towards an increased likelihood of experiencing higher stress levels. Self-esteem, with a score of 36.0 (Z-score: -0.31), is slightly below the population average, and its negative correlation with PSS (-0.15) suggests a modest association between lower self-esteem and elevated perceived stress. Self-reported happiness, scored at 2.0 (Z-score: -1.61), is notably lower than the population average and correlates negatively with perceived stress (-0.19), reinforcing a potential link between reduced happiness and higher stress. Health satisfaction is near the population mean (Z-score: 0.05), and trust in others is somewhat lower than average (Z-score: -0.78), though these have negligible correlations with PSS.

Sleep quality and duration metrics present a complex picture. The PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59) classifies the participant as experiencing disturbed sleep, indicating subjective difficulties despite objectively adequate sleep duration. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 23 minutes (Z-score: 1.5), which is considerably longer than the population average. This longer duration shows a negligible negative correlation with PSS (-0.04), suggesting it may not be a primary mitigating factor for stress, or could reflect increased sleep need in response to underlying distress. Both sleep duration standard deviation (74 minutes, Z-score: -0.62) and sleep start time standard deviation (38 minutes, Z-score: -0.99) are lower than the population mean, indicating relatively consistent sleep duration and bedtimes. The consistency in sleep timing and duration, correlating positively with PSS (0.14 and 0.17 respectively), suggests that greater sleep regularity is associated with lower perceived stress in this population. The participant's median sleep start time is 01:07:45, indicating a later sleep onset, and they report no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86), which also correlates positively with PSS (0.14), implying an absence of napping is associated with lower stress.

Analysis of heart rate data reveals a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm. The resting heart rate of 58.55 BPM (Z-score: 0.05) is average. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate high interdaily stability (0.57, Z-score: 1.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, Z-score: 1.23), alongside low intradaily variability (0.33, Z-score: -1.52). These metrics suggest a highly structured daily heart rate pattern. Such regularity is generally associated with lower PSS, as indicated by negative correlations for interdaily stability (-0.11) and autocorrelation (-0.17), and a positive correlation for intradaily variability (0.16) where lower variability links to lower stress. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is 79.63 BPM (Z-score: 0.78), slightly above average, while the Amplitude of 14.74 (Z-score: 1.28) is notably high, reflecting a pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates, and correlating negatively with PSS (-0.16). The Acrophase, indicating the peak of heart rate activity, occurs at 4:49 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with values significantly below the Mesor during early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, value -22.17, Z-score: -1.34, approximately 57 BPM relative to a 79.63 BPM Mesor), consistent with a sleep state near the resting heart rate of 58.55 BPM. Heart rate is elevated above the Mesor during daytime, peaking around noon to early afternoon (e.g., 11 AM - 12 PM, value 13.96, Z-score: 1.25, approximately 93.6 BPM). The pattern of lower heart rates during sleep and elevated heart rates during the day is consistent with typical physiological activity, with the high amplitude reflecting a pronounced diurnal variation. Notably, lower heart rate values during early morning hours, representing physiological troughs, show a positive correlation with PSS (e.g., 3-4 AM correlation: 0.19). This might indicate that more pronounced physiological deceleration during these periods is paradoxically associated with higher perceived stress in this population, potentially reflecting a deeper physiological recovery demand or a stress-related autonomic profile, rather than solely indicating reduced stress.

The participant's behavioral patterns present a diverse profile, with academic performance consistently strong as indicated by high GPAs (e.g., 3.69, 3.6). Substance use includes ""1-2 times a week"" for both beer (Z-score: 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score: 0.94), placing these habits above the population average, though correlations with PSS are negligible. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""not at all."" Exercise frequency for ""exercised alone"" (Z-score: -0.43) and ""exercised with others"" (Z-score: -0.17) is below average. However, participation in ""sports"" (Z-score: 0.91) is above average, occurring ""1-2 times a week,"" and this activity correlates negatively with PSS (-0.13), suggesting a potentially stress-buffering role. Recreational habits include above-average time spent socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95), which shows a weak positive correlation with PSS (0.06). Reading for 15 minutes or less (Z-score: 0.32) is slightly above average and correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21), suggesting it might be a stress-reducing activity. Internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-score: 0.18) is average and correlates positively with PSS (0.11). Other leisure activities like watching TV/videos/movies and sedentary hobbies are around average. The combination of elevated depressive symptoms and lower happiness, despite relatively high academic achievement and some positive social and exercise habits, indicates a complex interplay of factors influencing perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50%)**:
The participant exhibits several characteristics associated with lower perceived stress. Physiologically, there is strong evidence for highly stable and regular circadian rhythms in heart rate, including high interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.33, correlation: -0.11), low intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.52, correlation: 0.16, indicating lower stress with lower variability), and high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: 1.23, correlation: -0.17). A pronounced circadian amplitude (Z-score: 1.28, correlation: -0.16) also aligns with lower stress. Furthermore, consistency in sleep patterns, evidenced by lower standard deviations in both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.62, correlation: 0.14, meaning less variability is associated with lower stress) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.99, correlation: 0.17, meaning less variability is associated with lower stress), is another factor linked to lower perceived stress. Behaviorally, engaging in sports (Z-score: 0.91, correlation: -0.13) and reading (Z-score: 0.32, correlation: -0.21) are habits that correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting they may act as protective or mitigating factors against stress. The participant's resting heart rate is average (Z-score: 0.05), which does not strongly indicate elevated physiological stress.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%)**:
Conversely, substantial evidence points towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The most prominent indicators are the self-reported psychological measures. The CES-D score of 28.0 (Z-score: 1.53) places the participant significantly above the mean for depressive symptoms and has a notable positive correlation with PSS (0.29). Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 47.0 (Z-score: 0.56) indicates elevated trait anxiety, which also strongly correlates with PSS (0.31). A remarkably low self-reported happiness score of 2.0 (Z-score: -1.61) shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.19), implying that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is disturbed (Score: 8.0, Z-score: 0.59). While objective sleep duration is long, its correlation with PSS is negligible, suggesting it doesn't effectively mitigate perceived stress. Internet usage (Z-score: 0.18, correlation: 0.11) and above-average socializing (Z-score: 0.95, correlation: 0.06) show weak positive correlations with PSS, suggesting these activities are not strongly stress-reducing and might even be mildly associated with higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis**:
The participant presents a mixed profile, characterized by strong physiological regularity and consistency in sleep patterns, which are typically associated with lower perceived stress. These protective factors are significant. However, the magnitude and direct relevance of the self-reported psychological distress markers are particularly compelling. The participant exhibits substantially elevated depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, and markedly lower happiness, all of which are robustly and directly correlated with higher PSS in the study population. The Z-scores for CES-D (1.53) and happiness (-1.61) are quite extreme, indicating significant deviations from the population mean in directions consistent with higher stress. While the body maintains a robust circadian rhythm, this physiological stability does not appear to fully buffer the subjective experience of distress and unhappiness. The presence of disturbed subjective sleep quality further compounds the evidence for elevated stress. Therefore, despite the presence of some physiological and behavioral characteristics associated with lower stress, the overall weight of evidence, particularly from the self-reported psychological instruments, strongly suggests that the participant experiences an elevated level of perceived stress compared to their peers.

**Psychological Well-being and Self-Perception:**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile generally indicates adaptive functioning across several key domains. Scores on the CES-D scale (10.0, Z-score -0.34) and STAI-Trait scale (33.0, Z-score -0.82) are both below the study population mean, classifying the individual as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. Concurrently, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (44.0, Z-score 0.82) and high satisfaction with their physical health (5.33, Z-score 0.8). Academic performance, as indicated by consistently strong GPAs (e.g., 3.41 in Spring 2016), further supports a profile of capability and achievement. However, this positive self-perception is somewhat contrasted by a self-reported happiness score (3.0, Z-score -0.53) that is below the population average. Trust in others is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.14), though its correlation with perceived stress is negligible.

**Sleep Quality and Chronotype:**
Despite the relatively positive psychological self-reports, the participant exhibits significant markers of sleep disturbance. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating subjective difficulties with sleep quality and related issues. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 55 minutes (Z-score -0.32), which is slightly below the population average. A particularly salient finding is the very late median sleep start time of 02:10:14, strongly suggesting a delayed sleep phase or a 'night owl' chronotype. While variability in sleep duration (98 minutes, Z-score -0.07) and sleep start time (85 minutes, Z-score 0.05) are close to the population mean, the extremely late sleep onset, especially if daily commitments require early waking, likely contributes significantly to the reported sleep disturbance. The participant also reports no daily naps, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.86).

**Physiological Regulation and Circadian Rhythmicity:**
The wearable physiological data highlights profound irregularities in the participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythms, indicating significant physiological dysregulation. Measures of circadian stability are notably low: Interdaily Stability (0.17, Z-score -1.98) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.11, Z-score -1.79) are significantly below the population mean, demonstrating a highly irregular and unstructured day-to-day physiological rhythm. The Amplitude of daily heart rate fluctuation (5.9, Z-score -1.58) is also substantially reduced, suggesting a flattened physiological response curve throughout the day. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (0.61, Z-score 0.46) is above average, implying more fragmented activity/rest patterns within a single day. These metrics collectively point to a substantial lack of physiological rhythmicity. Furthermore, the participant's Resting Heart Rate (64.7 bpm, Z-score 0.78) and Mesor (average heart rate) (76.86 bpm, Z-score 0.4) are both elevated compared to the population, suggesting a higher baseline physiological arousal. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs late in the day at 5:40 PM, corroborating the observed delayed physiological activity and late sleep onset. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal sustained lower heart rates relative to their average during early morning hours (e.g., 7-8 AM, -12.55 deviation), followed by increases throughout the day, with a notable peak in physiological activity during the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, 14.06 deviation). There are also periods of relative physiological deactivation during the afternoon (e.g., 12-3 PM show heart rates significantly lower than the population mean for those hours, relative to their own mesor). This overall pattern suggests a delayed and somewhat fragmented daily physiological rhythm that deviates from typical patterns.

**Behavioral Habits and Lifestyle:**
In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in regular physical activity, reporting exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports 1-2 times a week. Z-scores indicate that participation in sports (0.91) and exercising with others (0.53) are higher than average, while exercising alone (0.32) is moderately above average. This consistent engagement in exercise is generally associated with better stress management. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores indicating higher than average usage (beer: 1.01; wine/liquor: 0.94), though correlations with PSS are negligible. Recreational drug use and non-prescribed drug use are reported as ""not at all."" Daily recreational habits include above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64) and listening to music (Z-score 0.67), while internet usage (Z-score -0.49) and video game playing (Z-score -0.56) are below average. Time spent socializing with friends (Z-score 0.16) is close to the population average. Reading, which can be a de-stressing activity, is reported at 15 minutes or less, though its correlation with PSS is negative, implying even this modest engagement might be beneficial.

---

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median Perceived Stress (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological characteristics offer several indicators that might suggest a lower or average perceived stress level. They report significantly lower-than-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.82, correlation with PSS: 0.31) and below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.34, correlation with PSS: 0.28). For both these measures, lower scores typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits high self-esteem (Z-score 0.82, correlation with PSS: -0.15) and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 0.8, correlation with PSS: -0.08), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting a protective effect against stress. Engagement in regular physical activity, including sports, is generally recognized as a positive coping mechanism for stress, with sports participation showing a slight negative correlation with PSS (-0.13). Modest engagement in reading also shows a small negative correlation with PSS (-0.21).

**Evidence for High Perceived Stress (Top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, a substantial body of evidence from physiological and sleep data strongly suggests an elevated level of perceived stress. The most compelling indicators are derived from the wearable-based circadian rhythm metrics, which are profoundly disrupted. The participant demonstrates extremely low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.98, correlation with PSS: -0.12) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score -1.79, correlation with PSS: -0.17), alongside a significantly reduced Amplitude (Z-score -1.58, correlation with PSS: -0.17). These metrics, which are all negatively correlated with PSS, indicate a highly irregular, flattened, and physiologically dysregulated daily rhythm, which is a strong physiological signature of chronic stress. This is further supported by above-average Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.46, correlation with PSS: 0.16), suggesting more fragmented activity patterns, which positively correlates with higher PSS. Physiologically, both the Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.78, correlation with PSS: 0.14) and the Mesor (Z-score 0.4, correlation with PSS: 0.06) are elevated, denoting higher baseline physiological arousal, and both are positively correlated with PSS. Self-reported sleep quality is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score 0.13, no PSS correlation provided), and the objective median sleep start time is very late (02:10:14), indicating a problematic sleep schedule known to contribute to sleep debt and stress. Finally, self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score -0.53), and happiness is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19), implying lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant's self-reported psychological health (low anxiety/depression, high self-esteem) presents a profile typically associated with lower perceived stress, the objective physiological and behavioral data paint a contrasting picture. The severe disruption in circadian rhythms, characterized by profoundly low interdaily stability, 24-hour autocorrelation, and amplitude, along with elevated resting heart rate and self-reported disturbed sleep, are powerful and consistent indicators of significant physiological stress and dysregulation. These physiological markers, in particular, often reflect underlying stress that may not be fully captured by subjective psychological questionnaires or may exist despite adaptive psychological coping strategies. The observed correlations further support that these physiological disruptions are linked to higher PSS. Given the profound and pervasive nature of the physiological dysregulation and sleep disturbances, which represent fundamental aspects of well-being, these factors are likely exerting a significant influence on the participant's overall perceived stress, outweighing the positive self-reported psychological traits. Therefore, despite some protective psychological traits, the overwhelming physiological evidence points towards elevated perceived stress.

84502,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex psychological profile characterized by a blend of protective factors and areas of elevated concern. While trait anxiety (STAI score 38.0, Z=-0.33) is below the population average, indicating relatively lower stable anxiety proneness, the participant reports slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score 18.0, Z=0.49), classified as ""Depressed."" These depressive symptoms positively correlate with perceived stress. On other well-being measures, the participant demonstrates above-average self-esteem (Z=0.4) and health satisfaction (Z=0.72), both of which typically correlate negatively with perceived stress. Trust in others is also above average (Z=0.83). However, self-reported happiness (Z=-0.53) is somewhat below the population average. This suggests a mixed internal landscape, where resilient psychological traits coexist with certain indices of emotional distress.

Lifestyle analysis reveals a pattern of healthy behaviors and active engagement. The participant reports no substance use across all surveyed categories (e.g., beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs), placing them well below the population average for these behaviors. Physical activity is notably high, particularly in exercising with others (Z=1.23), indicating social and physical engagement, which is generally associated with positive mental health outcomes. Recreation habits suggest limited engagement in passive, screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos (Z=-1.25) and video games (Z=-0.56). Internet usage is moderate, and while socializing with friends is slightly below average (Z=-0.62), reading is moderately engaged (Z=0.32). Overall, this lifestyle pattern appears conducive to general well-being, characterized by low substance use, high physical activity, and moderate engagement in enriching, non-sedentary leisure.

A notable discrepancy emerges in the participant's sleep profile when comparing objective wearable data with subjective self-report. Objectively, Fitbit data indicates a relatively robust sleep pattern: median sleep duration is above average at 7 hours 31 minutes (Z=0.41), and sleep start time exhibits below-average variability (standard deviation Z=-0.39), suggesting consistent bedtimes. These objective metrics of sleep quantity and regularity generally correlate with lower perceived stress. However, the participant reports severely disturbed subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a high Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z=1.52), which is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This significantly elevated PSQI score is strongly positively correlated with perceived stress, highlighting a substantial subjective burden related to sleep that contradicts the more favorable objective measures.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics indicate a robust and stable circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits above-average Interdaily Stability (Z=1.16) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z=0.81), signifying consistent day-to-day physiological patterns. Furthermore, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm displays a healthy amplitude (Z=0.53), reflecting a clear distinction between active and rest phases. These indicators of strong circadian rhythmicity generally correlate with lower perceived stress. The participant's resting heart rate (52.6 bpm, Z=-0.66) is also below the population average, typically indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced daily pattern: heart rates are significantly below the mesor during nocturnal hours, consistent with rest. During the day, there is a substantial increase, peaking notably in the late afternoon/early evening between 4-6 PM (e.g., 4-5 PM Z=2.54, 5-6 PM Z=2.07). This represents a particularly high level of physiological arousal compared to the study population, with the acrophase (peak time of heart rate activity) occurring at 4:08 PM, aligning with this observed physiological maximum. While the direct correlations for these specific hourly peaks with PSS are low, this pronounced late-afternoon arousal represents a significant physiological characteristic.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), is assessed by weighing the available evidence for both high and low stress. The population's 50th percentile PSS score is 22.0.

Evidence for a relatively low or average PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes several protective factors: the participant exhibits below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z=-0.33), above-average self-esteem (Z=0.4), and high health satisfaction (Z=0.72), all of which negatively correlate with PSS. Lifestyle factors such as very low substance use and high levels of physical activity, particularly exercising with others (Z=1.23), are also typically associated with lower stress. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates robust and stable heart rate-based circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z=1.16, Autocorrelation at 24 hours Z=0.81, Amplitude Z=0.53) and a below-average resting heart rate (Z=-0.66), all correlating negatively with perceived stress. Objectively, sleep duration is above average (Z=0.41) and consistent.

Conversely, strong evidence supports a relatively high PSS score (top 50th percentile). The most salient indicator is the participant's significantly elevated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0, which has a Z-score of 1.52 and is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This high PSQI score is very strongly positively correlated with perceived stress, indicating a profound subjective experience of poor sleep quality that likely contributes substantially to overall stress. Furthermore, the participant reports slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score 18.0, Z=0.49), a factor also positively correlated with perceived stress. While objectively the participant's sleep duration is good, the subjective perception of disturbed sleep, coupled with elevated depressive symptoms, represents a significant burden. The intense period of physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon (peaking at 4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.54) is also a notable deviation from population averages, although its direct correlation with PSS is not strong.

Holistically, despite numerous protective factors such as low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, robust circadian rhythms, and good objective sleep duration, the severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z=1.52) and slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.49) are powerful indicators of current psychological distress that likely manifest as higher perceived stress. The magnitude of the PSQI Z-score is particularly compelling, suggesting that the participant's personal experience of sleep quality is a dominant factor influencing their overall perceived stress level. Therefore, it is highly probable that these significant subjective experiences would place the participant's PSS score in the upper half of the study population distribution.

78783,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant sleep disturbance and physiological arousal extending into the evening, alongside average depressive symptoms but notably low self-reported happiness. Psychologically, while their self-reported depressive symptoms are within the average range (CESD Z-score -0.03), indicating a lack of significant depressive symptom burden, they report slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17). More strikingly, self-reported happiness is significantly below the population average (Z-score -1.61), and satisfaction with physical health is also notably low (Z-score -1.11). These indicators of general discontent and anxiety suggest a predisposition to higher perceived stress despite a moderately above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11) which typically offers some protective effect.

A central theme across both subjective and objective data is pronounced sleep disturbance. The participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), which is corroborated by wearable data. Objectively, median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours and 52 minutes (Z-score -0.39). Crucially, there is extreme inconsistency in sleep patterns, evidenced by a very high standard deviation in sleep duration (151 minutes, Z-score 1.13) and, most notably, in sleep start times (173 minutes, Z-score 1.99). The median sleep start time of nearly 3 AM further highlights a severely disrupted and delayed sleep schedule. The participant also reports a high frequency of daily naps (Z-score 2.23), potentially as a compensatory mechanism for insufficient or irregular nighttime sleep. This combination points to a profoundly dysregulated sleep-wake cycle, a significant contributor to perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from heart rate further reinforces patterns of arousal. While the participant exhibits a below-average resting heart rate (52.75 bpm, Z-score -0.64), indicating good cardiovascular fitness, and their heart rate drops significantly below the mesor during early morning hours (e.g., -23.04 deviation at 6-8 AM), suggesting adequate physiological recovery during deep sleep phases, a concerning pattern emerges in the evening. Aggregate hourly heart rate deviations show a substantial elevation late into the night, particularly from 7-8 PM (deviation 17.32, Z-score 1.01) and even more pronouncedly from 10-11 PM (deviation 16.47, Z-score 1.58). This sustained physiological arousal extending late into the night suggests difficulty in winding down and disengaging, which is a common physiological manifestation of stress or anxiety and is directly at odds with establishing a consistent, restorative sleep schedule. The circadian acrophase occurs at 6:24 PM, consistent with a peak in activity and arousal in the late afternoon/early evening.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent exercise, both alone (Z-score 1.07) and through sports (Z-score 0.91), which are generally beneficial for stress management. They also spend above-average time socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95) and playing video games (Z-score 1.71). Substance use is minimal. However, a lack of engagement in reading (Z-score -0.67), which has a moderate negative correlation with PSS, might indicate a missed opportunity for a potentially calming activity. Despite the presence of positive health behaviors like exercise and social engagement, the pervasive sleep disruption and sustained evening physiological arousal suggest that these positive factors may be insufficient to fully mitigate the overall impact of stressors on their well-being.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The evidence strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the **top half** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Several factors indicate an elevated perceived stress level. The participant reports significantly low happiness (Z-score -1.61) and below-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.11), both of which are common co-occurrences with higher stress. Subjectively, the PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) clearly indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, a well-established precursor and consequence of stress. Objectively, wearable data reveals profound sleep dysregulation, most notably indicated by extremely high variability in sleep start times (Z-score 1.99) and sleep duration (Z-score 1.13), alongside a very late median sleep start time. This fragmented and inconsistent sleep architecture is a strong indicator of compromised well-being and elevated stress. Physiologically, the participant exhibits prolonged evening physiological arousal, with heart rate deviations significantly above the mesor, particularly between 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.58), suggesting difficulty in achieving a state of relaxation necessary for winding down and effective sleep. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17) further contributes to a higher likelihood of experiencing and reporting stress. The moderate positive correlations of STAI and CESD scores with PSS, combined with the participant's slightly elevated STAI, align with this pattern. Furthermore, the lack of reading, which correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21), removes a potential stress-buffering activity.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, some indicators might suggest a lower or average stress level, though they are less potent than the evidence for high stress. The participant's depressive symptoms are within the average range (CESD Z-score -0.03), suggesting that clinical depression is not a primary driver of stress. They engage in frequent exercise (Exercised Alone Z-score 1.07, Sports Z-score 0.91), a known stress-reducing behavior, and maintain slightly above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), which can act as a psychological buffer. The below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.64) and effective lowering of heart rate during early morning hours suggest good underlying cardiovascular health and physiological recovery during sleep, at least for some periods. However, these positive factors are largely overshadowed by the pervasive sleep and arousal issues.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the totality of the data, the compelling evidence of severe sleep disturbance, characterized by extreme irregularity and late onset, coupled with subjective reports of low happiness and health satisfaction, and objective physiological indicators of sustained evening arousal, strongly points to an elevated level of perceived stress. While positive coping mechanisms like exercise are present, they do not appear sufficient to mitigate the impact of disrupted sleep and chronic arousal. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score exceeds the median of the study population.

25197,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a complex profile, demonstrating areas of notable psychological resilience and robust physiological regulation alongside indications of elevated trait anxiety and sleep disturbance. On self-report measures, the participant scored within the non-depressed range on the CES-D scale (Score 10.0, Z-score -0.34), indicating a lower burden of depressive symptoms compared to the study population. This is further supported by a significantly high self-esteem score (Score 44.0, Z-score 0.82) and very high satisfaction with physical health (Score 6.44, Z-score 1.63), both of which are favorably correlated with lower perceived stress. However, the participant's STAI-Trait score (Score 50.0, Z-score 0.86) is classified as 'anxious' and stands notably above the population average, suggesting a predisposition to chronic anxiety which typically correlates positively with perceived stress. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently high GPAs (e.g., 4.0 in 2016 Fall), suggests strong academic coping, though this could also be a source of pressure. Lifestyle behaviors generally appear healthy, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs and engaging in reading above the population average, which correlates negatively with perceived stress. While alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor) is reported at 1-2 times a week with Z-scores around 1.0, this is only moderately above the population mean.

Sleep quality and duration present a mixed picture. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep as per the PSQI (Score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance, though the Z-score is close to the population mean. Objective Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score -0.77), which is below the population average. However, the participant demonstrates remarkably consistent sleep patterns, with below-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (61 minutes, Z-score -0.91) and sleep start time (56 minutes, Z-score -0.58). This consistency in sleep timing, despite shorter duration and subjective disturbance, suggests a relatively stable sleep routine. The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86) further supports this pattern of less fragmented sleep behavior during the day.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a strong and well-regulated cardiovascular profile, albeit with specific periods of heightened arousal. The participant's resting heart rate is low (52.4 bpm, Z-score -0.68), significantly below the population mean, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data shows a lower-than-average MESOR (67.71 bpm, Z-score -0.85) but a robust Amplitude (12.77, Z-score 0.64), suggesting a healthy and distinct diurnal rhythm of heart rate, with pronounced peaks and troughs relative to their low baseline. This higher amplitude correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting better physiological adaptability. The Intradaily Variability (0.47, Z-score -0.53) is also below average, implying more stable and less fragmented heart rate patterns within the day, which correlates positively with PSS, meaning lower IV is associated with lower PSS. The Acrophase at 4:02 PM indicates the typical timing of peak heart rate activity. An examination of hourly heart rate deviation from the MESOR highlights a period of exceptionally high physiological arousal between 3-4 PM, with a deviation of 38.33 bpm and an extreme Z-score of 5.3. While other afternoon hours also show elevated activity, this specific peak is significantly pronounced. This suggests that while the participant maintains a healthy physiological baseline and rhythm, there is a pronounced and atypical surge in cardiovascular activity during a specific window in the late afternoon, which aligns with their acrophase.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The available evidence provides both indicators for higher and lower perceived stress, necessitating a holistic assessment.

**Evidence for a lower or average PSS score (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators of resilience and well-being. Their CES-D score is below the population mean, indicating low depressive symptoms, which typically correlates with lower PSS. High self-esteem and exceptional health satisfaction (both significantly above population averages and negatively correlated with PSS) are powerful protective factors against perceived stress. Physiologically, a notably low resting heart rate and a robust circadian amplitude suggest a healthy and adaptable cardiovascular system. Furthermore, the participant's heart rate variability (low Intradaily Variability) and consistent sleep patterns (low standard deviation for duration and start time) are generally associated with better physiological regulation, which correlates with lower PSS. Engagement in healthy coping mechanisms, such as above-average reading and avoidance of illicit substance use, also aligns with lower stress profiles.

**Evidence for a higher PSS score (top 50%):**
Conversely, the participant's self-reported trait anxiety (STAI-Trait Z-score 0.86, classified as 'anxious') is a significant indicator of elevated chronic stress proneness, which strongly correlates with higher PSS. Subjective reports of 'Disturbed Sleep' via the PSQI, even with a Z-score near the mean, point to an area of concern that often accompanies higher stress. Objectively, a shorter median sleep duration (Z-score -0.77) compared to the population average could be a consequence or contributor to increased stress. Most notably, the participant experiences an extreme surge in hourly heart rate deviation from the MESOR (Z-score 5.3) between 3-4 PM. While the overall physiological profile is healthy, such an intense and localized physiological arousal peak, even if typical for this individual (aligned with acrophase), could represent a significant daily experience of physiological stress or demanding activity.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety and disturbed sleep, a substantial body of evidence points towards resilience, effective physiological regulation, and healthy behaviors that would mitigate overall perceived stress. The low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high health satisfaction are strong psychological buffers. Physiologically, the low resting heart rate, robust circadian amplitude, and consistent sleep schedule reflect a well-functioning system at baseline. Even the extreme afternoon heart rate peak, while indicative of intense arousal, occurs within a context of otherwise healthy and stable physiological parameters. The overall pattern suggests that while the participant may experience bouts of anxiety and some sleep challenges, their foundational psychological and physiological resources are likely sufficient to keep their overall perceived stress in check, particularly when viewed in the context of academic demands and lifestyle choices. The sheer number of positively correlated metrics (e.g., RHR, IV, sleep variability) that also show *favorable* scores (low Z-scores) strengthens the argument for lower PSS. Therefore, it is more likely that the participant's PSS score falls into the lower half of the study population distribution.

23270,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile reveals a complex interplay of traits and behaviors. Self-report data indicates an elevated level of trait anxiety, with a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 47.0 (Z-score 0.56), classifying the individual as ""anxious."" This measure exhibits a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31), suggesting a predisposition to experience higher levels of stress. In contrast, depressive symptoms, as assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), are below average (score 11.0, Z-score -0.24), classifying the participant as ""not depressed,"" which typically correlates with lower perceived stress. Self-esteem (Z-score -0.17) is slightly below average, while self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55) are notably above average, with weak negative correlations to perceived stress. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance across multiple semesters, achieving a 4.0 GPA in the most recent fall semester.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a lifestyle characterized by high physical activity and very low substance use. Exercise frequency is consistently high, with self-reported engagement in solitary exercise and sports three or more times a week (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58, respectively), and exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53). All types of substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, are reported as ""not at all,"" with corresponding negative Z-scores. Conversely, engagement in various daily recreational activities appears notably limited. The participant reports ""do not do"" for watching TV/videos, video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, suggesting a highly focused or perhaps restricted leisure profile. A particularly salient finding is the very low reported time spent socializing with friends, at ""16-30 minutes"" (Z-score -1.41), which is significantly below the population average and, despite a weak correlation, could indicate reduced social support resources.

Sleep patterns are exceptionally robust. The participant exhibits excellent subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), classifying them as a ""Good Sleeper."" Objective Fitbit data corroborates this, showing a remarkably long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score 2.03), significantly exceeding the study population average. Sleep duration and start time variability are both close to the population mean (Z-scores -0.15 and -0.09, respectively), indicating consistent sleep habits. The median sleep start time of 22:50:14 suggests a relatively early bedtime for a university student, and the participant reports no daily naps.

Physiological data derived from heart rate metrics further elucidate daily activity and autonomic regulation. The participant's resting heart rate (54.9 bpm, Z-score -0.39) is below average, generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm features are largely within normative ranges, with average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.24), intraday variability (Z-score 0.39), and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.03), suggesting a reasonably regular daily physiological rhythm. However, the hourly aggregate heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Heart rate is markedly suppressed during the early morning hours, reflecting sleep, and then exhibits sharp and sustained increases from 8 AM, peaking between 9 AM and 11 AM (Z-scores 1.6 to 2.06), reflecting periods of high physiological activity likely associated with academic demands. Another notable peak occurs in the late afternoon (4-5 PM, Z-score 1.05), with a general decline towards evening, indicating a typical but pronounced pattern of daily physiological engagement.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several strong protective factors typically associated with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported depressive symptoms are below average, classifying them as ""not depressed"" (CESD Z-score -0.24, positive correlation with PSS 0.28, suggesting lower PSS). Sleep quality is excellent (PSQI Z-score -1.26), and objective sleep duration is remarkably long (Z-score 2.03, median 8 hours 49 minutes), both indicating robust restorative processes. The resting heart rate is low (Z-score -0.39), generally reflecting good cardiovascular health, and its weak positive correlation with PSS suggests lower RHR predicts lower PSS. The participant engages in frequent and varied physical activity, which is a known buffer against stress, and reports no substance usage, further indicating a lifestyle free from maladaptive coping mechanisms. High academic achievement (consistent high GPA) and above-average self-reported happiness and health satisfaction also suggest a baseline of well-being that could mitigate stress perception.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
A primary indicator for potentially elevated perceived stress is the participant's elevated trait anxiety, as evidenced by an STAI score classifying them as ""anxious"" (Z-score 0.56). This measure holds a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.31), directly linking this stable psychological trait to higher perceived stress. While the participant's exercise habits are strong, their engagement in diverse recreational activities is notably limited, and crucially, time spent socializing with friends is significantly below average (Z-score -1.41). A lack of social engagement and varied leisure pursuits can reduce access to stress-buffering social support and alternative coping mechanisms, potentially contributing to higher overall stress perception. The physiological data, while showing appropriate daily rhythms, also indicates high peaks of activity during academic hours, which in the context of high trait anxiety and limited social outlets, could represent a sustained, demanding physiological and psychological load.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Upon holistic analysis, the evidence presents a mixed but ultimately interpretable picture. While the participant exhibits exemplary physical health, sleep patterns, and academic performance, these robust coping mechanisms appear to exist alongside a significant psychological predisposition to anxiety. The elevated trait anxiety (STAI), a direct measure of an individual's proneness to experience nervousness and worry, is a powerful predictor of perceived stress. Despite excellent sleep and exercise acting as potential buffers or compensatory strategies, the underlying anxious disposition likely contributes to a higher internal experience of stress. Furthermore, the very limited social interaction and narrow range of recreational activities suggest potential vulnerabilities in terms of social support and diverse stress-reduction outlets. Weighing the evidence, the elevated trait anxiety, combined with potentially isolated social and leisure habits, suggests that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, is likely to be above the median for the study population.

70125,29.0,0.9715025906735751,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by notable psychological distress, alongside disrupted sleep patterns and specific behavioral tendencies, despite engaging in regular physical activity. Self-report measures indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms, with a CES-D score of 24.0 (Z-score 1.11), classifying the participant as 'depressed' relative to the study population. Similarly, trait anxiety is notably high, reflected by a STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86), classified as 'anxious'. These psychological states are further corroborated by below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95) and significantly low self-reported trust (Z-score -1.74), suggesting a generalized sense of unease or interpersonal caution. Conversely, self-esteem is near the population average, and reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), which presents a nuanced picture but does not overshadow the prominent indicators of distress.

Sleep patterns are demonstrably irregular and of compromised quality, as indicated by both subjective and objective data. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, though having a near-average Z-score (0.13), clinically denotes disturbed sleep. This subjective report is strongly supported by wearable data, revealing a significantly high standard deviation in sleep duration (159 minutes, Z-score 1.32) and above-average variability in sleep start time (99 minutes, Z-score 0.36). The median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours 57 minutes, with a late median sleep start time of 01:44:30. These metrics collectively suggest inconsistent sleep-wake cycles and poor sleep consolidation. Furthermore, circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate data show below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.57) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.7), along with a lower amplitude (Z-score -0.52), indicating less robust and regular daily physiological rhythms, which aligns with disrupted sleep and potentially heightened stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a strong commitment to physical activity, exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07) and engaging in group exercise 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53). This level of activity is generally associated with positive health outcomes. However, a contrasting pattern emerges in recreational habits, with below-average engagement in several typical leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies. Internet usage, conversely, is above average (Z-score 0.85). Alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor) is moderately above average. Physiologically, while the resting heart rate is notably low (53.0 bpm, Z-score -0.61), indicating good cardiovascular fitness, the hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced elevation in physiological arousal during the evening hours, particularly between 7-8 PM, where the mean deviation from the mesor reaches 17.41 (Z-score 1.03). This elevated evening arousal, despite good underlying cardiovascular health, could impede the natural winding-down process and contribute to the observed sleep disturbances and overall perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological state is a strong indicator of elevated perceived stress. Their CES-D score of 24.0 (Z-score 1.11) places them more than one standard deviation above the population mean for depressive symptoms, and this scale shows a positive correlation with PSS (0.28). Similarly, the STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86) indicates nearly one standard deviation above the mean for trait anxiety, also positively correlated with PSS (0.31). The presence of clinically significant sleep disturbance, as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0, further supports elevated stress levels, given that poor sleep is both a symptom and a contributor to stress. Objective wearable data reinforces this with significantly high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.32) and above-average variability in sleep start time (Z-score 0.36), pointing to highly irregular sleep-wake patterns. Moreover, the reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.57) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.7) in heart rate circadian rhythms suggest less regular daily physiological functioning, which can be associated with increased stress. The pronounced evening physiological arousal (7-8 PM HR deviation Z-score 1.03) further suggests a potential difficulty in achieving a relaxed state, which could contribute to elevated perceived stress and interfere with sleep onset. Finally, the observed low engagement in various recreational activities could signify a withdrawal from stress-buffering behaviors.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Several factors might suggest a lower or average perceived stress level. The participant's self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score 0.11), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), with both typically correlating negatively with PSS. Physically, the participant exhibits a very healthy resting heart rate (Z-score -0.61), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, which is generally a protective factor against stress. Furthermore, a high frequency of exercise, both alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 0.53), is a known adaptive coping mechanism for stress, suggesting active efforts to manage well-being.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
Despite the positive indicators such as good physical fitness, regular exercise, average self-esteem, and slightly elevated happiness, the cumulative evidence strongly points towards a participant experiencing elevated perceived stress. The significant levels of self-reported depressive and anxious symptoms, which are highly correlated with perceived stress, are particularly compelling. These psychological factors are further compounded by consistent objective and subjective evidence of highly disturbed and irregular sleep patterns, along with less stable physiological circadian rhythms and elevated evening arousal. While exercise is a beneficial coping strategy, it appears insufficient to fully mitigate the profound psychological distress and physiological dysregulation observed. Therefore, considering the robust and multi-modal evidence of psychological burden, disrupted sleep, and physiological patterns indicative of heightened arousal, it is highly probable that this participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

67192,31.0,0.9948186528497409,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a comprehensive profile indicating elevated psychological distress and physiological arousal, accompanied by distinct behavioral patterns. Self-report measures reveal significantly high scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at 32.0 (Z-score = 1.95), classifying them as ""Depressed,"" and on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 58.0 (Z-score = 1.65), classifying them as ""Anxious."" Both of these metrics exhibit positive correlations with perceived stress. Further supporting this, the participant reports low happiness (Z-score = -1.61) and very low satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score = -2.03), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Trust in others is also notably low (Z-score = -2.39). Academically, a substantial decline in GPA from 3.17 in Fall 2015 to 2.02 in Fall 2016 suggests potential academic difficulties or stressors influencing performance.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" placing them slightly above the population average (Z-score = 0.13). While Fitbit data shows an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score = 0.1), there is significantly higher variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 110 minutes, Z-score = 0.59), which positively correlates with perceived stress. Additionally, the participant reports a higher frequency of napping (Z-score = 0.7), also positively correlated with perceived stress. This combination suggests that inconsistent sleep scheduling and potential reliance on naps, rather than insufficient total sleep, are the primary sleep-related concerns.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a heightened state of arousal. Their mean heart rate (Mesor = 88.67 bpm, Z-score = 2.01) and resting heart rate (71.8 bpm, Z-score = 1.62) are both significantly elevated compared to the study population and positively correlated with perceived stress. Despite this elevated baseline, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm exhibits strong regularity, with above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 0.91) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 1.23), both negatively correlated with perceived stress. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs at 5:12 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates the lowest heart rate activity between 5-6 AM (deviation -20.79 bpm). Conversely, heart rate remains elevated late into the evening, with a particularly pronounced positive deviation between 10-11 PM (16.29 bpm, Z-score = 1.55) and 11-12 AM (9.55 bpm, Z-score = 0.91), suggesting sustained physiological activity or arousal before bedtime.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in a high level of social interaction, reporting more than 4 hours daily socializing with friends (Z-score = 2.53). Concurrently, there is a notable preference for sedentary recreational activities, including significantly more time watching TV/videos (Z-score = 1.28), playing video games (Z-score = 2.47), and listening to music (Z-score = 1.13) compared to the population average. It is notable that engagement in video games is negatively correlated with perceived stress. The participant reports not engaging in reading (Z-score = -0.67) or sedentary hobbies (Z-score = -0.96). Exercise frequency is within the average range (1-2 times a week for both solitary and social exercise), and sports are not pursued. Substance use involves moderate consumption of wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.94), while other substance use is minimal.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

The most compelling evidence for a high Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score lies within the participant's self-reported psychological state. Significantly elevated scores on the CES-D (Z-score = 1.95) and STAI (Z-score = 1.65), both classifying the participant as ""Depressed"" and ""Anxious"" respectively, are strongly and positively correlated with perceived stress. These indicate substantial psychological distress far exceeding the population average. Furthermore, low scores for happiness (Z-score = -1.61) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -2.03), both negatively correlated with PSS, corroborate a generally negative affective state. Physiologically, a high resting heart rate (Z-score = 1.62) and elevated overall average heart rate (Mesor Z-score = 2.01), both positively correlated with PSS, point to a heightened state of physiological arousal consistent with chronic stress. The sustained elevated heart rate into late evening hours, particularly from 10-11 PM (Z-score = 1.55), suggests difficulty downregulating physiological activity. Sleep patterns also contribute to this picture, with high variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 0.59) and increased napping (Z-score = 0.7), both positively correlated with PSS, indicative of potentially disorganized sleep architecture associated with stress. The observed decline in academic performance (GPA from 3.17 to 2.02) serves as a behavioral indicator often associated with increased stress and challenges in coping.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

Conversely, some data points suggest factors that might typically mitigate stress. The participant exhibits good stability and regularity in their heart rate-based circadian rhythm, as indicated by above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 0.91) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = 1.23), both negatively correlated with PSS. This underlying physiological regularity could be a protective factor. Behaviorally, the participant reports spending a significantly high amount of time socializing with friends (Z-score = 2.53), which is commonly associated with social support and lower stress, although its correlation with PSS in this dataset is weakly positive. Additionally, high engagement in video games (Z-score = 2.47) is negatively correlated with perceived stress, potentially serving as a positive coping or distraction mechanism. The participant's median sleep duration is also average (Z-score = 0.1), suggesting that insufficient sleep quantity is not a primary issue.

**Holistic Analysis:**

Synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the participant experiences a high level of perceived stress. The profound and highly significant deviations in self-reported psychological measures (depression, anxiety, happiness, health satisfaction) are strong, direct indicators of elevated stress, supported by their positive correlations with PSS. These psychological factors are further compounded by clear physiological markers of chronic arousal, including an elevated resting heart rate and overall higher heart rate mesor. While the participant's heart rate circadian rhythm shows structural regularity, the elevated baseline and sustained late-night physiological activity suggest this consistency occurs at a higher-than-optimal state of arousal. Disorganized sleep patterns, characterized by inconsistent sleep timing rather than duration, also align with increased perceived stress. Although the participant engages in robust social interaction and certain recreational activities, these seemingly adaptive behaviors are insufficient to offset the pervasive psychological distress and physiological hyperarousal observed across other metrics. Therefore, the magnitude and consistency of the self-reported distress, physiological indicators, and disrupted sleep patterns strongly suggest the participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population.

97448,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by a relatively low burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Scores on the CES-D (3.0, Z-score: -1.07) and STAI-Trait (33.0, Z-score: -0.82) are both notably below the study population average, indicating reduced self-reported distress in these domains. These measures also show positive correlations with PSS, suggesting that lower scores are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem is above average (41.0, Z-score: 0.4), a factor that typically correlates negatively with perceived stress. While current happiness is slightly below average (3.0, Z-score: -0.53), its correlation with PSS is also negative, aligning with a potentially lower stress level. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (3.67, Z-score: -0.45), but overall, the participant’s self-reported psychological well-being markers suggest resilience or a lower baseline of internalizing symptoms. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently strong GPAs, further suggests effective academic coping or minimal academic-related stress.

Regarding sleep patterns, a notable discrepancy exists between subjective experience and objective consistency. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as experiencing ‘Disturbed Sleep’, placing them slightly below the population average for PSQI (Z-score: -0.33), but still above the clinical threshold for sleep disturbance. In contrast, wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes, which is average for the population (Z-score: 0.02). Furthermore, objective sleep consistency is high, with low standard deviations for both sleep duration (63 minutes, Z-score: -0.86) and sleep start time (63 minutes, Z-score: -0.43). This suggests that while the participant perceives their sleep quality as disturbed, the timing and duration of their sleep episodes are objectively quite regular and stable. The participant also reports a slightly above-average frequency of daily naps (Z-score: 0.7), which may complement nightly sleep.

The participant demonstrates a remarkably robust and stable physiological circadian rhythm. Key metrics derived from heart rate data, such as Interdaily Stability (0.53, Z-score: 1.0) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.46, Z-score: 1.15), are significantly above the population average, indicating highly predictable and regular daily heart rate patterns. A strong circadian Amplitude (14.78, Z-score: 1.29) further supports a clear distinction between periods of rest and activity, which also correlates negatively with PSS. The Mesor (72.79, Z-score: -0.16), representing the average heart rate over the recording period, is within the average range. The participant's resting heart rate (50.8 bpm, Z-score: -0.87) is considerably lower than the population average, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, and correlates positively with PSS. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with deep physiological troughs during early morning hours (e.g., -28.16 bpm at 5-6 AM, Z-score: -1.42) and significant peaks of activity/arousal during the late morning, afternoon (e.g., +19.12 bpm at 2-3 PM, Z-score: 2.23), and evening (e.g., +21.56 bpm at 8-9 PM, Z-score: 2.1). The acrophase, or peak of activity, is observed at 5:00 PM. The prominence of evening heart rate peaks, particularly between 8-10 PM (Z-scores ~2.1), suggests sustained physiological activity extending into the later parts of the day.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports above-average consumption of beer (Z-score: 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score: 0.94), although recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise patterns indicate a strong preference for solitary physical activity, with frequent exercise alone (Z-score: 1.07) but no engagement in group exercise or sports. Daily recreational habits include average time spent socializing with friends and watching TV/videos. Notably, the participant spends a significantly above-average amount of time reading (Z-score: 1.3), a habit that correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21). Conversely, engagement in video games and listening to music is very low or non-existent (Z-scores: -0.56 and -1.19 respectively). Overall, the behavioral data paint a picture of an individual with some consistent, potentially stress-mitigating habits like regular solitary exercise and reading, balanced with moderate alcohol consumption and a preference for individual rather than social recreation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score likely falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the cumulative evidence. The population PSS data indicates a 50th percentile at 22.0.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower PSS score stems from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. Both depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 3.0, Z-score: -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI score of 33.0, Z-score: -0.82) are significantly below the population average. Given the strong positive correlations of CES-D (0.28) and STAI (0.31) with PSS, these low scores are robust indicators of lower perceived stress. Furthermore, above-average self-esteem (Z-score: 0.4) and consistent strong academic performance likely contribute to a lower stress profile.
Physiologically, the participant exhibits a highly stable and well-regulated circadian rhythm, evidenced by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 1.0), Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 1.15), and Amplitude (Z-score: 1.29). These metrics consistently correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting that a robust physiological rhythm is associated with reduced stress. A significantly low resting heart rate (50.8 bpm, Z-score: -0.87) further supports good physiological regulation. Objectively, sleep patterns show high consistency in both duration and start time (low standard deviations, Z-scores: -0.86 and -0.43 respectively). Behavioral habits such as frequent solitary exercise (Z-score: 1.07) and substantial time spent reading (Z-score: 1.3), which correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21), likely act as positive coping mechanisms.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The primary piece of evidence suggesting potentially elevated stress is the self-reported 'Disturbed Sleep' classified by the PSQI score of 6.0. While objective sleep metrics indicate consistency, the subjective experience of poor sleep quality is a known contributor to perceived stress. Additionally, the notably high hourly heart rate deviations observed in the evening (e.g., 8-10 PM, Z-scores ~2.1) could reflect sustained physiological arousal late in the day, potentially impacting sleep quality and stress levels. Slightly below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.45) might also indicate underlying stressors, although their correlations with PSS are relatively weak. Above-average alcohol consumption, while having negligible PSS correlations in this dataset, can sometimes be a coping mechanism for stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When weighing the evidence, the indicators for a lower perceived stress level are more numerous, consistent, and strongly correlated with PSS. The profoundly low scores on established measures of depression and anxiety, combined with robust physiological circadian stability and a healthy resting heart rate, strongly suggest effective stress management or a lower intrinsic level of stress. While subjective sleep disturbance and evening physiological arousal peaks are noted, these are largely counterbalanced by objective sleep consistency and overall strong mental health markers. Therefore, the participant is most likely to experience perceived stress at a level below or around the population median.

67177,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress and problematic lifestyle patterns, alongside a physiologically robust but elevated circadian heart rate rhythm.

**Psychological State & Well-being:**
The participant reports elevated levels of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 16.0 classifying them as ""Depressed,"" and trait anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 46.0 classified as ""anxious."" Both scores are slightly above the population average (Z-scores of 0.28 and 0.46 respectively) and exhibit positive correlations with perceived stress. More notably, self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61), self-esteem (Z-score -1.01), health satisfaction (Z-score -1.2), and trust (Z-score -1.1) are all significantly lower than the study population average. These negative deviations indicate a generalized sense of low well-being, diminished self-worth, and reduced social engagement, all of which are frequently associated with heightened perceived stress. A critical finding is the dramatic decline in academic performance, with the GPA dropping from 3.38 to 1.9 in the most recent semester, suggesting a significant struggle that could be a major stressor or a consequence of underlying distress.

**Behavioral Habits & Lifestyle:**
Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a notably sedentary lifestyle. They report no engagement in exercise, whether alone or with others, or in organized sports, with Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93, indicating significantly less physical activity than their peers. While substance use is reported as ""not at all"" across all categories (with very low Z-scores), reflecting minimal engagement in these behaviors, this does not mitigate the substantial lack of physical activity. Daily recreational habits lean heavily towards passive media consumption, with above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and using the internet (Z-score 0.85). In contrast, time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) is below average, and there is no reported engagement in reading or other sedentary hobbies. This pattern suggests a potentially isolating lifestyle with limited active engagement and social interaction, which can contribute to psychological distress. Furthermore, a Body Mass Index of 30.04 places the participant in the obese category, which may contribute to lower health satisfaction and overall well-being.

**Sleep Patterns:**
Subjectively, the participant's sleep quality is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 7.0, a value commonly indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance, though their Z-score is only slightly above the population mean (0.13). Objectively, Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 54 minutes, which is slightly below the recommended range (Z-score -0.35), but not severely curtailed. Variability in both sleep duration and sleep start times is average, suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule despite the participant's subjective experience of poor sleep quality. This discrepancy indicates that while sleep timing and duration are somewhat stable, other factors contributing to subjective sleep quality are likely compromised.

**Physiological Arousal & Circadian Rhythm:**
Cardiovascular data reveals a strong underlying circadian rhythmicity. The participant exhibits higher-than-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.24) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score 1.40), along with lower-than-average Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.74). This profile indicates a highly regular and structured daily heart rate pattern. However, the overall physiological baseline appears elevated, with a higher-than-average Mesor (Z-score 1.11) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.84). This suggests a state of elevated cardiovascular activity throughout the day, which could reflect chronic physiological arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness, despite the regularity of their daily rhythm. The Acrophase, indicating the time of peak heart rate activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:34 PM, aligning with observed peak hourly heart rate deviations which reach approximately 18 bpm above the Mesor in the late afternoon and early evening. This pattern suggests significant physiological activity during typical waking hours. The correlations indicate that while strong circadian rhythms (high IS, low IV, high autocorrelation, high amplitude) are typically associated with lower perceived stress, the participant's elevated Mesor and RHR are positively associated with higher perceived stress, suggesting a robust but elevated physiological system potentially under chronic strain.

---

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50% of the population) is substantial and pervasive across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains. The participant reports significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD) and trait anxiety (STAI), both positively correlated with higher perceived stress. Even more indicative are the profoundly low self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction, and trust scores, with Z-scores well below -1.0, all of which are negatively correlated with PSS, meaning lower scores on these metrics are associated with higher perceived stress. The dramatic decline in GPA to 1.9 in the most recent semester is a compelling real-world indicator of significant academic pressure or difficulty contributing to stress. Behaviorally, the participant's nearly complete lack of exercise and reduced social engagement, coupled with an obese BMI, are known risk factors and consequences of elevated stress. Furthermore, the self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI score of 7.0) points to subjective sleep issues often associated with stress. Physiologically, while aspects of their circadian rhythm demonstrate healthy regularity (high Interdaily Stability and 24-hour Autocorrelation, low Intradaily Variability, high Amplitude), these are counterbalanced by a higher-than-average Mesor and Resting Heart Rate (Z-scores 1.11 and 0.84, respectively). These elevated physiological baselines are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting a state of chronic physiological arousal consistent with heightened perceived stress.

Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score (bottom 50% of the population) is limited. The participant's minimal substance use could be interpreted as a protective factor, but this is a minor point compared to the overwhelming evidence of distress. The notable regularity and strong structure of their heart rate-based circadian rhythms (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability, high 24-hour Autocorrelation, and high Amplitude) are generally considered beneficial for health and are associated with lower PSS in the study population. However, this physiological strength appears insufficient to counteract the multitude of other stressors and indicators of distress.

Considering the cumulative weight of evidence, particularly the pronounced psychological distress (depressive symptoms, anxiety, critically low self-esteem and happiness), significant academic challenges, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (lack of exercise, social isolation), and sustained physiological arousal (elevated Mesor and RHR), it is highly probable that the participant's perceived stress level is elevated compared to their peers. The beneficial aspects of their circadian rhythmicity are outweighed by the pervasive indicators of high stress.

87328,15.0,0.038860103626943004,"This participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile characterized by low self-reported distress and high positive affect. Their scores on the CES-D and STAI instruments are exceptionally low (Z-scores of -1.38 and -1.81, respectively), indicating a notable absence of depressive or anxious symptoms compared to the study population. Complementing this, the participant reports very high self-esteem (Z-score 1.66) and happiness (Z-score 1.64), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Academic performance, as reflected by a consistently high GPA (ranging from 3.8 to 3.92), further suggests effective management of academic demands. In terms of coping and engagement, the participant exhibits significant involvement in positive leisure activities; they spend more than four hours socializing with friends daily (Z-score 2.53) and engage in substantial reading (Z-score 2.28), an activity negatively correlated with perceived stress. While moderate in general exercise, participation in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91) is also noted, and the absence of substance use across all categories underscores a healthy lifestyle choice.

Regarding sleep and daily habits, a nuanced pattern emerges. The participant reports a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes, which is average for the population (Z-score 0.3), and demonstrates consistent sleep patterns with below-average variability in both sleep duration and start time (Z-scores -0.57 and -0.72, respectively). However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates subjectively ""disturbed sleep,"" despite the objectively measured consistency in duration and timing. This discrepancy might suggest issues with sleep quality not captured by duration metrics. Additionally, the participant engages in above-average napping (Z-score 1.21), which could be a compensatory behavior related to this perceived sleep disturbance. The median sleep start time is relatively late at 1:26 AM. Daily recreational habits also show high engagement in sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos (3-4 hours, Z-score 2.54) and video games (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 1.71), alongside their high social engagement and reading. Health satisfaction is reported as below average (Z-score -1.2), potentially influenced by their BMI of 27.12, though this does not appear to significantly impact their overall psychological well-being.

Physiological data from wearables reveal a highly regular and robust circadian rhythm, indicative of good autonomic nervous system regulation. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.57), both negatively correlated with perceived stress, signifying consistent daily patterns in their heart rate. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also notably high (Z-score 1.78), indicating a clear distinction between peak and trough heart rate values, further supporting a strong and well-entrained circadian rhythm. The resting heart rate of 54.4 bpm (Z-score -0.45) is below the population average, generally reflecting good cardiovascular fitness and lower chronic physiological arousal. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor shows expected deep nocturnal troughs, particularly between 2-6 AM (Z-scores down to -1.17), consistent with sleep. Daytime and evening hours show elevations, with a significant peak in activity and physiological arousal observed between 6-7 PM (Z-score 2.62), aligning with the recorded acrophase of 5:40 PM. This pattern suggests a vigorous physiological response to daily demands during peak activity times, rather than chronic elevation, further reinforcing a profile of robust physiological regulation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is strongly indicated to be in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial and pervasive across self-report and physiological measures:
*   **Psychological Measures:** The participant reports remarkably low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -1.38) and anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.81). Both measures have positive correlations with PSS, meaning lower scores are associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score 1.66) and happiness (Z-score 1.64) are present, both demonstrating negative correlations with PSS, indicating a strong protective factor against stress. High engagement in reading (Z-score 2.28), which has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.2), also supports lower stress.
*   **Behavioral Habits:** The absence of substance use and regular participation in sports (Z-score 0.91, correlation -0.12 with PSS) suggest healthy coping mechanisms. Strong social engagement (Z-score 2.53) typically provides a buffer against stress.
*   **Physiological & Sleep Metrics:** Circadian rhythm features display high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0), high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.57), and a high amplitude (Z-score 1.78). All of these metrics are negatively correlated with PSS, signifying robust and regular physiological rhythms associated with lower stress. The resting heart rate is below average (54.4 bpm, Z-score -0.45), and lower RHR is associated with lower stress. Sleep duration and start time exhibit low variability (Z-scores -0.57 and -0.72 respectively), which is positively correlated with PSS, meaning low variability predicts lower stress.

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is comparatively limited:
*   **Sleep Quality:** The self-reported PSQI score of 7.0, categorized as ""disturbed sleep,"" is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.13). Above-average napping (Z-score 1.21) is also positively correlated with PSS (0.15). While these suggest some sleep challenges, they are largely counterbalanced by consistent objective sleep duration and robust circadian regulation.
*   **Health Satisfaction:** Low self-reported health satisfaction (Z-score -1.2) is a potential, though weak, stressor.
*   **Hourly HR Deviation:** The very high heart rate deviation at 6-7 PM (Z-score 2.62) indicates significant physiological activity, which could theoretically contribute to stress. However, in the context of a robust circadian amplitude and low RHR, it is more likely indicative of vigorous daily activity rather than chronic distress.

Considering the entirety of the evidence, the participant's low self-reported psychological distress, high positive affect, healthy coping behaviors, and exceptionally robust physiological regulation strongly outweigh the isolated indicators of sleep disturbance or lower health satisfaction. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant experiences relatively low perceived stress.

49497,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a profile characterized by exceptionally high levels of psychological distress and negative affect. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, are extremely elevated (Score=49.0, Z-score=3.71), placing them significantly above the population mean and indicating a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. Similarly, trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is notably high (Score=64.0, Z-score=2.24), reflecting a disposition towards chronic anxiety. Consistent with these findings, self-esteem is remarkably low (Score=22.0, Z-score=-2.28), and self-reported happiness is also markedly reduced (Score=2.0, Z-score=-1.61). These metrics collectively suggest a pronounced state of psychological vulnerability and emotional distress, which are strongly correlated with higher perceived stress (CESD: r=0.28, STAI: r=0.31, Self-Esteem: r=-0.15, Happiness: r=-0.19). Academic performance, as indicated by a declining GPA from 3.8 to 3.2, may reflect the impact of these internal struggles on their academic engagement and success.

Sleep patterns for this participant are severely disrupted, contributing significantly to a potential state of elevated stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score=1.05) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. Fitbit data further substantiates this, showing below-average median sleep duration (6 hours 30 minutes, Z-score=-0.85) and, critically, exceptionally high variability in both sleep duration (Standard Deviation=148 minutes, Z-score=1.06) and sleep start times (Standard Deviation=204 minutes, Z-score=2.65). This extreme irregularity is mirrored in the wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics: Interdaily Stability is considerably low (Value=0.21, Z-score=-1.65), signifying highly inconsistent day-to-day patterns, while Intradaily Variability is slightly elevated (Value=0.63, Z-score=0.6), indicating more fragmented activity/rest cycles. Furthermore, the amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is significantly blunted (Value=5.95, Z-score=-1.56), suggesting a less pronounced distinction between peak and trough physiological activity. These sleep and circadian irregularities are associated with higher perceived stress, as indicated by positive correlations with sleep duration and start time variability, and negative correlations with interdaily stability and amplitude.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal, including a significant anomaly. While the overall resting heart rate (60.55 bpm, Z-score=0.29) is slightly above average, the hourly deviations from the mesor highlight specific periods of elevated activity. Expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate are observed, reaching their lowest point between 5-6 AM. However, a particularly notable and atypical elevation in heart rate occurs between 10-11 PM, showing a substantial positive deviation from the mesor (14.61 bpm, Z-score=1.29). This late-night surge in heart rate is counter to typical physiological winding-down processes and suggests heightened physiological arousal or significant activity occurring shortly before the participant's typically late sleep onset (Median Sleep Start Time 01:14:03). This pattern, especially when combined with a blunted circadian amplitude, could indicate chronic physiological activation or difficulty disengaging from daily stressors in the evening, contributing to the overall burden of stress and sleep disturbance.

The participant's behavioral patterns suggest engagement in potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms and limited social support. There is an extremely high frequency of recreational drug usage (1-2 times a week, Z-score=5.44) and non-prescribed drug usage (1-2 times a month, Z-score=13.79), far exceeding the study population average. While the direct correlations of these behaviors with PSS are negligible in this dataset, such extreme substance use is typically indicative of significant underlying psychological distress and may itself contribute to physiological dysregulation and overall stress. Socializing with friends is remarkably infrequent (16-30 minutes, Z-score=-1.41), suggesting limited social interaction, which can be both a symptom of distress and a lack of a protective factor against stress. High internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score=1.52) may serve as a compensatory activity but also potentially detracts from other health-promoting behaviors or sleep. These behavioral patterns, particularly the pronounced substance use and social withdrawal, suggest attempts to cope with internal distress that may exacerbate rather than alleviate their overall stress burden.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The participant's data presents substantial and compelling evidence strongly supporting a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score in the top 50% of the study population. Self-report measures show extremely high levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: 3.71, indicating a ""Depressed"" classification), and notably high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.24, indicating an ""anxious"" classification). Both of these scales exhibit moderate positive correlations with PSS. Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score: -2.28) and happiness (Z-score: -1.61) are significantly low, with negative correlations to PSS, further reinforcing a profound state of elevated psychological distress. Academic performance has shown a declining trend, which is often associated with increased stress and mental health challenges.

Wearable and self-reported sleep metrics also point robustly towards high stress. The participant reports clinically disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score: 1.05) and exhibits significantly below-average sleep duration alongside extremely high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score: 1.06) and sleep start times (Z-score: 2.65). Circadian rhythm parameters from heart rate data further indicate dysregulation, with significantly low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.65) and a blunted amplitude (Z-score: -1.56), suggesting an irregular and less robust physiological rhythm. The marked physiological anomaly of a significant heart rate surge late in the evening (10-11 PM, Z-score: 1.29) points to heightened arousal preceding a late sleep onset, indicative of difficulty in stress recovery or engagement in late-night activities.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in extremely elevated recreational drug usage (Z-score: 5.44) and non-prescribed drug usage (Z-score: 13.79). While the direct correlations of these behaviors with PSS are negligible in this specific dataset, such extreme substance use is widely recognized as a strong indicator of underlying psychological distress and maladaptive coping strategies, inherently contributing to overall stress. Social interaction is notably low (Socializing with Friends Z-score: -1.41), representing a potential lack of social support and increased isolation, which are known contributors to stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a PSS score in the bottom 50% is minimal and not sufficiently robust to counter the overwhelming evidence for high stress. The participant's overall satisfaction with physical health is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.55), but this correlation with PSS is weak and negative (-0.08), making it a minor counterpoint. Resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.29), but not exceptionally low, and its positive correlation with PSS suggests it might even contribute to higher stress. Some average engagement in exercise alone and certain recreational activities like watching TV or reading are present, but these are minor factors that do not significantly offset the strong indicators of distress and dysregulation. The mean daily naps are average, indicating no compensatory napping.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The comprehensive analysis reveals an individual experiencing profound psychological distress, characterized by very high depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with significantly low self-esteem and happiness. This internal state is exacerbated by severe and irregular sleep patterns, a disrupted physiological circadian rhythm, and a notable late-evening physiological arousal. Behavioral data highlights extremely concerning substance use and limited social engagement, strongly suggesting maladaptive coping strategies and a lack of protective social factors. The cumulative weight of these highly interconnected factors, particularly the extreme Z-scores on core psychological distress measures and the widespread sleep and physiological dysregulation, strongly points towards a pervasive experience of high perceived stress.

Therefore, based on the totality of the available evidence, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is highly likely to place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

33785,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable pattern of elevated psychological distress, as evidenced by self-report measures. Their score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is 27.0 (Z-score 1.42), classifying them as depressed, and this measure shows a positive correlation (0.29) with perceived stress. Similarly, their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI–Trait) score of 56.0 (Z-score 1.45) indicates an anxious classification, with a moderate positive correlation (0.32) with perceived stress. This suggests a predisposition to experience anxiety, which is directly linked to higher perceived stress. Furthermore, a lower self-esteem score (32.0, Z-score -0.87), which typically negatively correlates with perceived stress (-0.16), contributes to this profile of psychological vulnerability. Despite these indicators, the participant reports average levels of happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.38), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, presenting a somewhat contrasting subjective experience of well-being. Academically, their GPA has shown variability but remains robust.

Sleep patterns demonstrate a mix of regularity and quality concerns. The participant reports disturbed sleep according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with a score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13), indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance. However, wearable data suggests a relatively stable sleep schedule, with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes (Z-score 0.18) and a notably low standard deviation in sleep start time (49 minutes, Z-score -0.75). This regularity in sleep initiation is paradoxically associated with higher perceived stress (correlation 0.17). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further reveal a highly regular physiological rhythm, characterized by average Interdaily Stability (0.48, Z-score 0.58) and exceptionally low Intradaily Variability (0.25, Z-score -2.08). While a strong, stable rhythm might typically be considered adaptive, this low variability is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.16), suggesting a potential rigidity in physiological responses or a consistent level of arousal that may be associated with elevated stress. The heart rate rhythm peaks in the late afternoon (Acrophase 4:49 PM), and the Amplitude (12.46, Z-score 0.54) is slightly above average, which is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.16), potentially indicating a healthy range of physiological activity. The participant's resting heart rate (58.7 bpm, Z-score 0.07) is within the average range.

An examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals typical diurnal variations, with the lowest heart rates occurring during the early morning hours (e.g., -23.45 bpm deviation at 5-6 AM) and increasing throughout the day to peak in the afternoon and evening. Notably, heart rate remains elevated significantly above the Mesor during the late evening, particularly between 10-11 PM (deviation 14.02 bpm, Z-score 1.19), suggesting sustained physiological activity or arousal into the night. Interestingly, a higher heart rate deviation during this specific hour is negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.15), which could imply that this late-night physiological activity, in this participant, is not necessarily indicative of *higher* perceived stress or could even be a compensatory factor.

Behavioral patterns show a mix of healthy and sedentary habits. The participant exercises alone frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07), though this specific behavior shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. Conversely, engagement in sports is minimal (""Not at all,"" Z-score -1.09). Recreational habits include substantial time spent on video games (""1-2 hours,"" Z-score 2.47) and sedentary hobbies (""2-3 hours,"" Z-score 2.01), both notably high relative to the population. A significant amount of time is also dedicated to reading (""16-30 minutes,"" Z-score 1.3), which has a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.21), suggesting it may serve as a protective or coping mechanism. Substance use is moderate for beer and low for wine/liquor. Overall, the participant's lifestyle includes pronounced engagement in solitary and often sedentary leisure activities alongside regular independent exercise.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%)**

The strongest evidence for an elevated perceived stress score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological measures. Their CES-D score (27.0, Z-score 1.42) and STAI score (56.0, Z-score 1.45) are both well above the population mean, placing them over 1.4 standard deviations above average for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Both measures are positively correlated with PSS (0.29 for CES-D, 0.32 for STAI), indicating a strong association between these internal states and perceived stress. Lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.87), which is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.16), further supports a higher stress profile. Physiologically, the exceptionally low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -2.08) and lower standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score -0.75) are both positively correlated with PSS (0.16 and 0.17 respectively). This suggests that while their physiological and behavioral rhythms are highly stable, this rigidity or lack of adaptive flexibility may be associated with higher perceived stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**

Several factors suggest potential moderation or even lower perceived stress in some domains. The participant reports average to above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.38), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19 and -0.08, respectively). Engagement in reading is high (Z-score 1.3) and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.21), indicating a strong positive coping mechanism that may reduce overall stress. Physiologically, the heart rate Amplitude (Z-score 0.54) is slightly above average and negatively correlated with PSS (-0.16), suggesting a healthy range of daily physiological variation. Most notably, the participant exhibits a significantly elevated heart rate deviation from the Mesor during the late evening (10-11 PM, Z-score 1.19), which, counter-intuitively, is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15). This particular physiological pattern, despite indicating late-night activity, is associated with *lower* perceived stress in the study population.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**

Synthesizing the multimodal data, the predominant evidence points towards a perceived stress level in the top half of the study population. The high Z-scores for both depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D and STAI), coupled with their positive correlations with PSS, represent substantial self-reported psychological distress directly pertinent to perceived stress. While certain factors like higher happiness, health satisfaction, engagement in reading, and specific physiological patterns (e.g., high HR deviation 10-11 PM, higher amplitude) are negatively correlated with PSS and could mitigate stress, the magnitude and direct relevance of the self-reported mental health symptoms are compelling. The contradictory correlation of highly stable physiological rhythms (low Intradaily Variability, low sleep start time SD) with higher PSS is intriguing and suggests that for this individual, extreme regularity might be indicative of a less flexible system under stress, rather than a purely adaptive trait. Given the robust and significantly elevated indicators of anxiety and depression, it is highly probable that the participant experiences perceived stress at a level higher than the majority of the student population.

33009,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a mixed psychological profile, characterized by relatively low self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.45) and slightly below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.13). Self-esteem is above the population average (Z-score: 0.26). However, indicators of overall well-being suggest some compromise, with self-reported happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: -0.45) both being below the mean. These elements suggest that while overt distress symptoms may not be highly pronounced, aspects of subjective well-being are somewhat diminished.

Regarding sleep, a notable discrepancy emerges between self-reported quality and objective metrics. The participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (Score: 7.0, Z-score: 0.13), indicating subjective sleep difficulties. However, wearable data reveals an objectively robust sleep pattern: a longer than average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 54 minutes (Z-score: 0.89) and exceptionally low variability in both sleep duration (SD Z-score: -1.03) and sleep start times (SD Z-score: -0.61). This combination suggests consistent sleep hygiene in terms of duration and schedule, but an underlying issue with perceived sleep quality or restorative capacity, which may contribute to perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from heart rate metrics indicate a less robust and potentially strained autonomic and circadian system. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably blunted (Z-score: -0.92), suggesting a reduced range of physiological fluctuation between periods of activity and rest. Circadian regularity metrics also reflect dysregulation, with lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.49) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.45), implying less day-to-day consistency. Concurrently, intradaily variability is elevated (Z-score: 0.53), pointing to more fragmented hourly heart rate patterns. Analysis of aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals an intriguing pattern: while daytime heart rates show expected elevations, particularly a strong peak between 10-11 AM (Z-score: 0.92), there is a pronounced and relatively rapid decline in activity in the late afternoon and evening, with hourly deviations being significantly lower than the population average from 4 PM onwards (e.g., 9-10 PM Z-score: -1.38). Paradoxically, during the deep sleep hours of 2-7 AM, the heart rate is less depressed than the population average, supporting the self-reported disturbed sleep and suggesting potential nocturnal physiological arousal despite sufficient sleep duration. The overall physiological profile points towards a system that may be experiencing higher allostatic load or struggling with optimal physiological recovery and rhythmicity.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains strong academic performance with consistently high GPAs. Exercise engagement is above average, both alone (Z-score: 0.32) and with others (Z-score: 0.53). Recreational habits show lower engagement in passive screen-based activities like TV, video games, and music, with slightly more time spent on internet usage, socializing, and reading. A notable lifestyle factor is the above-average frequency of wine or liquor consumption (Z-score: 0.94), which, while not directly correlated with PSS, could potentially serve as a coping mechanism or simply reflect social habits. Overall, the behavioral pattern suggests a combination of adaptive strategies (exercise, academic focus) alongside a physiological and subjective sleep profile that raises concerns regarding underlying stress or reduced resilience.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant's profile contains several indicators that typically correlate with lower perceived stress. Their self-reported depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z-score: -0.45), and trait anxiety is also slightly below the population mean (STAI Z-score: -0.13). High self-esteem (Z-score: 0.26) and consistent strong academic performance (GPAs) suggest effective coping and achievement in key life domains. Furthermore, the participant engages in above-average levels of exercise and demonstrates highly consistent sleep duration (7h 54m, Z-score: 0.89) and sleep start times (low standard deviation Z-scores for both), which are generally considered protective against stress. The resting heart rate is also average (Z-score: -0.01).

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, significant aspects of the participant's data point towards elevated perceived stress. The most prominent factor is the self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score: 0.13). This subjective experience of poor sleep quality, despite objective regularity and ample duration, is a strong correlate of perceived stress. The physiological data robustly supports a state of chronic physiological challenge: the heart rate rhythm exhibits a significantly blunted amplitude (Z-score: -0.92), alongside lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.49) and higher intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.53). These metrics collectively suggest a less adaptable, more fragmented, and less resilient autonomic system, consistent with a higher allostatic load often associated with chronic stress. The specific hourly heart rate patterns, showing less suppressed nocturnal heart rates during sleep, further align with the subjective experience of disturbed sleep. Additionally, the participant reports lower happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.45), and engages in above-average alcohol consumption (Wine/Liquor Z-score: 0.94), which could potentially be a coping mechanism for underlying stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits several strengths, including good academic performance, healthy exercise habits, and objective sleep regularity, the convergence of subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) with objective physiological dysregulation in circadian rhythms (blunted amplitude, lower stability, higher variability) strongly suggests an elevated level of perceived stress. The discrepancy between abundant and regular sleep and reported disturbed sleep quality is a critical indicator that the physiological recovery processes may be compromised, contributing to stress. The physiological markers of a less robust and more fragmented circadian rhythm, combined with the less suppressed nocturnal heart rates, provide compelling evidence of increased physiological load that outweighs the absence of elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms on self-report measures. Therefore, despite a functional behavioral profile, the underlying physiological and subjective sleep disturbances point to an experience of higher perceived stress.

96184,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a nuanced picture. While depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are below the study population average (Z-score -0.55), general trait anxiety, assessed by the STAI, is slightly above average (Z-score 0.07). Self-esteem is also slightly elevated (Z-Score 0.26), which generally serves as a protective factor against stress. However, self-reported happiness is notably below the population average (Z-score -0.53). Academic performance, as indicated by previous GPAs, is strong. Health satisfaction is average, and there is no reported use of alcohol or recreational drugs. Engagement in stress-buffering behaviors appears limited, with infrequent exercise both alone and with others (Z-scores -0.43 and -0.17 respectively), and significantly less time spent socializing with friends compared to peers (Z-score -1.41). Conversely, the participant spends a relatively high amount of time listening to music (Z-score 0.67), which may serve as a personal coping mechanism.

A critical area of concern emerges from the detailed sleep data. Self-reported sleep quality, via the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13), aligning with objective findings. Fitbit data reveal severely restricted sleep, with a median duration of only 5 hours and 27 minutes, significantly below the population average (Z-score -2.16). This already suboptimal sleep is further exacerbated by extreme variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score 5.88) and sleep start times (standard deviation Z-score 7.44). The median sleep start time is notably late at 04:42:17. This combination of short, highly irregular sleep suggests a profound lack of consistent restorative sleep. The higher-than-average frequency of napping (Z-score 1.27) likely reflects an attempt to compensate for chronic sleep deprivation, further disrupting the natural sleep-wake cycle.

Analysis of the participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals significant dysregulation. Interdaily stability (Z-score -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.79) are both markedly low, indicating a highly irregular and inconsistent daily physiological rhythm. This is supported by a slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.39), suggesting more fragmentation in activity and rest patterns within a day. The mesor (average heart rate, Z-score -1.0) and amplitude (peak-trough difference, Z-score -1.48) are both lower than average, suggesting a blunted overall physiological response and reduced robustness of the circadian rhythm. The acrophase, or the time of peak physiological activity, is observed relatively late in the day at 5:09 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal dips, but some positive Z-scores during early morning hours (e.g., 2-5 am) suggest heart rates that are less profoundly suppressed than typical for the population during these deep sleep periods, potentially indicating less restful physiological states. A significant deviation below the mesor is observed from 12-1 PM (Z-Score -1.55), which could reflect an atypical period of very low activity or physiological state during the middle of the day.

In summary, the participant demonstrates a significant and pervasive disruption in sleep patterns and physiological circadian rhythms. This is characterized by insufficient, highly variable, and late sleep, coupled with a highly unstable and blunted daily heart rate rhythm. While some psychological metrics like self-esteem and low depressive symptoms appear favorable, elevated trait anxiety and low happiness, combined with an underutilization of key stress-buffering behaviors (exercise, social interaction), suggest a vulnerability to stress. The objective physiological and sleep data strongly point towards a state of chronic physiological stress and dysregulation, which is often tightly linked with perceived stress levels.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

The most compelling evidence for an elevated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score stems from the profound and pervasive disruption in sleep and circadian rhythms. The participant's median sleep duration of 5 hours 27 minutes is significantly low (Z-score -2.16), while the extreme variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 5.88) and sleep start times (Z-score 7.44) indicates a highly inconsistent and likely unrefreshing sleep schedule. Self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0) further corroborates these objective findings. Physiologically, circadian rhythm metrics are severely dysregulated, with very low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.56) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.79), indicating a highly irregular physiological pattern. The blunted amplitude (Z-score -1.48) suggests a reduced physiological capacity to respond to daily demands. These objective indicators of severe sleep deprivation and chronic physiological dysregulation are strong correlates of elevated perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.07) and lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53), both of which positively correlate with PSS. Finally, engagement in common stress-buffering activities like exercise and socializing with friends is notably low, suggesting a lack of adaptive coping resources that could help mitigate stress. The increased frequency of napping (Z-score 1.27) is likely a compensatory mechanism for poor nighttime sleep, which can itself be a source of stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

The participant reports below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS, suggesting a lower likelihood of high stress based on this metric. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.26), a trait generally associated with lower stress levels. The participant also reports no substance use across all categories, indicating an avoidance of maladaptive coping mechanisms that might otherwise exacerbate stress. General health satisfaction is average. The resting heart rate is slightly lower than average (Z-score -0.32), which can sometimes indicate better cardiovascular health, although in the context of extreme circadian disruption, its interpretation regarding stress is more complex.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant demonstrates some strengths in psychological well-being, such as lower depressive symptoms and higher self-esteem, the cumulative and overwhelming evidence from objective physiological and behavioral data points strongly towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The profound and chronic disruption in sleep and circadian rhythms, characterized by severely restricted, highly irregular sleep and a dysregulated physiological rhythm, represents a significant and persistent stressor. This objective physiological strain, coupled with elevated trait anxiety, reduced happiness, and limited engagement in typical stress-buffering behaviors (exercise, social support), outweighs the mitigating factors. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant experiences a level of perceived stress that places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

79395,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The following analysis synthesizes multimodal psychological and behavioral data to provide insight into the participant’s psychological state, perceived stress, and associated behaviors.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The self-reported psychological measures indicate a significant burden of mental health symptoms and diminished well-being. The participant scored 32.0 on the CES-D, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.95, classifying them as experiencing ""Depressed"" symptoms, a measure positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.29). Similarly, their STAI-Trait score of 54.0 (Z-score = 1.25) places them in the ""anxious"" range, indicating elevated chronic anxiety, which also correlates positively with perceived stress (r=0.32). Further supporting this pattern, the participant reported notably lower self-esteem (RSES score 25.0, Z-score = -1.85), which is negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.16), implying that lower self-esteem is associated with higher stress. Self-reported happiness is also significantly below average (Current score 2.0, Z-score = -1.61, r=-0.19 with PSS). Health satisfaction is somewhat below the population mean (score 3.11, Z-score = -0.86). These findings collectively point to a pervasive pattern of psychological distress, anxiety, and negative self-perception, all of which are strongly associated with higher levels of perceived stress.

Subjective and objective sleep data present a mixed picture. The participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" though its Z-score of -0.33 suggests this is not an extreme deviation from the study population's average for sleep disturbance. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 15 minutes, which is average for the population (Z-score = 0.09). Notably, sleep timing appears highly regular; the standard deviation of sleep start times is 47 minutes (Z-score = -0.8), indicating more consistent bedtimes compared to peers. This regularity is further supported by a high interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.16) derived from heart rate data. The combination suggests that while sleep timing and duration are largely stable and adequate, the subjective experience of sleep quality is compromised, potentially impacting overall well-being.

In terms of daily activities and lifestyle, the participant reports above-average alcohol consumption, specifically 1-2 times a week for both beer (Z-score = 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is reported as ""Not at all."" Exercise habits include frequent activity with others (three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.23), alongside average engagement in solo exercise. Daily recreational habits indicate above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = 0.64) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = 0.82). Conversely, the participant reports no time spent on video games or reading, with reading showing a negative correlation with PSS (r=-0.21), suggesting its absence may be a contributing factor to stress for some individuals. Internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends are reported at average levels.

The participant exhibits a highly regular physiological circadian rhythm as derived from heart rate data. Interdaily stability (0.55, Z-score = 1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.46, Z-score = 1.15) are both notably high, indicating consistent day-to-day patterns in heart rate. Intradaily variability is below average (0.47, Z-score = -0.53), suggesting less erratic fluctuations within the day. The mesor (average heart rate) is 72.26 bpm (Z-score = -0.23), and the amplitude (peak-to-trough variation) is average (10.91, Z-score = 0.04). The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs at 5:26 PM. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average at 56.7 bpm (Z-score = -0.17), generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Examination of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor reveals typical nocturnal drops, reaching a minimum of -21.76 bpm between 5-6 AM. This indicates effective physiological rest, as the mean heart rate (72.26 - 21.76 = 50.5 bpm) during these hours drops below the reported resting heart rate, suggesting good nightly recovery. However, heart rate deviations from the mesor show notable elevations during the evening, particularly between 9-10 PM (+14.4 bpm, Z-score = 1.11) and 10-11 PM (+14.43 bpm, Z-score = 1.26). These high Z-scores indicate prolonged and elevated heart rate activity relative to the population mean during these late evening hours, potentially reflecting sustained physiological arousal that could impede relaxation despite the overall regularity of the circadian rhythm.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a high Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score (top 50th percentile) for this participant is substantial and primarily derived from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = 1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.25), both of which are positively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, remarkably low self-esteem (Z-score = -1.85) and happiness (Z-score = -1.61) are reported, which are negatively correlated with PSS, meaning lower scores on these measures are associated with higher perceived stress. Subjectively disturbed sleep, as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, could also contribute to elevated stress. Objectively, while the circadian rhythm demonstrates high regularity and the resting heart rate is healthy, the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals prolonged and elevated heart rate activity in the late evening (9-11 PM Z-scores: 1.11 and 1.26). This physiological arousal late in the day could interfere with relaxation and contribute to a subjective experience of stress.

Conversely, some evidence could be interpreted as potentially mitigating against an extremely high PSS score, suggesting a low to median score (bottom 50th percentile). The participant demonstrates notably high interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.16) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = 1.15) in heart rate patterns, reflecting consistent daily routines and rhythms. Similarly, sleep start times are more regular than average (Z-score = -0.8), and median sleep duration is adequate. These objective markers of routine and physiological regularity are generally considered protective factors against stress, with interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation showing negative correlations with PSS. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17), indicating good baseline cardiovascular health. Engaging in frequent exercise with others (Z-score = 1.23) also represents a positive coping behavior that can buffer stress.

Upon holistic analysis, the compelling and consistent self-reported psychological distress indicators, particularly the significantly high depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, strongly outweigh the protective effects observed in the objective physiological regularity and stable sleep patterns. While a consistent routine might offer some resilience and support general well-being, it does not appear sufficient to mitigate the pervasive subjective experience of anxiety, low mood, and diminished self-worth. The objective observation of elevated heart rates late into the evening further suggests a pattern of sustained arousal that likely contributes to the subjective burden. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, especially the severity of psychological symptoms directly linked to stress, it is highly probable that this participant's perceived stress level falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

59863,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant exhibits a notably positive psychological profile across several self-report measures. Depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CESD score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.86), are well below the population mean, classifying them as ""not depressed."" Similarly, trait anxiety is exceptionally low, with a STAI score of 24.0 (Z-score: -1.71), falling significantly below average and classified as ""not anxious."" This pattern of low psychological distress is further supported by a high self-esteem score of 50.0 (Z-score: 1.66) and a high self-reported happiness score of 5.0 (Z-score: 1.64), both considerably above the population average. Additionally, the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Score: 6.0, Z-score: 1.3). These indicators collectively suggest a robust mental well-being and a positive self-perception, factors generally associated with lower perceived stress. Academic performance is also consistently high, as evidenced by GPAs ranging from 3.7 to 3.82 across multiple semesters.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a healthy and active lifestyle. Substance usage is minimal, with no reported use of wine, liquor, recreational, or non-prescribed drugs (all Z-scores significantly negative). While beer consumption is slightly above average (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01), its correlation with PSS is negligible, suggesting it is likely a recreational habit rather than a stress-coping mechanism. Physical activity levels are high; the participant reports exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score: 1.07) and engaging in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91), both above population averages. Daily recreation also includes substantial reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score: 1.3), an activity known to be associated with lower stress levels (correlation: -0.21), as well as listening to music and socializing. These adaptive behaviors contribute to overall well-being and likely serve as protective factors against perceived stress.

Sleep patterns are generally indicative of good quality and consistency. The self-reported PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.8) falls within the ""Good Sleep"" classification and is below the average level of sleep disturbance in the population. Wearable data corroborates this, showing a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes (Z-score: 0.27), slightly above average. Crucially, the standard deviation of sleep duration (70 minutes, Z-score: -0.69) and sleep start time (73 minutes, Z-score: -0.21) are both lower than average, reflecting notable regularity in the participant's sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) further contributes to a structured and consistent sleep-wake cycle, typically associated with better sleep health.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a highly structured and robust circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.46, Z-score: 0.42) is slightly above average, and the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.4, Z-score: 0.64) is also elevated, indicating strong day-to-day regularity in activity patterns. Intradaily Variability is notably low (0.38, Z-score: -1.16), suggesting less fragmentation and greater consistency in physiological activity within each day. Furthermore, the heart rate amplitude (13.9, Z-score: 1.01) is significantly higher than average, indicative of a strong, well-defined daily physiological rhythm, with a peak acrophase around 4:23 PM. These robust circadian parameters generally point towards good physiological regulation and resilience.

Despite these positive indicators of rhythmicity, the participant exhibits a significantly elevated baseline of cardiovascular activity. The Mesor, representing the mean heart rate over a 24-hour cycle, is exceptionally high at 91.26 bpm (Z-score: 2.36), placing the participant substantially above the population average. Similarly, the resting heart rate of 67.65 bpm (Z-score: 1.13) is also higher than average. Analysis of the aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals sustained elevated heart rates during waking hours; for instance, heart rate deviates positively by 7.28 bpm during 8-9 AM (Z-score: 1.21) and by 12.39 bpm during 3-4 PM (Z-score: 0.63). These patterns indicate a chronic state of heightened physiological arousal or a very active physical lifestyle, which, while sometimes associated with higher stress, must be interpreted in context with the participant's otherwise positive psychological and behavioral profile.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents compelling evidence for a PSS score in the bottom 50th percentile. Psychologically, they report very low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.71), both of which show positive correlations with PSS, meaning lower scores here indicate lower perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66) and happiness (Z-score: 1.64) are remarkably high, with negative correlations to PSS, further supporting a lower perceived stress level. Self-reported health satisfaction is also high (Z-score: 1.3). Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle through exercise and sports, and engages in stress-reducing activities like reading, which shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.21). Their substance use habits are healthy, with minimal use of most substances. Sleep quality is good as per PSQI (Z-score: -0.8), and Fitbit data confirms consistent sleep duration and timing with low variability (Sleep Duration SD Z-score: -0.69; Sleep Start Time SD Z-score: -0.21), factors generally associated with lower stress. Furthermore, wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics like low Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.16), high Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 0.64), and high Amplitude (Z-score: 1.01) all suggest a robust and regular physiological rhythm, typically indicative of better regulation and lower stress.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The primary evidence suggesting a potentially higher PSS score comes from physiological measures indicating elevated cardiovascular activity. The Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) is exceptionally high at 91.26 bpm (Z-score: 2.36), and the resting heart rate is also above average at 67.65 bpm (Z-score: 1.13). Both of these metrics exhibit positive, albeit weak, correlations with PSS (Mesor: 0.07; RHR: 0.14), implying that higher values are associated with higher perceived stress. The aggregated hourly heart rate data further shows sustained heart rates above the already elevated Mesor during most waking hours, suggesting chronic physiological arousal. While these physiological findings are significant in their deviation from the population mean, their correlation strengths with PSS are less pronounced compared to the self-report psychological indicators.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the multimodal data holistically, there is a clear distinction between the participant's subjective experience and behavioral patterns versus some of their physiological markers. The overwhelming strength of evidence from self-reported psychological well-being measures (exceptionally low anxiety and depression, high self-esteem and happiness) and adaptive behavioral patterns (active lifestyle, healthy habits, good sleep) strongly points towards a low level of *perceived* stress. These psychological and behavioral factors are also supported by stronger correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale compared to the physiological indicators. While the elevated Mesor and Resting Heart Rate suggest a high baseline of physiological arousal, this could be partly attributable to a highly active lifestyle rather than psychological distress, or it may be a physiological stress load that the individual does not *perceive* as stress. Given that the Perceived Stress Scale directly assesses subjective perception of stress, the strong evidence from self-report and adaptive behaviors, coupled with stronger correlations for these metrics, leads to the conclusion that this participant's perceived stress level is likely below the population median.

22913,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by low self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, coupled with good subjective sleep quality. Specifically, their CESD score of 0.0 (Z-score -1.38) and STAI score of 34.0 (Z-score -0.72) place them significantly below the study population mean for these measures, indicating a low burden of depressive and anxious symptomatology. This is further supported by a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8), classified as ""Good Sleep."" The participant also reports average self-esteem (Z-score -0.03), trust (Z-score -0.14), and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.05). However, a notable point of divergence is their below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), which carries a negative correlation with perceived stress, suggesting that lower happiness may be associated with higher stress.

From a sleep and circadian rhythm perspective, the participant demonstrates remarkably long sleep durations, with a median of 8 hours and 37 minutes, placing them significantly above the population mean (Z-score 1.79). This extensive sleep duration is generally associated with restorative processes. Wearable data reveals a robust and stable circadian rhythm, indicated by significantly low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.8) and an above-average Amplitude (Z-score 0.84), suggesting a well-defined and consistent daily pattern of physiological activity. Conversely, the participant displays elevated baseline physiological arousal, with a Mesor (mean heart rate) of 87.24 bpm (Z-score 1.81) and a Resting Heart Rate (RHR) of 64.6 bpm (Z-score 0.77), both notably above the population average. This suggests a higher overall cardiovascular activity level, which could be indicative of heightened physiological strain or a generally aroused state. The hourly heart rate deviation data shows a typical daily pattern of lower heart rates during nocturnal hours and elevated rates during daytime activity, peaking around late morning to early afternoon, consistent with a generally high mesor.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle includes above-average alcohol consumption, with beer and wine/liquor usage reported ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively). In contrast, engagement in physical exercise is consistently low across all categories, with exercise frequency reported as ""1-2 times a month"" or ""Not at all"" (Z-scores ranging from -0.17 to -1.09). Recreational habits are also somewhat limited, with significantly below-average engagement in activities like internet usage (Z-score -1.16), listening to music (Z-score -1.19), reading (Z-score -0.67), and socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62). The absence of reading, in particular, is noteworthy given its moderate negative correlation with PSS. While these patterns suggest a potentially restricted repertoire of leisure and coping activities, the direct correlations with PSS are generally weak and varied, making it difficult to draw a direct link to perceived stress levels based on these alone. The participant maintains a consistent, average GPA across academic semesters.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

The participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, is likely to place them in the **bottom half of the study population distribution**.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being measures. Their exceptionally low scores on the CESD (Z-score -1.38) and STAI (Z-score -0.72) indicate minimal depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which are positively correlated with PSS scores. Similarly, a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8) signifies good subjective sleep quality, a factor generally associated with lower stress. Objectively, the participant benefits from a significantly long median sleep duration (8 hours 37 minutes, Z-score 1.79) and exhibits highly favorable circadian rhythm characteristics, including significantly low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.8) and above-average Amplitude (Z-score 0.84). These robust and stable physiological rhythms, especially the low intradaily variability, correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting a well-regulated physiological system that typically buffers against perceived stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Countervailing evidence includes a below-average self-reported happiness score (Z-score -0.53), which correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting a potential link to higher stress. Physiologically, the participant displays elevated baseline heart rate metrics, with a significantly high Mesor (Z-score 1.81) and above-average Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.77). These physiological indicators suggest a state of heightened arousal or strain, which can sometimes accompany or contribute to higher perceived stress. Additionally, above-average alcohol consumption and notably low engagement in physical exercise and various recreational activities (such as reading, internet usage, and listening to music) could be considered potential indicators of coping mechanisms or a restricted lifestyle that might be associated with higher stress, although the direct correlations with PSS for these behaviors are generally weak or mixed.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite the physiological markers of elevated arousal (high Mesor and RHR) and lower self-reported happiness, the weight of evidence strongly suggests that the participant's subjective experience of stress is relatively low. The self-reported psychological measures (CESD, STAI, PSQI) are direct assessments of mental well-being and distress, and their exceptionally low scores are highly indicative of a lower perceived stress level. Furthermore, the objective sleep data, characterized by long duration, and the robust, stable circadian rhythms (low Intradaily Variability, high Amplitude) provide a strong foundation for overall physiological and psychological resilience, which likely moderates the impact of potential stressors. While the elevated physiological arousal and certain behavioral patterns warrant attention, they do not override the consistent subjective reports of low psychological distress and good sleep. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's PSS score falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

48969,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a notably challenging psychological profile characterized by elevated depressive and anxious symptoms. Their CES-D score of 42.0 (Z-score = 2.99) is significantly above the population mean, classifying them as depressed, a psychological state that demonstrates a strong positive correlation with perceived stress (r=0.29). Similarly, their STAI-Trait score of 59.0 (Z-score = 1.75) indicates a high level of chronic anxiety, which is also positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.31). These prominent symptoms of distress are further compounded by a markedly low self-esteem, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 22.0 (Z-score = -2.28), a factor negatively correlated with perceived stress (r=-0.15). Consistent with these findings, self-reported happiness is low (score 2.0, Z-score = -1.61), which is also negatively correlated with perceived stress (r=-0.19). While health satisfaction is slightly above average (score 5.33, Z-score = 0.8), this finding appears to be an outlier amidst a strong and consistent constellation of adverse mental health indicators.

Despite achieving an objectively above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score = 0.84), the participant reports severely disturbed subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 13.0 (Z-score = 2.90). This places them firmly in the ""Disturbed Sleep"" category, suggesting that while total sleep time may be adequate, the subjective experience of sleep is poor, likely due to fragmentation or other qualitative difficulties not captured by duration alone. The consistency of sleep onset (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.01) is average, suggesting a somewhat regular schedule, yet sleep duration variability is slightly elevated (116 minutes, Z-score = 0.33), which shows a positive correlation with perceived stress (r=0.14). The significant discrepancy between objective sleep duration and subjective sleep quality, coupled with the high PSQI score, points towards sleep as a considerable area of distress.

Physiological data indicate an elevated baseline level of cardiovascular arousal. The participant’s resting heart rate of 68.55 BPM (Z-score = 1.24) is notably above the population average and positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.14). The average heart rate over the 24-hour cycle (Mesor = 79.76, Z-score = 0.79) is also on the higher side, suggesting a generally elevated physiological state. The heart rate-based circadian rhythm demonstrates average interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.08) and intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.32), alongside an above-average autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.98), suggesting a generally stable and predictable rhythm. However, the rhythm’s amplitude (9.62, Z-score = -0.38) is slightly below average, potentially indicating less pronounced physiological swings between periods of activity and rest. The acrophase occurs relatively late in the day at 5:06 PM, suggesting a peak in cardiovascular activity later than typically observed in a standard diurnal pattern. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show the expected pattern of lower rates during sleep and higher rates during daytime activity, with peaks predominantly in the early to late afternoon, consistent with the observed acrophase. The combination of an elevated resting heart rate and mesor, along with a somewhat blunted amplitude, may reflect a state of persistent physiological activation or a less efficient return to baseline, thereby contributing to overall perceived stress.

The participant exhibits a pattern of predominantly solitary and sedentary recreational habits. While engaging in above-average solitary exercise (Z-score = 1.07), there is a marked absence of social exercise (Z-score = -1.58) and sports participation (Z-score = -0.42). Daily recreation is heavily dominated by screen-based activities, with extremely high engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 3.17), video games (Z-score = 4.74), and internet usage (Z-score = 2.19), each exceeding four hours daily. In stark contrast, social engagement is remarkably low, with socializing with friends occurring 15 minutes or less daily (Z-score = -2.20). This significantly reduced social interaction is a factor known to exacerbate feelings of isolation and stress. The minimal engagement in reading and other sedentary hobbies, despite extensive screen time, further highlights a focused pattern of digital consumption. This behavioral pattern of high screen time and significantly limited social interaction suggests a potentially isolating lifestyle, where digital engagement might serve as a primary coping mechanism or distraction rather than a source of genuine connection or stress reduction.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence for a high Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score (top 50th percentile) is substantial and pervasive across multiple data modalities. The participant presents with highly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z=2.99) and anxious trait levels (STAI Z=1.75), both of which are strongly positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, very low self-esteem (Z=-2.28) and low self-reported happiness (Z=-1.61) further support a profile of significant psychological distress, as these factors are negatively correlated with PSS. Sleep quality is severely disturbed (PSQI Z=2.90), which is a common correlate of heightened stress. Physiologically, an elevated resting heart rate (Z=1.24) and higher average heart rate (Mesor Z=0.79) suggest chronic physiological arousal, often indicative of chronic stress. Behaviorally, extremely low levels of social interaction (Socializing with Friends Z=-2.20) point towards social isolation, a well-established risk factor for increased stress.

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is comparatively weak and often contextualized by other, more dominant stressors. The participant exhibits low substance usage and engages in above-average solitary exercise (Z=1.07), which are generally considered positive coping mechanisms or health behaviors. Objectively, median sleep duration is above average (Z=0.84), and circadian rhythm stability and autocorrelation are average to above average. Health satisfaction is also slightly above average. However, the benefits of these factors appear to be largely outweighed or undermined by the severe psychological distress and poor subjective sleep quality. For instance, while objective sleep duration is adequate, the subjective experience of sleep is profoundly poor, as captured by the PSQI. The positive coping mechanism of solitary exercise, while present, does not appear sufficient to mitigate the pervasive psychological and physiological indicators of stress.

Based on a holistic analysis, the overwhelming confluence of significantly elevated depressive and anxious symptoms, severely disturbed subjective sleep, low self-esteem and happiness, elevated physiological arousal, and profound social isolation strongly indicates that this participant experiences a high level of perceived stress. These factors, many of which are highly correlated with PSS scores, collectively paint a picture of an individual under considerable psychological and physiological strain. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

79731,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile reveals several salient indicators of heightened psychological distress. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, are elevated (Score: 27.0, Z-score: 1.42), classifying the participant as 'Depressed' and demonstrating a positive correlation (0.28) with perceived stress. Furthermore, the STAI–Trait score (60.0, Z-score: 1.85) indicates markedly elevated chronic anxiety, classified as 'anxious,' with a strong positive correlation (0.31) to perceived stress. This individual also reports lower self-esteem (Score: 29.0, Z-Score: -1.29) and significantly reduced satisfaction with physical health (Score: 2.22, Z-score: -1.53), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that lower self-esteem and health satisfaction are associated with higher perceived stress. While self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Score: 4.0, Z-Score: 0.55), its negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.19) implies that higher happiness is generally associated with lower stress, potentially indicating a complex interplay with the other pronounced mental health indicators.

Sleep patterns present a complex picture of disturbance. Subjectively, the participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, with a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z-Score: 1.98), placing them significantly above the population mean for poor sleep quality. Objectively, wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 17 minutes (Z-Score: 1.37), which is longer than average. However, this extended duration is accompanied by very high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 177 minutes, Z-Score: 1.73), suggesting inconsistent sleep habits, which positively correlates with perceived stress. The participant also reports a higher frequency of napping (Mean Daily Naps: 0.19, Z-Score: 1.34), which is also positively correlated with perceived stress. Despite a relatively consistent sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 53 minutes, Z-Score: -0.66), the overall pattern points to quantity of sleep without quality, characterized by significant inconsistency and subjective dissatisfaction.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits several markers suggestive of elevated basal arousal and altered circadian regulation. Their resting heart rate (71.2 bpm, Z-Score: 1.55) is significantly above the population average, correlating positively (0.14) with perceived stress. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 79.9, Z-Score: 0.81) is also higher than average. The heart rate-based circadian rhythm shows a lower-than-average amplitude (7.09, Z-Score: -1.19), suggesting a blunted physiological response between active and rest phases, which negatively correlates with perceived stress. There is also higher intradaily variability (0.64, Z-Score: 0.67), indicating more erratic fluctuations in heart rate within a day, correlating positively (0.16) with perceived stress. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals typical nocturnal decreases, but the positive Z-scores during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-4 AM Z=1.61, 4-5 AM Z=1.78) suggest that even during periods of lowest physiological activity, the heart rate remains relatively high compared to the population at those times. Daytime peaks in heart rate, particularly in the evening (e.g., 9-10 PM: 9.84 bpm above mesor), align with an Acrophase of 6:27 PM, but many of the afternoon/evening positive deviations exhibit negative Z-scores (e.g., 6-7 PM Z=-1.21), suggesting that while activity heart rates are elevated, the *peak magnitude* relative to the population might be less pronounced, consistent with the observed lower amplitude and overall dampened rhythm.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates an extremely low engagement in physical activity, reporting 'Not at all' for exercising alone (Z-Score: -1.93), exercising with others (Z-Score: -1.58), and sports (Z-Score: -1.09). This significant lack of exercise is a notable absence of a common stress-buffering behavior. Substance usage patterns are moderate and within normative ranges, with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits involve substantial internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-Score: 0.85) and listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-Score: 1.6), indicative of a largely sedentary lifestyle. Academically, the participant experienced a notable decline in GPA from Fall 2015 (3.43) to Spring 2016 (2.62), suggesting potential academic stressors during the study period. The participant's Body Mass Index of 29.86 is also near the threshold for obesity, indicating a potential physical health consideration.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50% of the study population distribution) is substantial across multiple domains. The participant exhibits significantly elevated self-reported anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.85) and depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: 1.42), both of which are positively correlated with PSS. Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI Z-score: 1.98), a strong indicator of stress. Physiologically, a highly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.55) and an increased standard deviation in objective sleep duration (Z-score: 1.73), coupled with diminished circadian amplitude (Z-score: -1.19) and increased intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score: 0.67), point towards a state of chronic physiological arousal and dysregulation often associated with high stress. Behavioral patterns, specifically the complete lack of physical exercise (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score: -1.93), remove a key coping mechanism for stress. Additionally, low self-esteem (Z-score: -1.29) and low health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.53), both negatively correlated with PSS, further suggest an elevated stress experience. The decline in academic performance (GPA) also aligns with potential stress-related challenges.

Evidence that might suggest a low or median PSS score (bottom 50% of the study population distribution) is comparatively weak. While objective sleep duration is longer than average (Z-score: 1.37), this is largely contradicted by the significant subjective sleep disturbance and high variability in sleep duration, suggesting ineffective or compensatory sleep rather than restorative sleep associated with lower stress. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average, but its negative correlation with PSS means higher happiness is typically linked to lower stress, and this singular positive indicator is overshadowed by the other pronounced mental health symptoms. Similarly, moderate substance use and relatively consistent sleep start times do not strongly mitigate the extensive evidence for high stress.

Based on a holistic analysis, the overwhelming majority of indicators from self-report surveys, physiological markers, and behavioral data consistently point towards a participant experiencing significantly elevated perceived stress. The high scores for anxiety, depressive symptoms, and subjective sleep disturbance, coupled with a high resting heart rate, disrupted physiological rhythms, and an absence of stress-buffering behaviors like exercise, form a cohesive pattern indicative of high perceived stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant’s PSS score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

64296,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant presents a robust psychological profile characterized by low self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Their CES-D score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.07) indicates a negligible burden of depressive symptoms, correlating positively with PSS, suggesting that lower depressive symptoms are associated with lower perceived stress. Similarly, a STAI-Trait score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.62) classifies them as 'not anxious', with its positive correlation implying that lower trait anxiety is linked to reduced perceived stress. Further reinforcing this positive disposition are a high self-esteem score of 45.0 (Z-score 0.96) and a very high self-reported happiness score of 5.0 (Z-score 1.64), both of which correlate negatively with PSS, indicating their association with lower perceived stress. Academically, the participant demonstrates strong and improving performance, with a GPA of 3.93 in the most recent semester. These indicators collectively suggest a resilient psychological state, capable of effectively managing typical academic stressors.

Sleep patterns and quality, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, are largely favorable, characterized by consistency despite a slightly shorter median duration. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8) indicates 'Good Sleep', falling below the clinical threshold for sleep disturbance and better than the population average. Fitbit data corroborates this with a median sleep duration of 6 hours 52 minutes (Z-score -0.4), which, while slightly below the population median, is highly consistent, as evidenced by a low sleep duration standard deviation of 42 minutes (Z-score -1.33). Sleep start times are also notably consistent, with a standard deviation of 50 minutes (Z-score -0.72), though the median start time of 01:07:30 AM is relatively late. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) suggests consolidated nighttime sleep. The correlations between lower PSS and both longer sleep duration and less variability in sleep duration/start time highlight the beneficial effect of the participant's sleep consistency on perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveal a remarkably stable and well-regulated circadian rhythm, indicative of strong homeostatic control. The participant exhibits high Interdaily Stability (0.58, Z-score 1.41) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (0.48, Z-score 1.32), alongside slightly below-average Intradaily Variability (0.51, Z-score -0.25). These measures collectively reflect a highly regular and predictable daily pattern in heart rate. A particularly salient feature is the very high heart rate Amplitude (19.12, Z-score 2.7), which indicates a pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rate values, signifying a robust physiological response to daily demands and effective recovery during rest. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above average (76.46, Z-score 0.34), and the acrophase (peak heart rate) occurs at 4:23 PM. Furthermore, the resting heart rate of 49.8 bpm (Z-score -0.99) is significantly below the population average, suggesting excellent cardiovascular fitness. Hourly deviations from the mesor show deep physiological rest during the early morning hours (e.g., -34.27 at 4-5 am) followed by substantial increases during the day, peaking between 10-11 am and 4-5 pm (e.g., +23.24 at 4-5 pm), illustrating a clear and healthy diurnal pattern of physiological arousal. These strong circadian and cardiovascular indicators, which largely correlate negatively with PSS, are consistent with lower perceived stress.

The participant's lifestyle and behavioral habits are generally healthy, though some areas indicate limited engagement. Substance use is notably absent across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), placing the participant well below average for all corresponding Z-scores. Exercise habits show moderate engagement in 'Exercised with Others' (1-2 times a week, Z-Score 0.53), but very low engagement in 'Exercised Alone' and 'Sports' (both 'Not at all', with low Z-scores). Daily recreational habits largely indicate low engagement, with 'Watching TV/Videos/Movies', 'Internet Usage', 'Listening to Music', 'Socializing with Friends', and 'Reading' all reported at or below 15-30 minutes, resulting in generally low Z-scores. However, the participant reports above-average time spent on a 'Sedentary Hobby' (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score 0.82). An area that stands out is below-average health satisfaction (Score 3.22, Z-score -0.78), which correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting that lower satisfaction might be associated with higher perceived stress. While most lifestyle choices align with a low-stress profile, this specific metric may indicate an underlying concern.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The overwhelming majority of the participant's data points toward a profile consistent with low to average perceived stress, placing them in the bottom 50% of the study population.
*   **Psychological Well-being:** The participant reports significantly low depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62). Both metrics correlate positively with PSS, meaning lower scores are associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and happiness (Z-score 1.64) are present, with both correlating negatively with PSS, further indicating lower stress.
*   **Physiological Regulation:** The participant exhibits an exceptionally strong and stable circadian rhythm, marked by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.41), high Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.32), and a very high Amplitude (Z-score 2.7). All these features correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting superior physiological resilience. Their resting heart rate (49.8 bpm, Z-score -0.99) is notably low, indicating excellent cardiovascular fitness and correlating positively with PSS, implying a lower RHR is associated with lower stress. The robust diurnal pattern of heart rate with deep nocturnal recovery also supports this.
*   **Sleep Quality and Consistency:** Self-reported PSQI score (Z-score -0.8) indicates good sleep quality, and wearable data shows remarkable consistency in sleep duration (Z-score -1.33) and start times (Z-score -0.72). While median sleep duration is slightly below average, the consistency is a strong positive factor, as consistency in sleep metrics correlates negatively with PSS.
*   **Healthy Habits:** The complete absence of substance use across all categories is a significant protective factor against stress. Strong academic performance, as evidenced by improving GPA, suggests effective management of academic demands.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a higher perceived stress level is considerably less prevalent and generally milder in magnitude compared to the indicators for low stress.
*   **Health Satisfaction:** The participant reports below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78). Given its negative correlation with PSS, lower satisfaction in this domain could be associated with slightly elevated perceived stress.
*   **Sleep Duration:** Median sleep duration is slightly below average (Z-score -0.4). While not critically low, the negative correlation with PSS suggests shorter sleep durations could be associated with somewhat higher stress.
*   **Recreational Engagement:** The participant shows relatively low engagement in some recreational activities and individual exercise. While not directly correlated with PSS for individual items, a general lack of diverse leisure activities might, for some individuals, contribute to accumulated stress. However, this is speculative and contradicted by strong positive indicators.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the participant demonstrates a profile overwhelmingly indicative of low perceived stress. The psychological indicators of low anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high happiness are exceptionally strong and are corroborated by robust physiological markers of circadian rhythm stability, high heart rate amplitude, and excellent cardiovascular fitness (low resting heart rate). Sleep, though slightly shorter than average, is notably consistent and subjectively good. The few points that might suggest higher stress, such as below-average health satisfaction and slightly shorter sleep duration, are relatively minor in comparison to the quantity and strength of the evidence supporting a lower stress profile. Therefore, based on the comprehensive evidence, the participant's overall perceived stress level is most likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

17569,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant exhibits a nuanced profile characterized by robust psychological resilience in core trait measures, coupled with objective indicators of physiological regulation, yet with significant challenges in sleep quality and academic performance. Psychologically, the participant reports levels of depressive symptoms (CESD score 11.0, Z-score -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI score 38.0, Z-score -0.33) that are below the study population average, classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" This is further supported by a notably high self-esteem score (RSES score 43.0, Z-score 0.68) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Score 5.78, Z-score 1.13), indicating a strong sense of self-worth and well-being. Additionally, the participant demonstrates a high degree of trust in others (Score 3.83, Z-score 1.15). While current self-reported happiness (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) is slightly below the population mean, the overall self-reported psychological and social attributes suggest a resilient individual.

Behaviorally, a primary area of concern lies in sleep. Despite regular sleep initiation times (Standard Deviation of 32 minutes, Z-score -1.12), the participant's median sleep duration is critically short at 5 hours 44 minutes (Z-score -1.81), significantly below the population average. This objective measure is corroborated by a self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59), which classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This chronic sleep deprivation is a significant physiological and behavioral stressor, even if the individual maintains consistency in their inadequate sleep schedule. Regarding other habits, alcohol consumption is above average for beer (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01), but other substance use is absent. Exercise habits are mixed, with very low engagement in exercising alone but moderate participation in exercising with others (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.53). Daily recreational screen time and sedentary hobbies are notably low, suggesting a preference for non-digital or non-sedentary leisure, which typically aligns with active lifestyles. However, the participant's GPA has shown a concerning decline across recent academic semesters, which may indicate increasing academic pressure or other challenges.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits several robust markers. Their resting heart rate is remarkably low at 47.0 bpm (Z-score -1.33), suggesting high cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis reveals above-average interdaily stability (0.55, Z-score 1.16), indicating high regularity in daily heart rate patterns across days, and a robust heart rate amplitude (13.6, Z-score 0.91), signifying strong diurnal variation. The overall mean heart rate (MESOR 69.16, Z-score -0.65) is slightly below average. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a clear and pronounced nocturnal decrease in heart rate, with values dropping significantly below the resting heart rate during 2-6 AM (e.g., -29.99 deviation at 4-5 AM, translating to an actual HR of approximately 39.17 bpm), suggesting deep physiological rest. Conversely, there are distinct peaks of physiological arousal during typical daytime hours, particularly in the late morning (9-10 AM, +19.56 deviation from mesor, approx. 88.72 bpm) and early afternoon (1-2 PM, +16.76 deviation, approx. 85.92 bpm), which are well above the resting heart rate, reflecting engagement in daily activities. This pattern of a robust nocturnal HR dip followed by clear diurnal peaks points to a well-structured and responsive autonomic nervous system, despite the reported sleep insufficiency.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**

A substantial body of evidence suggests that the participant's perceived stress level is likely in the bottom half of the study population. Self-report measures indicate significantly lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.24, positive correlation with PSS: 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33, positive correlation with PSS: 0.31). These core psychological resilience factors are strongly associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits high self-esteem (Z-score 0.68, negative correlation with PSS: -0.15) and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.13, negative correlation with PSS: -0.08), both of which are protective factors against perceived stress. Physiologically, a very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.33, positive correlation with PSS: 0.14) and high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.16, negative correlation with PSS: -0.12) and heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.91, negative correlation with PSS: -0.17) indicate robust physiological regulation and consistent daily rhythms, typically associated with lower stress levels. The high regularity in sleep start times (Z-score -1.12 for SD, positive correlation with PSS: 0.18) also aligns with a more organized lifestyle that could mitigate perceived stress. Engagement in exercise with others and low screen time further contribute to this picture.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**

Conversely, there are notable factors that could contribute to an elevated perceived stress level. The most prominent is the severe sleep deprivation, with a median sleep duration of only 5 hours 44 minutes (Z-score -1.81). This is compounded by a self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification via the PSQI (score 8, Z-score 0.59). Chronic insufficient sleep is a significant physiological and psychological stressor, regardless of correlations. Additionally, the participant's current happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53, negative correlation with PSS: -0.19), suggesting a potentially diminished affective state that could be linked to higher stress. The declining trend in GPA over recent semesters points to potential academic pressures that could significantly contribute to perceived stress in a university student population. While not extremely high, the intradaily variability (IV Z-score 0.46) is slightly above average and positively correlated with PSS (0.16), suggesting some fragmentation in physiological patterns that could be stress-related.

**Holistic Analysis:**

Weighing the evidence, the participant's profile strongly suggests a perceived stress level in the **bottom 50th percentile** of the study population. The numerous and robust indicators of psychological well-being (low anxiety/depression, high self-esteem, high health satisfaction) and physiological regulation (very low RHR, high interdaily stability, robust heart rate amplitude) are powerful counter-indicators to high perceived stress. These factors, many of which show significant Z-scores and correlations indicative of lower PSS, suggest strong internal resources for coping with challenges. While the severe sleep deprivation and declining GPA are significant stressors that would typically elevate perceived stress, the participant's overall resilience and well-regulated physiological systems imply that they may be perceiving and managing these challenges without a globally elevated sense of stress compared to their peers. It is possible they are highly adapted to a demanding academic schedule, or their strong psychological traits buffer the impact of these stressors on their *perceived* stress levels. The correlations for happiness and IV, while pointing to higher PSS, are less extreme in magnitude compared to the protective factors.

77036,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"This analysis interprets the provided multimodal data to develop an understanding of the participant’s psychological state and behavioral patterns, with a specific focus on evaluating perceived stress levels. The interpretation considers self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological metrics, using Z-scores to contextualize individual values against the study population and correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to infer potential relationships.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a nuanced picture. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, are below the population average (Z-score: -0.55), classifying the participant as ""Not depressed."" This lower level of depressive symptomatology is positively correlated with PSS (0.28), suggesting that fewer depressive symptoms generally coincide with lower perceived stress. Conversely, trait anxiety, measured by the STAI scale, is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.17) and is classified as ""anxious,"" with a positive correlation of 0.31 with PSS. This suggests a slightly higher baseline propensity for anxiety, which may contribute to perceived stress. Self-esteem is average (Z-score: -0.03), showing a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.15). The participant reports higher-than-average happiness (Z-score: 0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.19), generally indicating lower stress. However, health satisfaction is lower than the population average (Z-score: -0.53), although its correlation with PSS is weak (-0.08). Lifestyle behaviors show low engagement in substance use, with Z-scores well below average across all categories (e.g., Wine or Liquor Z-score: -1.3). Exercise patterns are varied; while individual and group exercise frequencies are low, engagement in sports is higher than average (Z-score: 0.91). Most daily recreational activities, such as watching TV, listening to music, and socializing, show significantly lower engagement than the population average, with corresponding Z-scores ranging from -0.56 to -1.41. The lack of engagement in activities like reading, which has a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), could suggest a missed opportunity for stress reduction.

Objective sleep statistics from wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.41). However, the participant demonstrates greater consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score: -0.77) and sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score: -0.55) compared to the population, suggesting a more regular sleep schedule. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score: 6.0), yet the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates subjective sleep quality is *better* than the average for the study population. Given the moderate positive correlation between PSQI and PSS (0.33), this relatively better subjective sleep quality is likely associated with lower perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate measurements reveal exceptionally stable and regular circadian rhythms. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is remarkably high (Z-score: 2.49), indicating a very strong and consistent daily pattern in heart rate. This metric shows a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.18), suggesting that this robust rhythmicity may be linked to lower perceived stress. Interdaily stability is also higher than average (Z-score: 1.0), implying consistent day-to-day physiological routines, with a weak negative correlation to PSS (-0.12). Intradaily variability is significantly lower than average (Z-score: -1.31), reflecting a less fragmented heart rate pattern within the day. The participant's resting heart rate of 61.2 bpm is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.36), and the overall mesor (average heart rate) is also slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.62), potentially indicating a somewhat higher baseline physiological arousal. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest heart rates occurring during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -20.92 at 4-5 AM) and peak activity observed in the late afternoon (e.g., +10.58 at 5-6 PM). The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, is at 4:14 PM, which aligns with expected physiological rhythms. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is average (Z-score: 0.04), while the high stability metrics suggest a well-entrained circadian system.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant’s overall perceived stress level likely falls into the top or bottom half of the study population, a holistic evaluation of the evidence is necessary.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
*   **Lower Depressive Symptoms (CESD):** The participant's CESD Z-score of -0.55 indicates significantly fewer depressive symptoms than the population average. Given the positive correlation of CESD with PSS (0.28), this strongly suggests lower perceived stress.
*   **Better Subjective Sleep Quality (PSQI):** Despite a ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, the PSQI Z-score of -0.33 shows subjective sleep quality that is better than the population average. The positive correlation of PSQI with PSS (0.33) means this is a strong indicator for lower perceived stress.
*   **High Happiness:** A Z-score of 0.55 indicates higher self-reported happiness, which generally corresponds to lower stress levels (PSS correlation: -0.19).
*   **Exceptional Circadian Rhythm Regularity:** The most striking evidence comes from the wearable data, particularly the exceptionally high Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: 2.49) and higher Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 1.0), which both suggest a highly stable and consistent physiological rhythm. These metrics are generally associated with better health and adaptability, and Autocorrelation has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.18). Furthermore, significantly lower Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -1.31) points to less fragmented daily physiological patterns.
*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** More consistent sleep duration and start times than the population average (negative Z-scores for standard deviations), which typically contributes to better overall well-being.
*   **Low Substance Usage:** Consistently lower than average usage across various substances suggests healthier coping mechanisms or less reliance on external substances, which might indirectly contribute to lower stress.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI):** The participant’s STAI Z-score of 0.17, classifying them as ""anxious,"" indicates a slightly higher baseline anxiety proneness that positively correlates with PSS (0.31).
*   **Slightly Elevated Resting Heart Rate and Mesor:** The resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.36) and overall mesor (Z-score: 0.62) are slightly above average, which could reflect a mild state of physiological arousal, though correlations with PSS are weak.
*   **Low Health Satisfaction:** Lower-than-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: -0.53) could be a minor contributor to stress, though its PSS correlation is very weak.
*   **Limited Engagement in Certain Recreational Activities:** Specifically, the very low engagement in reading (Z-score: -0.67), which has a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), suggests that the absence of this activity might be associated with higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are indicators suggesting slightly elevated anxiety and physiological arousal, the predominant and more salient evidence points towards lower perceived stress. The exceptionally strong circadian rhythm regularity, as evidenced by the high Z-scores for Autocorrelation at 24 hours, Interdaily Stability, and low Intradaily Variability, is a robust physiological marker often associated with resilience and well-being. Coupled with significantly lower depressive symptoms, better-than-average subjective sleep quality, and higher happiness, these factors collectively outweigh the more modest indicators of higher stress. The PSS correlations for these ""lower stress"" indicators (CESD: 0.28, PSQI: 0.33, Autocorrelation: -0.18) are generally stronger and align with Z-scores that strongly favor a healthier profile. Therefore, based on the integrated assessment of self-reported psychological states and objective physiological and behavioral metrics, the participant is most likely to have a PSS score in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

82986,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

**Psychological Well-being and Self-Perception:**
The participant's self-reported psychological well-being generally presents a robust profile, with several key metrics suggesting resilience against elevated stress. Specifically, scores on the CES-D (Z-score: -0.97) and STAI-Trait scale (Z-score: -1.61) are both significantly below the population mean, indicating fewer depressive symptoms and lower chronic anxiety proneness. These measures exhibit positive correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), meaning lower scores are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports substantially higher self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66) and happiness (Z-score: 1.64) compared to the study population, both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting these are protective factors. Health satisfaction is also reported above average (Z-score: 0.80), further contributing to a positive self-perception and being negatively correlated with PSS. The participant also reports high trust in others (Z-score: 1.79), a factor with a very weak negative correlation with PSS. These collective self-reported psychological strengths indicate a generally positive internal state and strong self-concept.

**Academic Performance and Lifestyle Habits:**
Academic performance shows a concerning trend, with a notable decline in GPA across semesters (from 3.4 in Fall 2015 to 2.41 in Fall 2016). While the direct correlation with PSS is not provided, this academic trajectory could represent a significant source of academic pressure or reflect underlying challenges that could influence perceived stress. In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates healthy habits regarding substance use, reporting no usage of alcohol (beer, wine/liquor), recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are moderate, with individual exercise occurring 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32), which is near the population mean, but infrequent social exercise (1-2 times a month, Z-score: -0.17) and no participation in sports (Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreational habits indicate relatively low engagement in passive leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, and reading, all with negative Z-scores. Internet usage is reported as 31 minutes per hour (Z-score: -0.49), and socializing with friends for 1-2 hours a day (Z-score: 0.16). While the lack of substance use is a positive health indicator, the limited engagement in diverse leisure activities, particularly reading (which shows a negative correlation with PSS), might suggest a restricted repertoire of stress-coping strategies or a lack of engagement in restorative activities.

**Sleep Patterns and Quality:**
Both self-reported and objective wearable data converge to indicate severe and persistent sleep disturbances. The participant reports clinically significant poor sleep quality on the PSQI (Score: 6.0, Z-score: -0.33), with scores above 5 commonly indicating sleep disturbance. This subjective experience is strongly corroborated by Fitbit-recorded data showing an exceptionally short median sleep duration of 5 hours 6 minutes (Z-score: -2.60), which is profoundly below the population average. This metric is negatively correlated with PSS, signifying that shorter sleep duration is associated with higher perceived stress. Although the variability in sleep duration (68 minutes, Z-score: -0.75) and sleep start time (61 minutes, Z-score: -0.48) are both below the population mean, suggesting a relatively consistent (albeit late and insufficient) sleep schedule, the critical issue remains the severe overall sleep deprivation. The participant reports no daily napping (Z-score: -0.86). The combination of self-reported poor sleep quality and objectively measured extreme sleep restriction presents a significant physiological and behavioral stressor.

**Physiological Arousal and Circadian Rhythms:**
Physiological data derived from the wearable device reveal patterns consistent with elevated physiological arousal and some circadian dysregulation. The participant's resting heart rate of 66.8 bpm is above the population mean (Z-score: 1.03) and is positively correlated with PSS, indicating a higher baseline level of cardiovascular activity. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is also above average (Z-score: 0.79). Analysis of the circadian rhythm metrics indicates a slightly less stable daily rhythm (Interdaily Stability: 0.33, Z-score: -0.66) and a weaker 24-hour autocorrelation (0.27, Z-score: -0.45). Both of these metrics are negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting that less robust rhythmic patterns are associated with higher perceived stress. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.46), which is positively correlated with PSS, implying a degree of fragmentation in within-day heart rate patterns. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is below average (Z-score: -1.04), indicating a less pronounced daily swing in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak heart rate time, is relatively late in the day at 4:37 PM.
Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a distinctive daily profile. During the deep sleep period (approximately 3-6 AM), while heart rates are below the mesor, these dips are less pronounced than typical for the population (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-score: 0.42, 5-6 AM Z-score: 0.18), suggesting a relatively higher physiological state even during the deepest nocturnal phase. In contrast, morning hours (7-9 AM) show a sharp and pronounced increase in heart rate above the mesor, with highly positive Z-scores (7-8 AM Z-score: 1.51, 8-9 AM Z-score: 1.32). These elevated morning heart rates, in conjunction with the higher resting heart rate, suggest a pattern of sustained physiological activation throughout the waking day, particularly in the mornings, which is positively correlated with PSS for many of these hours. This combination of chronic physiological arousal, especially morning hyperarousal, and a less stable or dampened circadian rhythm likely contributes to an increased perception of stress.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits significant strengths in self-reported psychological well-being, which are generally indicative of lower perceived stress. Scores for depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score: -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.61) are both substantially below the population mean, and their positive correlation with PSS suggests a protective effect against stress. Additionally, high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66) and happiness (Z-score: 1.64), both negatively correlated with PSS, further support a resilient psychological state. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score: 0.80) and negatively correlated with PSS. The complete absence of substance use is a positive health behavior, aligning with an overall healthy lifestyle that typically corresponds to lower stress. While sleep duration and start time variability are below average, indicating a consistent schedule, the overall severe sleep deprivation counteracts this consistency.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, compelling evidence suggests the participant likely experiences elevated perceived stress. The most salient factor is the extreme sleep deprivation, with a median sleep duration of only 5 hours 6 minutes (Z-score: -2.60), which is critically low and negatively correlated with PSS. This is coupled with self-reported clinically disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score: 6.0, Z-score: -0.33). Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is above average (Z-score: 1.03) and positively correlated with PSS, indicating a higher baseline arousal. Hourly heart rate data show a pattern of elevated morning activation, with significant deviations from the mesor (e.g., 7-8 AM Z-score: 1.51, 8-9 AM Z-score: 1.32), positively correlating with PSS. Circadian rhythm metrics further point to dysregulation, with a lower amplitude (Z-score: -1.04), lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.66), and weaker 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.45). These metrics are negatively correlated with PSS, meaning their lower values in this participant suggest higher stress. The declining academic GPA, while not directly correlated, presents a potential significant academic stressor. The slightly higher intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.46) and its positive correlation with PSS further contribute to this evidence.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits notable strengths in self-reported psychological well-being, evidenced by low anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and happiness, these positive traits are largely overshadowed by profound physiological and behavioral indicators of stress. The severity of the objective sleep deprivation (Z-score: -2.60), coupled with self-reported poor sleep quality, is a critical and overwhelming stressor. Chronic insufficient sleep can severely impact emotional regulation, cognitive function, and overall well-being, irrespective of underlying psychological resilience. This severe sleep deficit is further reinforced by consistent physiological data indicating elevated baseline arousal (high resting heart rate) and distinct patterns of hyperarousal during the day, particularly in the mornings. The observed irregularities in circadian rhythmicity (lower amplitude, stability, and autocorrelation) also align with a state of physiological strain. Given the direct and significant correlations between these physiological and sleep metrics and PSS, the accumulated evidence points strongly towards an individual experiencing substantial underlying stress, despite their self-reported psychological strengths. The magnitude of the sleep and physiological dysregulation suggests that the participant's perceived stress is likely to be elevated.

Based on this holistic analysis, particularly the severe and objective sleep deprivation and consistent physiological indicators of chronic arousal, it is highly probable that the participant’s overall perceived stress level (PSS score) would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

11402,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile reveals notable characteristics indicative of heightened psychological vulnerability. Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI) is significantly elevated with a score of 54, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.25, placing the individual well above the population mean for chronic anxiety. This finding is reinforced by elevated depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 17 (Z-score 0.38). Both STAI and CES-D scores exhibit moderate positive correlations with perceived stress (0.31 and 0.28, respectively), suggesting these traits are relevant to the participant's overall stress experience. Additionally, self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.53) are below the population average, further aligning with a pattern of reduced well-being. Conversely, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and high trust in others (Z-score 1.15), although these factors have weak or negligible correlations with perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics point to a state of elevated cardiovascular activity and an atypical circadian rhythm. The participant's average heart rate (Mesor) is 83.48 bpm (Z-score 1.3), and resting heart rate is 63.4 bpm (Z-score 0.62), both significantly higher than the study population average. These elevated heart rate metrics are moderately correlated with perceived stress (0.06 for Mesor, 0.14 for RHR). Circadian rhythm analysis indicates lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.03), and notably low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.45), suggesting a less robust and less consistent daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, is observed late in the evening at 6:58 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further illustrate this pattern, with heart rate remaining elevated above the mesor well into the early morning hours (e.g., +5.92 and +4.74 bpm above mesor between 12-2 AM) and peaking significantly at 7-8 PM (17.2 bpm above mesor, reflecting an average HR over 100 bpm), which aligns with the late acrophase. This sustained elevation in heart rate during typical resting periods and the delayed peak in activity suggest a pattern of prolonged physiological arousal.

Objective sleep statistics reveal significant dysregulation despite the participant's subjective perception of ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI score 5, Z-score -0.8). The median nightly sleep duration is notably short at 6 hours 19 minutes (Z-score -1.07), falling significantly below the population average. Both sleep duration and sleep start times exhibit high variability, with standard deviations of 136 minutes (Z-score 0.8) and 135 minutes (Z-score 1.14), respectively. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is exceptionally late at 03:17:50. The participant also reports an above-average frequency of napping (Z-score 1.21). These objective sleep deficits—short duration, high variability, and a profoundly delayed and inconsistent sleep schedule—are often associated with increased stress and impaired health. The positive correlations between sleep duration variability, sleep start time variability, napping frequency, and perceived stress (0.14, 0.17, and 0.14 respectively) underscore the link between these objective sleep disruptions and perceived stress, highlighting a clear discrepancy between subjective sleep quality assessment and objective sleep architecture.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates a high engagement in sedentary recreational activities. Video game usage (Z-score 2.47) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) are significantly above the population average, with above-average internet usage as well. While these activities are not strongly correlated with perceived stress, their prominence suggests a lifestyle with considerable time spent in passive leisure. Exercise habits include 1-2 times per week of individual and group exercise, which is moderate, but no participation in sports. Alcohol consumption for beer is slightly above average (Z-score 1.01), while other substance use is reported as minimal or none. These activity patterns, particularly the high engagement in sedentary pursuits, may contribute to overall health and well-being in ways that could indirectly impact stress levels, though direct correlations are weak.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

The participant exhibits several salient indicators that strongly suggest an elevated level of perceived stress, likely placing them in the top 50% of the study population.
1.  **Elevated Psychological Vulnerabilities:** The participant's self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score 54, Z-score 1.25) is considerably high, classified as ""anxious,"" and demonstrates a moderate positive correlation with PSS (0.31). Similarly, depressive symptoms (CESD score 17, Z-score 0.38) are elevated and also moderately correlated with PSS (0.28). These significant psychological factors are well-established precursors and correlates of heightened stress.
2.  **Physiological Arousal:** The participant's Mesor (average heart rate, Z-score 1.3) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.62) are both above average. A higher RHR (moderately correlated with PSS at 0.14) is a common physiological marker of stress. The hourly heart rate data further reveal sustained elevated heart rates well past midnight and a late acrophase, indicating prolonged physiological activation inconsistent with optimal rest.
3.  **Profound Sleep Dysregulation:** Objectively, the participant's sleep architecture is highly problematic. Median sleep duration is significantly short (6 hours 19 minutes, Z-score -1.07). Both sleep duration and sleep start times are highly variable (Z-scores of 0.8 and 1.14 respectively), and critically, the median sleep start time is extremely late at 03:17:50. The high variability in sleep patterns and increased napping (Z-score 1.21) are all positively correlated with PSS (0.14-0.17) and are well-known contributors to stress and poor health. These objective indicators strongly point to a chronic state of sleep deprivation and irregularity that would undeniably contribute to higher perceived stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

1.  **Subjective Sleep Quality:** The participant's PSQI score of 5 (Z-score -0.8) classifies them as having ""Good Sleep"" subjectively. This perception could buffer their *perceived* stress related to sleep difficulties, even if objective data indicates otherwise.
2.  **Positive Self-Esteem and Trust:** Higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and significantly high trust (Z-score 1.15) are generally protective psychological factors, though their correlations with PSS in this dataset are weak or negligible (-0.15 and -0.04, respectively).
3.  **Moderate Exercise and Low Drug Use:** Engagement in exercise, even if not intensive, and abstinence from recreational and non-prescribed drugs are generally positive health behaviors that could mitigate stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**

While the participant subjectively reports good sleep quality and demonstrates some protective psychological traits like higher self-esteem and trust, the confluence of high trait anxiety, elevated depressive symptoms, clear physiological signs of chronic arousal (high Mesor, RHR, late-night HR elevation), and pervasive objective sleep dysregulation (significantly short, variable, and delayed sleep) presents a compelling case for elevated perceived stress. The objective sleep metrics, in particular, are severely compromised and show positive correlations with PSS, strongly linking them to higher stress. The discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep data suggests a potential lack of awareness regarding the severity of sleep issues, which would not negate the physiological and psychological impact of poor sleep on perceived stress. Therefore, the weight of evidence, particularly from the strongly correlated psychological traits and the consistent pattern of objective physiological and behavioral markers of dysregulation, strongly indicates that this participant's perceived stress level would fall into the top half of the study population distribution.

38610,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile characterized by notably low self-reported depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 3.0 (Z-score: -1.07), and minimal trait anxiety, evidenced by a STAI score of 28.0 (Z-score: -1.31). Concurrently, indicators of positive well-being are significantly elevated, as reflected by a self-esteem score of 50.0 (Z-score: 1.66) and a happiness score of 5.0 (Z-score: 1.64), both substantially above the study population mean. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score: 1.13), alongside a higher propensity for trust in others (Z-score: 0.83). Academic performance, indicated by consistently high GPAs (ranging from 3.6 to 3.86), suggests strong academic functioning. Lifestyle behaviors generally appear healthy, with substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) reported as very low or non-existent, aligning with typically lower stress profiles. The participant also engages in regular physical exercise, particularly in group settings (exercising with others Z-score: 1.23), a behavior commonly associated with improved mood and stress reduction. However, a notable pattern of significantly reduced engagement in various recreational activities, including watching TV/videos, video games, and especially socializing with friends (Z-score: -1.41), suggests a potentially narrower scope of leisure engagement compared to peers. Time spent reading is also below average (Z-score: -0.67), which shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, suggesting less reading is associated with higher perceived stress.

Sleep quality emerges as a significant area of concern for this participant. Self-reported sleep quality, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), indicates disturbed sleep with a score of 7.0 (Z-score: 0.13), placing it slightly above the population average for sleep difficulties. This subjective experience is strongly corroborated by objective wearable data revealing a substantially short median sleep duration of 5 hours 46 minutes (Z-score: -1.76), which is significantly below the population mean. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is notably late, at approximately 2:39 AM. While the variability in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.25) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.63) are near or slightly below average, indicating a relatively consistent, albeit short and late, sleep schedule, the consistent short sleep duration represents a significant physiological stressor. Minimal napping (Z-score: -0.08) does not appear to compensate for this substantial sleep deficit.

The participant's physiological profile, derived from aggregated heart rate data, indicates some deviations from typical circadian patterns and elevated basal arousal. The resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.14) and the Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours, Z-score: 1.14) are both notably elevated, suggesting a higher basal physiological load or sympathetic nervous system activity compared to the general population. The amplitude of the circadian heart rate rhythm is below average (Z-score: -1.15), indicating a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates, which may reflect a blunted physiological response to daily rhythms. The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:32 PM. Circadian regularity metrics show minor deviations, with slightly reduced interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.36), and slightly increased intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.32). These mild irregularities, alongside the blunted amplitude and elevated baseline heart rate, collectively point towards a physiological system that may be experiencing sustained arousal or suboptimal regulation. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal typical diurnal patterns with lower rates during early morning sleep hours and higher rates during daytime and evening wakefulness, without indicating specific atypical hourly arousal patterns beyond the elevated baseline.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50%)**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators typically associated with lower perceived stress. These include significantly low scores on self-reported measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31), both of which correlate positively with PSS, suggesting lower scores on these measures are linked to lower perceived stress. Furthermore, self-esteem (Z-score: 1.66) and happiness (Z-score: 1.64) are notably high, and both correlate negatively with PSS, strongly suggesting a lower stress experience. Health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.13) and trust (Z-score: 0.83) are also above average, with minor negative correlations to PSS. Lifestyle behaviors generally point towards lower stress, such as minimal substance use and consistent engagement in physical exercise, particularly with others (Z-score: 1.23), a habit often linked to improved mental well-being. Reduced engagement in video games and internet usage also correlates with lower PSS.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%)**
Conversely, there are several significant objective indicators that point towards elevated perceived stress. The most prominent is the severely curtailed objective sleep duration, with a median of 5 hours 46 minutes (Z-score: -1.76). This metric, despite having a weak negative correlation with PSS (-0.04), implies that shorter sleep duration is associated with higher perceived stress. Self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score: 7.0, Z-score: 0.13) also indicates disturbed sleep. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates elevated basal arousal, evidenced by a significantly high resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.14) and Mesor (Z-score: 1.14), both of which positively correlate with PSS (0.14 and 0.06 respectively). The blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score: -1.15) and minor irregularities in circadian rhythmicity (e.g., increased intradaily variability, reduced interdaily stability, reduced 24-hour autocorrelation) further suggest a physiological system under potential strain or operating suboptimally, with these metrics generally correlating with higher PSS. Behaviorally, significantly reduced socializing (Z-score: -1.41) and less reading (Z-score: -0.67) are present, with the latter showing a negative correlation with PSS, implying less reading is associated with higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**
When integrating the multimodal data, a complex and somewhat contradictory picture emerges. The participant exhibits robust psychological well-being as measured by depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness, which are strong indicators for lower perceived stress. However, these positive psychological attributes are counterbalanced by significant physiological and sleep-related stressors. The severely restricted objective sleep duration (5 hours 46 minutes), which is an extreme deviation (Z-score: -1.76), combined with objective measures of elevated basal physiological arousal (high resting heart rate and Mesor, both Z-scores of 1.14) and a blunted circadian rhythm amplitude, represent substantial physiological burdens. These objective indicators of physiological stress and chronic sleep deprivation are well-established contributors to perceived stress. While the participant's strong positive psychological traits might act as protective factors, the magnitude of the objective physiological and sleep disruptions is highly significant and directly linked to increased physiological strain and poorer health outcomes. Considering that the population PSS 50th percentile is 22.0, the profound physiological and sleep deficits, despite positive self-reported mental health, suggest that the participant is likely experiencing a higher level of perceived stress than what might be inferred solely from psychological questionnaires. The objective physiological and behavioral data, particularly severe sleep deprivation and elevated resting heart rate, strongly weigh towards an elevated PSS score.

96610,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates a generally robust psychological profile characterized by low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Self-report measures indicate a CESD score of 2.0, placing them more than one standard deviation below the population mean (Z-score = -1.18), classifying them as ""Not depressed."" Similarly, their STAI-Trait score of 25.0 (Z-score = -1.61) suggests low chronic anxiety. Complementing these observations are notably high self-esteem (Score = 50.0, Z-score = 1.66), elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64), and very high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 2.05). These combined psychological traits suggest a resilient and positive self-perception, indicating strong internal resources that typically mitigate perceived stress.

Despite these psychological strengths, the participant's sleep patterns present a potential area of concern. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score = 0.59) classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed,"" indicating subjective difficulties in sleep quality over the past month. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.37). While the median sleep start time is notably late at 01:21 AM, the consistency in sleep timing is high, with a sleep start time standard deviation of only 48 minutes (Z-score = -0.77). This suggests a regular, albeit delayed, sleep schedule, but one that is still perceived as problematic by the participant.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a highly structured and stable circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.83) and a strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = 0.73), indicating a consistent daily activity pattern. The heart rate rhythm also shows a pronounced amplitude (Z-score = 1.03), reflecting a clear distinction between peak and trough physiological activity. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:20 PM. While the overall mean heart rate (Mesor = 80.72, Z-score = 0.92) and resting heart rate (60.8, Z-score = 0.32) are slightly elevated compared to the population, the hourly deviations from the Mesor show a typical daily profile with substantial drops during sleep hours and distinct peaks during active daytime periods, particularly between 8-9 AM and 2-4 PM, suggesting periods of relatively higher physiological arousal.

Lifestyle and activity patterns are characterized by minimal engagement in substance use, with ""Not at all"" reported across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs). Exercise habits are mixed; participation in general exercise (alone or with others) is low, but engagement in sports is above average (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.91). A notable pattern is the participant's low engagement across a broad spectrum of common recreational activities. They report ""Do not do"" for watching TV/videos/movies, video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies. Internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends are also reported at relatively low frequencies. This limited range of leisure pursuits may indicate a focused daily routine or a restricted set of coping and relaxation strategies, which could indirectly influence overall well-being.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

The most compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress score comes from the participant's strong psychological well-being indicators. Their exceptionally low scores on the CESD (Z-score = -1.18) and STAI (Z-score = -1.61) suggest minimal depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.28 and r=0.31, respectively). Conversely, the participant exhibits high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.66), high self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64), and very high health satisfaction (Z-score = 2.05). These positive psychological attributes are consistently associated with lower perceived stress, with negative correlations to PSS (-0.15, -0.19, and -0.08, respectively). Furthermore, the wearable data indicates a highly stable and robust circadian rhythm, with high interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.83), strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = 0.73), and a pronounced amplitude (Z-score = 1.03). These markers of physiological regularity and rhythm strength are negatively correlated with perceived stress (r=-0.12, r=-0.17, r=-0.17), suggesting a protective effect against stress. The consistency of their late sleep start time (low standard deviation, Z-score = -0.77) also points to a predictable daily routine, which can be a buffer against stress. Minimal substance use further supports a lifestyle without common maladaptive coping mechanisms.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

Evidence suggesting a potentially higher PSS score is less pronounced. The primary indicator is the participant's self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" as measured by the PSQI (Score = 8.0, Z-score = 0.59). While a direct correlation between PSQI and PSS is not provided, poor subjective sleep quality is a well-established consequence and contributor to perceived stress. Additionally, their median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.37), which can contribute to stress and fatigue. Another contributing factor could be the observed low engagement in a variety of recreational activities. For instance, the participant reports ""Do not do"" for reading, which has a negative correlation with PSS (r=-0.21), suggesting that a lack of engagement in this activity could be associated with higher stress. The slightly elevated Mesor and Resting Heart Rate, though with low positive or negligible correlations to PSS in this study, might suggest a mild underlying physiological arousal.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

Considering the totality of the data, the overwhelming weight of evidence supports the conclusion that this participant's perceived stress level is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The strong and consistent indicators of psychological well-being—namely very low depression and anxiety, combined with high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction—are powerful protective factors against perceived stress, and their correlations with PSS consistently point to lower stress. The highly regular and robust physiological circadian rhythm, as evidenced by multiple wearable metrics, further reinforces a structured and stable daily life, which is generally antithetical to high chronic stress. While subjective sleep disturbance and limited recreational engagement are noted, these factors appear insufficient to counteract the comprehensive array of psychological strengths and physiological stability observed. The sleep disturbance might be more indicative of a delayed chronotype rather than solely stress-induced poor sleep. Therefore, the participant's overall profile suggests a relatively low or average level of perceived stress compared to their peers.

77711,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex psychological profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety and markedly lower self-esteem, alongside typical levels of depressive symptoms. Specifically, the participant's STAI score of 52.0 (Z-score: 1.06) classifies them as experiencing elevated trait anxiety, a disposition positively correlated with perceived stress (0.32). In contrast, depressive symptoms, as measured by the CESD, are within the non-depressed range (Score: 13.0, Z-score: -0.03). However, self-esteem is notably below the population average (Score: 28.0, Z-Score: -1.43), and this metric shows a negative correlation with PSS (-0.16), suggesting an association between lower self-esteem and higher perceived stress. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-Score: 0.55), while satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score: -0.62). This combination of elevated anxiety and diminished self-esteem, despite otherwise typical emotional health, suggests an internal vulnerability that could contribute to heightened perceived stress.

Sleep patterns reveal a disparity between subjective experience and objective regularity. The participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-Score: 0.13), indicating subjective sleep difficulties. Objectively, wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours 55 minutes, slightly below the population mean (Z-Score: -0.33). However, the standard deviations for both sleep duration (70 minutes, Z-Score: -0.7) and sleep start time (55 minutes, Z-Score: -0.62) are below average, suggesting a consistent, regular sleep schedule. The participant does not report taking daily naps. While the objective data indicates a relatively consistent sleep-wake rhythm, the subjective experience of disturbed sleep and a slightly shorter median duration collectively suggest that the restorative quality of sleep may be suboptimal, potentially impacting overall well-being and stress levels.

Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data indicates a generally stable physiological pattern, but with notable daily peaks. Interdaily stability (0.34, Z-Score: -0.57) is slightly below average, suggesting some variability in daily rhythms, while intradaily variability (0.51, Z-Score: -0.25) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.34, Z-Score: 0.14) are near population norms, consistent with a regular but not exceptionally rigid rhythm. The participant's mesor (68.84 bpm, Z-Score: -0.7) and amplitude (10.52, Z-Score: -0.08) are slightly below average, with the acrophase (peak heart rate) occurring at 3:28 PM. The resting heart rate is notably low (52.4 bpm, Z-Score: -0.68), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a typical diurnal fluctuation, with the lowest rates during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -20.1 bpm at 5-6 AM) and a pronounced elevation during active daytime hours. The heart rate rises sharply from 7 AM, reaching its highest deviations above the mesor between 11 AM and 3 PM (e.g., +17.81 bpm at 1-2 PM, Z-score 1.65; +15.62 bpm at 2-3 PM, Z-score 1.59), reflecting periods of elevated physiological activity or arousal that are substantially higher than the population mean for those hours.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in moderate physical activity, reporting exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-Scores: 0.32 and 0.53, respectively), which is slightly above average. Sports participation is less frequent (Z-Score: -0.42). Substance use is minimal, with infrequent alcohol consumption and no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Recreational habits lean towards passive entertainment, with significantly above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-Score: 1.28) and listening to music (Z-Score: 1.6). Conversely, the participant reports no engagement in video games or reading (Z-Scores: -0.56 and -0.67, respectively). Internet usage and socializing with friends are at typical levels. This pattern of leisure suggests a preference for less active or cognitively demanding forms of recreation.

The participant demonstrates consistent and high academic performance, maintaining a GPA between 3.88 and 4.0 across multiple semesters. This indicates strong academic capability and consistent effort, which, while positive, can also be a source of pressure or a result of significant personal investment that might contribute to overall stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**
The participant exhibits several indicators that might suggest a lower or average level of perceived stress. Their academic performance is consistently exceptional, with GPAs ranging from 3.88 to 4.0, which could reflect effective coping strategies or a low perception of academic pressure. Depressive symptoms are within the non-depressed range (CESD Z-score: -0.03), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.55). Objectively, their sleep schedule demonstrates good consistency, with below-average standard deviations for sleep duration and start time, indicating a regular sleep-wake rhythm. Physiologically, a very low resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.68) and a slightly below-average heart rate mesor (Z-score: -0.7) point to a high level of cardiovascular fitness, which is generally associated with better physiological stress regulation. Additionally, moderate engagement in exercise contributes positively to stress management.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%)**
Conversely, compelling evidence suggests the participant may experience higher levels of perceived stress. Most prominently, trait anxiety (STAI score: 52.0, Z-score: 1.06) is significantly elevated and classified as ""anxious,"" with a positive correlation (0.32) to PSS, indicating that this stable anxious disposition is associated with higher perceived stress in the population. Furthermore, self-esteem is markedly low (Z-Score: -1.43), and its negative correlation with PSS (-0.16) implies that lower self-esteem is typically associated with increased perceived stress. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI score: 7.0, Z-Score: 0.13), highlighting poor perceived sleep quality despite some objective regularity. Although sleep duration consistency is good, the median sleep duration is slightly below average, and the subjective experience of disturbed sleep can profoundly impact daily functioning and perceived stress. Physiologically, while the overall cardiovascular fitness is high, the hourly heart rate data reveals significantly elevated peaks of physiological activity during the day (e.g., Z-scores up to 1.65), potentially indicating a heightened physiological response to daily demands, which could be reflective of or contribute to stress.

**Holistic Analysis**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence for elevated perceived stress appears more salient and impactful than the indicators for lower stress. The significant elevation in trait anxiety and the markedly low self-esteem are strong psychological risk factors for higher perceived stress, as indicated by their respective correlations with PSS. While academic performance is excellent and physiological fitness is high, these strengths may not fully mitigate the internal experience of anxiety and low self-worth. The subjective experience of disturbed sleep further contributes to potential stress, despite objective sleep regularity. Given the PSS population 50th percentile is 22.0, and considering the pronounced Z-scores in critical psychological domains (STAI: +1.06, Self-Esteem: -1.43) that are associated with PSS, it is highly probable that this participant's overall perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

17020,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates an average level of trait anxiety (STAI score of 40.0, Z-score -0.13) and low-average depressive symptoms (CESD score of 10.0, Z-score -0.34), which are classified as ""Not depressed."" Self-esteem is slightly above average (Score 40.0, Z-score 0.26). However, these indicators are contrasted by lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Score 3.22, Z-score -0.78). Trust in others is close to the population average (Score 3.17, Z-score -0.14). This combination suggests a psychological state characterized by manageable trait-level symptoms but with a notable deficit in general well-being and health satisfaction.

Sleep patterns reveal a complex picture, with subjective experiences diverging from objective duration. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance (PSQI score of 7.0, Z-score 0.13, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""), despite maintaining an average median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours and 7 minutes (Z-score -0.08). Objectively, the median sleep start time is late (02:12:45), but the consistency of this start time is relatively high (standard deviation of 72 minutes, Z-score -0.23). Conversely, there is slightly greater variability in total sleep duration (standard deviation of 108 minutes, Z-score 0.17). This indicates that while the participant obtains an adequate amount of sleep on average and maintains a consistent bedtime, the overall quality of sleep is perceived as poor, and the duration itself is somewhat irregular.

Cardiovascular activity, derived from wearable data, presents a profile marked by a significantly low resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z-score -1.18) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor of 59.63 bpm, Z-score -1.95), which typically suggests good cardiovascular fitness. However, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm exhibits a significantly attenuated amplitude (7.04, Z-score -1.21), implying a flatter daily physiological fluctuation. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day (4:51 PM). While interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.43, Z-score 0.17), indicating consistent day-to-day patterns, intradaily variability is significantly elevated (0.64, Z-score 0.67). This suggests more frequent and larger short-term heart rate fluctuations within a single day, which, when combined with a low amplitude, could point to less robust or efficient physiological regulation. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest rates during the early morning (e.g., -16.71 at 6-7 AM) and increasing during waking hours, peaking around midday (13.71 at 12-1 PM) and evening (11.95 at 8-9 PM), aligning with the late acrophase.

The participant's behavioral habits reflect variable academic performance (GPAs ranging from 2.0 to 3.35). Substance use is generally low, with beer consumption at 1-2 times a month (Z-score 0.3) and other substances reported as ""Not at all."" Engagement in physical exercise is notably low across all categories, with exercising alone reported less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score -1.18) and other forms of exercise also at low frequencies. Daily recreational habits indicate above-average internet usage (2-3 hours daily, Z-score 0.85). In contrast, the participant reports significantly less engagement in social activities with friends (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score -1.41) and reading (""Do not do,"" Z-score -0.67), as well as below-average participation in other sedentary hobbies or video games. This pattern suggests a lifestyle with limited physical activity and social interaction, alongside a potentially higher reliance on screen-based activities.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To determine whether the participant's perceived stress level (PSS score) falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the cumulative evidence guided by the provided correlations. The population's median PSS score is 22.0.

**Evidence Supporting a PSS Score in the Bottom 50% (Lower/Average Perceived Stress):**
Several indicators suggest a relatively lower or average level of perceived stress. The participant's depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.34) are low, and this score is positively correlated with PSS (0.28), implying lower perceived stress. Similarly, trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.13) is average, with a positive correlation to PSS (0.31), also suggesting average perceived stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15), further supporting a lower stress level. Physiologically, the significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.18) and Mesor (Z-score -1.95), despite their small positive correlations (0.14 and 0.07 respectively), generally reflect good cardiovascular health, often associated with lower stress. High interdaily stability (Z-score 0.17) is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12), indicating a more consistent daily rhythm associated with lower stress. Furthermore, less variability in sleep start time (Z-score -0.23), positively correlated with PSS (0.17), suggests lower perceived stress. Engagement in sports at an average-to-slightly-above-average frequency (Z-score 0.25) is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.13), also pointing towards lower stress.

**Evidence Supporting a PSS Score in the Top 50% (Higher Perceived Stress):**
Conversely, a substantial body of evidence points towards elevated perceived stress. The participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53), which is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.19), strongly suggesting higher stress. Similarly, low health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78), negatively correlated with PSS (-0.07), indicates increased stress. Subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0) is a well-established correlate of heightened stress. Physiologically, the significantly low amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Z-score -1.21), negatively correlated with PSS (-0.16), implies a dampened physiological response that is associated with higher stress. Significantly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.67), positively correlated with PSS (0.16), suggests more erratic physiological fluctuations consistent with higher stress. High variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.17), positively correlated with PSS (0.14), is also indicative of higher stress. Behaviorally, above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.85), positively correlated with PSS (0.10), and significantly low engagement in reading (""Do not do,"" Z-score -0.67), negatively correlated with PSS (-0.21), both align with a pattern of higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits some protective factors like lower depressive symptoms, average trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and robust baseline cardiovascular fitness (low RHR, Mesor), these are outweighed by several strong indicators pointing towards elevated perceived stress. Notably, the participant's subjective experience of well-being is diminished, with lower happiness and health satisfaction. The presence of disturbed sleep quality, even with adequate duration, is a significant stressor. Physiologically, the combination of a flat heart rate amplitude and high intradaily variability suggests a less optimal or potentially dysregulated physiological response pattern, which, despite the low baseline heart rate, is correlated with higher stress. Furthermore, engagement in potentially maladaptive coping behaviors (high internet usage) and disengagement from beneficial activities (reading) further supports a state of elevated stress. The consistent pattern across subjective well-being, sleep, and physiological regulation points to a higher PSS score.

Considering the cumulative weight and magnitude of the Z-scores and their corresponding correlations, particularly those related to subjective well-being, sleep quality, and the dynamic aspects of heart rate variability, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress level is higher than the average study population.

29885,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a mixed psychological profile, characterized by a complex interplay of emotional states and adaptive strategies. Self-reported depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CESD score of 17.0 (Z-score 0.38), and trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 43.0 (Z-score 0.17), are both slightly above the study population mean. These elevations suggest mild levels of depressive symptomatology and chronic anxiety proneness. However, counterbalancing these findings, the participant reports above-average levels of happiness (Z-score 0.55) and notably high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.97). Conversely, self-esteem is somewhat lower than the population mean (Z-score -0.73). Academically, the participant has demonstrated an upward trend in GPA across recent semesters, suggesting effective coping and achievement within their academic environment.

Regarding sleep patterns and circadian rhythmicity, the participant reports subjectively disturbed sleep quality according to the PSQI (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), consistent with a slightly below-average median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes (Z-score -0.31) and a relatively late median sleep start time of 1:57 AM. Despite these subjective and objective indicators of potential sleep deficit and late schedule, objective wearable data reveals remarkable consistency in sleep. Both the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score -1.5) and sleep start time (Z-score -1.06) are significantly lower than the population mean, indicating highly regular sleep habits even if sleep onset is late. This consistency is mirrored in the participant’s physiological circadian rhythm, which demonstrates robust stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.0), low intraday variability (Z-score -0.81), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06). A substantial heart rate amplitude (Z-score 1.25), peaking in activity around 5:17 PM, further underscores a well-defined and strong biological rhythm. The participant also maintains a healthy, below-average resting heart rate of 53.2 bpm (Z-score -0.59), which generally signifies good cardiovascular fitness and lower chronic physiological stress.

In terms of daily activity and lifestyle behaviors, the participant exhibits high engagement in physical exercise, reporting frequencies significantly above the population average for exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), with others (Z-score 1.23), and participation in sports (Z-score 0.91). Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is also reported at frequencies above the mean (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreational habits include above-average time spent on video games (Z-score 0.96) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. While early morning hours show expected low heart rate deviations from the mesor, reflecting deep rest, a pronounced elevation in heart rate occurs during the late evening, particularly between 9 PM and 10 PM, where the mean deviation from the mesor reaches a high Z-score of 1.90. This significant late-day physiological activation could contribute to the subjectively reported sleep disturbance and the relatively late sleep onset time, indicating a state of heightened physiological arousal preceding the typical sleep window.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To assess whether the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution (with the 50th percentile at 22.0), we consider the available evidence.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards perceived stress levels that are likely at or below the population median. The participant exhibits remarkably strong and consistent physiological circadian rhythms, as evidenced by significantly above-average Interdaily Stability (Z=1.0, correlation with PSS = -0.12), below-average Intradaily Variability (Z=-0.81, correlation = 0.16), above-average Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z=1.06, correlation = -0.17), and a high Amplitude (Z=1.25, correlation = -0.16). These metrics consistently indicate robust physiological regulation and structure, which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting a buffering effect. Furthermore, the participant's resting heart rate is notably low (Z=-0.59), which also positively correlates with lower PSS (correlation = 0.14). Objectively measured sleep patterns, despite late timing and slightly short duration, show significantly lower variability in both duration (Z=-1.5) and start time (Z=-1.06), with both low variability metrics positively correlating with lower PSS. Subjectively, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z=0.55, correlation = -0.19) and notably high satisfaction with physical health (Z=0.97, correlation = -0.07), both of which are negatively associated with perceived stress. High engagement in physical exercise across multiple categories (all Z-scores > 0.9) further suggests healthy coping mechanisms, even with weak correlations to PSS.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**
Conversely, several indicators suggest potential for elevated perceived stress. The participant reports slightly above-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.38, correlation with PSS = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.17, correlation = 0.31), both of which are positively correlated with higher PSS. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI Z=0.13), indicating self-perceived difficulties. Lower self-esteem (Z=-0.73, correlation = -0.15) also negatively correlates with PSS, implying that lower self-esteem is associated with higher perceived stress. A significant physiological finding is the pronounced late evening heart rate elevation between 9 PM and 10 PM (Z=1.90), suggesting a period of heightened arousal before the late sleep onset. While the correlation of this specific hourly deviation with PSS is weak (-0.04), sustained late-night arousal can contribute to stress and perceived sleep problems. Above-average alcohol consumption could also be a maladaptive coping mechanism, though its correlation with PSS is weak.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant reports certain psychological symptoms (mild depression and anxiety) and subjective sleep disturbance that typically correlate with higher perceived stress, the overwhelming strength and consistency of the objective physiological data paint a different picture. The participant demonstrates exceptional circadian rhythm stability and a low resting heart rate, coupled with highly consistent sleep patterns (albeit slightly short and late). These robust physiological markers of regulation and resilience, supported by their consistent negative correlations with PSS, suggest an underlying biological capacity to manage stress effectively. Furthermore, high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction act as strong counter-indicators to a high PSS score. Despite the subjective challenges, the participant's physiological system appears well-regulated, and their overall well-being in key domains is strong. Therefore, the physiological and well-being strengths likely buffer the impact of self-reported symptoms, leading to a perceived stress level that is not among the highest in the population.

79167,10.0,0.010362694300518135,"The participant exhibits a comprehensive profile characterized by robust psychological well-being and a highly active, healthy lifestyle, alongside specific physiological patterns indicating both cardiovascular fitness and notable early morning physiological arousal.

**Psychological Well-being and Lifestyle Patterns**
The self-reported data reveal a participant with notably low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.71), both classified as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. These findings are further supported by a high self-esteem score (Z-score: 1.24) and very high self-reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64). Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with increasing GPAs. Subjective assessment of sleep quality using the PSQI indicates ""Good Sleep"" (Z-score: -0.8), aligning with objective Fitbit data showing a long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes (Z-score: 1.25) and good consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score: -0.32) and start time (standard deviation Z-score: -0.39). The participant also maintains a very active lifestyle, engaging in exercise alone, with others, and in sports frequently (all Z-scores > 1.0, with sports particularly high at Z=1.58). Leisure activities are characterized by minimal engagement in passive screen-based entertainment (e.g., Internet usage Z-score: -2.5, Listening to Music Z-score: -1.19) and balanced social interaction and reading. Moderate alcohol consumption is reported, with no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Collectively, these self-reported and objective behavioral metrics suggest a highly adaptive and resilient psychological state, coupled with a health-promoting lifestyle.

**Physiological Arousal and Circadian Rhythm Characteristics**
Physiologically, the participant demonstrates indicators of good cardiovascular fitness, with a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.65) and a lower overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score: -0.81) across the recording period. However, the hourly heart rate deviation data reveal a pronounced pattern of early morning physiological arousal. Specifically, there is an exceptionally high positive deviation from the mesor between 6-7 AM (Z-score: 3.07) and 7-8 AM (Z-score: 2.69), indicating a sharp and significant increase in heart rate relative to the participant's daily average during these hours, well above the population mean. This rapid physiological activation upon waking or early in the day is a salient feature. Regarding circadian rhythmicity, the heart rate data indicate lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.07) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.87), coupled with higher intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.74) and a lower amplitude (Z-score: -1.03). These patterns collectively suggest a less regular and potentially more fragmented heart rate rhythm, with a blunted difference between peak and trough activity, which could reflect less robust physiological regulation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The overwhelming majority of the participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data points towards a low level of perceived stress. The exceptionally low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD, Z-score -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI, Z-score -1.71) are particularly strong indicators, as these have moderate positive correlations with PSS scores (0.28 and 0.3, respectively); thus, low scores here imply lower perceived stress. Furthermore, high self-esteem (Z-score 1.24, correlation -0.15) and high happiness (Z-score 1.64, correlation -0.18) are protective factors against stress. The participant's engagement in extensive physical exercise (multiple categories with Z-scores > 1.0) and a general lifestyle that eschews passive screen-based recreation support healthy coping. Objectively, strong sleep metrics (long duration, high consistency, good subjective quality via PSQI Z-score -0.8) are typically associated with lower stress. Finally, a lower resting heart rate and mesor suggest good overall cardiovascular health and less chronic physiological arousal, which generally correlates with lower stress.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The primary evidence suggesting elevated perceived stress stems from the wearable-derived physiological data, specifically the pronounced early morning heart rate deviations from the mesor. The extremely high positive Z-scores for heart rate between 6-7 AM (Z=3.07) and 7-8 AM (Z=2.69) indicate a significant physiological arousal response upon waking, which for the 6-7 AM period, correlates moderately positively with PSS (0.23). This could signify anticipatory stress or a robust sympathetic nervous system activation. Additionally, aspects of the circadian rhythm, such as lower interdaily stability (Z=-1.07, correlation -0.13), higher intradaily variability (Z=0.74, correlation 0.17), and lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=-0.87, correlation -0.18), suggest some physiological dysregulation or a less robust daily rhythm. Higher intradaily variability, in particular, has a weak positive correlation with PSS.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the physiological data presents a clear signal of early morning arousal and some circadian rhythm irregularity, the self-reported psychological and behavioral profile of this participant is overwhelmingly indicative of robust mental health, high subjective well-being, and very healthy lifestyle habits. The low scores on measures of depression and anxiety, which have the strongest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset, provide compelling evidence that the participant likely experiences lower perceived stress. Although the physiological arousal is notable, perceived stress (PSS) is a subjective measure. It is plausible that an individual with such strong psychological resources and healthy coping mechanisms might experience physiological manifestations of stress without perceiving their overall stress levels as high. The balance of evidence, particularly from the self-report measures that directly assess psychological distress and well-being, strongly suggests a lower subjective burden of stress.

22455,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by a strong self-reported psychological well-being despite objective physiological markers suggesting potential strain or atypical patterns. Psychologically, the individual demonstrates a low propensity for anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score significantly below the population mean (Z-score -1.31), and reports high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1) and current happiness (Z-score 1.64). Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is notably high (Z-score 1.96). These factors, all exhibiting relevant correlations with perceived stress, collectively suggest a robust internal psychological landscape that could buffer against the subjective experience of stress. Lifestyle behaviors include consistent engagement in individual exercise (Z-score 1.07) and an absence of substance use. While recreational activities involve high engagement in passive media consumption (TV/videos/movies and internet usage, both Z-scores > 1.5), the participant also reports above-average time socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95). A notable deviation is the very low self-reported trust in others (Z-score -2.71), although this factor exhibits a negligible correlation with perceived stress in this dataset.

Physiologically, the participant's sleep patterns reveal significant deviations from population norms. Despite a subjectively reported good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8), objective Fitbit data indicates a significantly shorter median sleep duration of 6 hours 7 minutes (Z-score -1.33) and a high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.94). This objective insufficiency and irregularity in sleep, coupled with a slightly increased frequency of napping (Z-score 0.7), suggests a potential underlying sleep debt or struggle to maintain consistent sleep, which can contribute to physiological stress. Although the median sleep start time is relatively consistent, the overall sleep profile points to a discrepancy between perceived and actual sleep health.

The participant's heart rate dynamics further elaborate on this physiological pattern. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor, Z-score -1.04) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.52) are both lower than average, generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly reduced (Z-score -1.52), suggesting a blunted daily physiological fluctuation that, based on its negative correlation, is associated with higher perceived stress. Circadian regularity metrics indicate lower-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and slightly higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.32), implying less consistent daily rhythms and more frequent physiological fluctuations, both of which correlate positively with perceived stress. Most strikingly, the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals an exceptionally early and pronounced morning heart rate surge, with the deviation from Mesor reaching an extreme high between 5-6 AM (Z-score 6.2). This indicates a highly activated physiological arousal phase occurring very early in the day, well beyond population norms, following an earlier-than-average shift from nocturnal low heart rates. Daytime heart rate activity generally remains within average to slightly below-average ranges, with an earlier and more rapid physiological wind-down observed in the evening hours. This combination of robust psychological resources with physiological indicators of compromised sleep and an exaggerated early morning arousal suggests a potential disjunction between the subjective experience of stress and underlying physiological regulation.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Based on a holistic analysis of the available evidence, the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), would likely place them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution.

Evidence strongly supporting a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is primarily derived from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.31, with a positive PSS correlation of 0.32, indicating lower anxiety predicts lower PSS), high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1, with a negative PSS correlation of -0.16), high reported happiness (Z-score 1.64, with a negative PSS correlation of -0.20), and high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.96, with a negative PSS correlation of -0.09). These are direct indicators of subjective psychological well-being and are consistently associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the CESD score is classified as ""Not depressed"" (Z-score -0.14), and the subjective PSQI score indicates ""Good Sleep"" (Z-score -0.8).

Conversely, several physiological and behavioral metrics, while notable in their deviation from population norms, show weaker or moderate correlations with perceived stress. These include significantly short and variable sleep duration (Z-scores -1.33 and 0.94, respectively, with low PSS correlations of -0.03 and 0.13), a blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.52, PSS correlation -0.16), and reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9, PSS correlation -0.11). While the exceptionally early and exaggerated morning heart rate surge (Z-score 6.2) is a strong physiological indicator of arousal, its direct impact on *perceived* stress for this individual is not explicitly quantified by a correlation in the dataset. It is plausible that the participant's robust psychological coping mechanisms, as evidenced by their self-report, allow them to subjectively perceive less stress despite physiological patterns that might typically accompany elevated stress. Given that the PSS measures *perceived* stress, the consistent and strong indicators from the self-report data directly assessing subjective well-being are weighted more heavily in this assessment.

57443,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and physiological profile, revealing both potential vulnerabilities and significant compensatory strengths. While self-reported depressive symptoms are somewhat elevated (CESD score 19.0, Z-score 0.59), indicating a higher burden of such symptoms compared to the study population, trait anxiety levels are average (STAI score 40.0, Z-score -0.13). Contrasting with depressive symptomology, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), both of which are inversely associated with perceived stress. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently improving GPAs, also suggests effective functioning in a key domain for university students. Overall physical health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.22). The participant reports no substance use across various categories, which is indicative of a health-conscious lifestyle. Engagement in exercise is relatively low, with infrequent participation in both solo and group activities, a factor typically associated with higher stress. Recreational habits show a notable preference for listening to music (Z-score 1.13) and average social engagement, while engagement in screen-based activities and sedentary hobbies is notably low.

Physiological and behavioral patterns derived from wearable data reveal a striking degree of regularity and consistency. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75) and very high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.15) in heart rate patterns, signifying a highly consistent and structured daily physiological rhythm. This regularity is a significant protective factor against stress. While the mean heart rate (Mesor = 80.19 bpm, Z-score 0.85) and resting heart rate (61.2 bpm, Z-score 0.36) are both somewhat elevated, suggesting a higher baseline physiological arousal, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also above average (Z-score 0.69), indicating a pronounced difference between peak and trough activity. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:40 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor indicates a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest heart rates during early morning sleep hours and progressive increases throughout the day. Notably, there are periods of significantly elevated heart rate, particularly between 1-3 PM and 6-7 PM, where deviations from the mesor show high positive Z-scores (up to 1.58), suggesting pronounced physiological arousal during these times which could correspond to academic demands or other daily activities.

Sleep patterns further contribute to the nuanced profile. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), placing them well below the population average for sleep disturbance. Objectively, wearable data shows an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 14 minutes. Critically, the standard deviation of sleep duration is remarkably low (42 minutes, Z-score -1.33), indicating exceptional consistency in the amount of sleep obtained each night, a robust indicator of good sleep hygiene. Variability in sleep start time is average (81 minutes, Z-score -0.03). The participant also reports no napping, which is below the population average. The combination of good subjective sleep quality and highly consistent objective sleep duration, alongside stable circadian rhythms, suggests a strong foundation for recovery and resilience, despite the elevated depressive symptoms and baseline physiological arousal.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
The primary evidence suggesting a higher perceived stress score for this participant is the elevated score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), with a Z-score of 0.59, indicating depressive symptoms above the population mean. Given the positive correlation of CESD with PSS (0.28), this points towards potentially elevated stress. Additionally, the participant exhibits an elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.85) and a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.36), both of which are associated, albeit weakly, with higher perceived stress (correlations of 0.06 and 0.14 respectively). The pronounced peaks in hourly heart rate deviation during specific daytime periods also suggest significant physiological arousal that could contribute to feelings of stress. The low frequency of exercise, which generally functions as a stress buffer, also removes a potential protective factor.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, there is substantial evidence pointing towards a lower or average perceived stress score. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), both of which are inversely correlated with PSS (-0.19 and -0.15, respectively). Critically, subjective sleep quality is very good (PSQI Z-score -0.8), a strong indicator of lower stress as PSQI correlates positively with PSS (meaning lower PSQI scores imply lower PSS). Objectively, the participant demonstrates remarkably consistent sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score -1.33), indicating high sleep regularity, which is strongly associated with lower stress (the positive correlation of 0.15 with PSS refers to *variability*, meaning low variability implies low PSS). Furthermore, circadian rhythm metrics show very high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.15), reflecting a structured and regular daily physiological routine. Both of these metrics have inverse correlations with PSS (-0.12 and -0.18, respectively), strongly suggesting a lower stress level. The average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.13), absence of substance use, and strong academic performance further support a picture of effective functioning and resilience. The amplitude of heart rate (Z-score 0.69) also has a negative correlation with PSS (-0.17).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the presence of elevated depressive symptoms and a higher baseline heart rate might suggest a predisposition to higher stress, these indicators are substantially offset by a robust suite of protective factors. The participant's high levels of happiness, strong self-esteem, excellent subjective and objective sleep quality and consistency, and highly regular daily physiological rhythms (circadian stability) are all strong indicators of lower perceived stress. These factors, particularly the sleep and circadian rhythm regularity, are potent stress-buffering mechanisms. The correlations between these protective factors and PSS are generally stronger and more numerous than those pointing towards higher stress. Therefore, despite some indicators of internal struggle and physiological arousal, the comprehensive analysis suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress level is more likely to fall within the lower half of the study population distribution due to these significant resilience factors.

94579,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates elevated levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) score of 24.0, classified as ""Depressed,"" places the participant notably above the population mean (Z-score of 1.11), and this measure correlates positively with perceived stress. Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 44.0, categorized as ""anxious,"" is moderately above the population average (Z-score of 0.27) and also shows a positive association with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.53) and negatively correlates with perceived stress, reinforcing a picture of psychological distress. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, has shown a notable decline across three semesters (3.5 to 3.0), which could reflect increasing academic pressure or difficulties that may contribute to overall stress. In contrast, self-esteem is approximately average (Z-score of -0.17), and satisfaction with physical health is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.55), though the latter has a weak negative correlation with perceived stress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, reporting engagement in exercise alone, with others, and sports ""Three times a week or more,"" with all associated Z-scores significantly above the population mean (1.07, 1.23, and 1.58, respectively). Substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs, is consistently reported at very low frequencies, with Z-scores well below population averages. These health-promoting behaviors might function as coping mechanisms. Recreational activities indicate varied engagement; while screen time for watching TV/videos is average, time spent on video games, listening to music, and socializing with friends is moderately high. Notably, the participant reports exceptionally high engagement in reading (Z-score of 4.24) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score of 2.01). Subjectively, sleep quality is reported as ""Good Sleep"" on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with a Z-score of -0.8, suggesting better-than-average perceived sleep.

However, objective wearable data presents a contrasting picture regarding sleep patterns. Despite the self-reported ""Good Sleep,"" the participant exhibits significantly irregular sleep, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours 38 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score of -0.69). More critically, there is extreme variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 242 minutes, Z-score of 3.21) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 153 minutes, Z-score of 1.54). Both of these high variability metrics show a positive correlation with perceived stress, indicating a highly inconsistent sleep schedule that could contribute to physiological and psychological burden. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data generally suggest moderate to high stability and amplitude (Interdaily Stability Z=0.67, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z=0.48, Amplitude Z=0.39), with a typical mesor and average resting heart rate (Z-score of -0.07). The acrophase, or peak heart rate, consistently occurs at 4:17 PM. These patterns suggest a relatively robust underlying cardiovascular rhythm despite the sleep timing issues, potentially indicating the system's attempts to maintain regularity amidst behavioral inconsistency.

Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal typical diurnal patterns, with mean heart rate being significantly lower during night hours and elevated during the day. Specifically, substantial deviations below the mesor are observed during the early morning (e.g., -22.85 bpm from 5-6 AM). Conversely, distinct peaks in heart rate deviation are present during late morning (10-11 AM, Z-score of 1.51) and early afternoon (2-3 PM, Z-score of 1.15). These pronounced elevations during common academic or work hours, relative to the population, could indicate periods of heightened physiological arousal, stress, or intense activity, beyond typical daily fluctuations. A notable dip in heart rate deviation from the mesor occurs in the early evening (6-7 PM, Z-score of -1.39), potentially indicating a period of significant relaxation or reduced activity at that time.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low/Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**:
The participant reports several lifestyle factors typically associated with lower perceived stress. Self-reported physical health satisfaction is above average (Z=0.55), and the participant engages in consistently high levels of physical exercise across multiple categories (Z-scores > 1.0), which is a well-established buffer against stress. Substance use is notably low across all reported categories (all Z-scores are negative), suggesting healthy coping strategies in this domain. Subjectively, the participant perceives their sleep as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z=-0.8). Furthermore, several objective circadian rhythm parameters, such as Interdaily Stability (Z=0.67), Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z=0.48), and Amplitude (Z=0.39), are above average and show negative correlations with PSS, suggesting a relatively stable and robust cardiovascular rhythm. The resting heart rate is also average (Z=-0.07), indicating good baseline cardiovascular health.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%)**:
Conversely, several key indicators strongly suggest elevated perceived stress. The participant's self-reported psychological state includes elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score classified as ""Depressed,"" Z=1.11, with a positive PSS correlation of 0.29) and trait anxiety (STAI score classified as ""anxious,"" Z=0.27, with a positive PSS correlation of 0.32). Lower self-reported happiness (Z=-0.53) also correlates negatively with PSS. A concerning decline in GPA from 3.5 to 3.0 over three semesters could be a significant source and indicator of academic stress. Most compellingly, the objective wearable sleep data reveals extreme dysregulation: exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (SD = 242 minutes, Z=3.21) and sleep start time (SD = 153 minutes, Z=1.54). Both of these metrics exhibit positive correlations with PSS (0.17 and 0.18 respectively), indicating that this objective sleep inconsistency is strongly associated with higher stress, despite the participant's subjective perception of good sleep. Additionally, the pronounced peaks in hourly heart rate deviation during typical academic hours (10-11 AM with Z=1.51, and 2-3 PM with Z=1.15) could signify periods of sustained physiological arousal or high-stress engagement.

**Holistic Analysis**:
While the participant engages in several positive health behaviors (e.g., exercise, low substance use) and exhibits some objective physiological stability, the direct measures of psychological distress (elevated CESD and STAI scores) are highly indicative of increased perceived stress. Crucially, the extreme objective variability in sleep duration and timing, which directly contradicts subjective good sleep, is a potent physiological marker of dysregulation and has strong positive correlations with PSS. This discrepancy suggests the participant may not fully recognize the impact of their inconsistent sleep schedule. Combined with the concerning trend in academic performance, the evidence for elevated psychological and physiological strain heavily outweighs the buffering effects of positive lifestyle choices. Therefore, considering the severity and direct correlation of these factors, the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely to be in the upper half of the study population distribution.

29257,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"This participant exhibits a nuanced profile characterized by robust psychological well-being and generally healthy physiological indicators, alongside some notable irregularities in sleep and circadian rhythm patterns. Self-report data indicates a very low burden of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 2.0 (Z-score -1.18) classifying the individual as not depressed, and a STAI score of 31.0 (Z-score -1.02) indicating low trait anxiety. These psychological states are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (Score 46.0, Z-Score 1.1) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Score 5.22, Z-score 0.72), both of which are generally protective against stress. Academic performance, as indicated by a consistently high GPA, suggests effective management of academic demands. Lifestyle habits include above-average beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01) and high engagement in listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), while other recreational activities like internet usage and reading are notably low.

Physiological and sleep data provide a more complex picture. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-Score -1.26), placing them in the ""Good Sleep"" category. Objectively, median sleep duration is healthy at 7 hours 49 minutes (Z-Score 0.79). However, a significant finding is the high standard deviation in sleep duration (151 minutes, Z-Score 1.14), indicating considerable day-to-day variability in total sleep time, despite a relatively consistent sleep start time. Circadian rhythm metrics further elaborate on this. While the participant shows a relatively strong 24-hour rhythm as evidenced by high Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-Score 0.81), there is significantly low Interdaily Stability (Z-Score -1.23), suggesting less regularity in activity and rest patterns from day to day. The circadian amplitude is also lower than average (Z-Score -0.75), indicating a less pronounced difference between peak and trough physiological activity. The Mesor (average heart rate) and Resting Heart Rate are within a healthy range (Z-scores near zero), and the hourly heart rate deviations reveal a healthy physiological dip during early morning sleep, with heart rates dropping significantly below the resting heart rate, indicative of good nocturnal recovery. Daytime heart rate patterns are typical, peaking in the late afternoon, consistent with the observed acrophase of 5:43 PM.

In summary, the participant demonstrates strong psychological resilience with very low levels of depressive and anxious symptoms, high self-esteem, and good subjective sleep quality. Physiologically, their resting heart rate and capacity for nocturnal recovery are healthy. However, the objective data points to an underlying physiological and behavioral irregularity in sleep duration and circadian rhythm stability, which, while not manifesting as perceived poor sleep quality or high mental distress according to self-reports, warrants attention. The discordance between strong self-reported well-being and objective circadian irregularities suggests a potential area of compensatory behaviors or a buffering effect of positive psychological traits.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial and primarily derived from the participant's self-reported psychological state. The remarkably low CESD (Z-score -1.18) and STAI (Z-score -1.02) scores are strong indicators of low depressive and anxiety symptoms, which have positive correlations with PSS, meaning lower scores predict lower perceived stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 1.1) and good health satisfaction (Z-score 0.72) also negatively correlate with PSS, further suggesting lower stress. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by PSQI (Z-score -1.26), is excellent, which is consistently linked to lower perceived stress. Objective sleep duration is adequate (Z-score 0.79), and the healthy resting heart rate along with significant nocturnal heart rate deceleration indicates good physiological recovery. The high academic performance also suggests effective coping with academic demands.

Conversely, evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is primarily derived from objective wearable data related to physiological regularity. The high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score 1.14) and low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.23) suggest inconsistency in daily and sleep-wake patterns. A lower circadian amplitude (Z-score -0.75) also points to a less robust physiological rhythm. These metrics generally correlate with higher perceived stress (positive correlation for sleep duration standard deviation, negative for interdaily stability and amplitude). Additionally, above-average alcohol consumption could sometimes serve as a coping mechanism, though its correlation with PSS is minimal in this dataset.

Performing a holistic analysis, the strong and direct self-reported measures of mental health and well-being (CESD, STAI, Self-Esteem, PSQI) provide compelling evidence for a lower perceived stress level. The correlations for these self-report measures with PSS are notable, indicating a robust relationship. While the physiological and sleep regularity metrics suggest some underlying physiological dysregulation that typically correlates with higher stress, their correlations with PSS are weaker than those of the psychological well-being measures. The participant's consistent academic success further suggests good adaptive functioning. Given the prominent and consistent indicators of low psychological distress and good subjective well-being, these factors are likely to strongly influence their overall perception of stress. Therefore, despite some objective physiological irregularities, the bulk of the evidence points towards a relatively low or average level of perceived stress.

49539,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notably resilient psychological profile as indicated by self-report measures. Depressive symptoms are significantly low, with a CESD score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.07), classifying the participant as ""Not depressed."" Similarly, trait anxiety is exceptionally low, with a STAI score of 23.0 (Z-score -1.81), classified as ""not anxious."" These low scores on measures of distress are typically associated with lower perceived stress. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and elevated satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.8) further contribute to this robust psychological well-being, both correlating negatively with perceived stress. Academic performance demonstrates a consistent upward trend with GPA, suggesting effective management of academic demands. However, self-reported current happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), which, given its negative correlation with PSS, could indicate a modest contribution to perceived stress.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates healthy habits by reporting no use of alcohol, recreational, or non-prescribed drugs. While engagement in solitary or social exercise is lower than average, regular participation in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91) provides a beneficial physical activity outlet that is negatively correlated with PSS. Daily recreational activities show varied engagement; lower than average time is spent on passive entertainment like TV/videos and video games, as well as less socializing. Conversely, time spent reading is slightly above average and is negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting it may serve as a positive coping or relaxation mechanism.

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, which exceeds the clinical threshold. However, objective Fitbit data show a median sleep duration within the average range (7 hours 20 minutes) and, notably, significantly low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -1.47) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.96). This suggests a consistent and regular sleep schedule, even if the median sleep start time is late (01:45 AM).

Physiologically, the participant displays characteristics indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, including a significantly low mesor (average heart rate, Z-score -1.57) and resting heart rate (Z-score -1.23). Circadian rhythms exhibit higher-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.64), pointing to consistent daily physiological patterns. However, a significant deviation from these stable patterns is evident in the intradaily variability, which is notably high (Z-score 2.01) and positively correlated with PSS (0.16). This suggests a fragmented or less smooth heart rate rhythm within the day, indicative of increased physiological arousal. Furthermore, aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a highly anomalous and extreme elevation in heart rate late at night (11 PM - 12 AM), with a deviation from the mesor reaching a Z-score of 4.79. While this pronounced nocturnal activation is a striking physiological event, its correlation with PSS is negative (-0.14), suggesting that for this individual, this specific period of physiological activity is associated with lower, rather than higher, perceived stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological state provides strong evidence for a relatively low perceived stress level. Critically, scores on the CESD and STAI scales are significantly below the population mean (Z-scores of -1.07 and -1.81 respectively), indicating very low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Given their positive correlations with PSS, these exceptionally low scores are powerful indicators for lower perceived stress. Furthermore, higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8), both negatively correlated with PSS, contribute to a reduced stress profile. Lifestyle factors such as no substance use, consistent academic achievement, and above-average sports participation (negatively correlated with PSS) also suggest effective coping mechanisms. Physiologically, a notably low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.23) and mesor (Z-score -1.57) indicate robust cardiovascular health, which is generally protective against stress. Objective sleep data show high regularity in sleep duration and start time (low standard deviations), which typically supports lower stress. The most extreme physiological anomaly, the late-night heart rate elevation (Z-score 4.79), surprisingly correlates negatively with PSS (-0.14), suggesting it is not a perceived stressor and potentially a form of engaging activity that mitigates subjective stress.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Despite the aforementioned strengths, some data points suggest potential contributors to elevated perceived stress. The self-reported PSQI score of 6.0 indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, although its Z-score (-0.33) is below average, and its correlation with PSS is negligible. Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), and given its negative correlation with PSS (-0.19), this lower happiness could contribute to higher perceived stress. Most prominently, the participant exhibits significantly elevated intradaily variability (IV) in heart rate (Z-score 2.01), which is positively correlated with PSS (0.16). This high fragmentation in physiological rhythms indicates a state of chronic physiological arousal that is linked to higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When synthesizing the multimodal data, the robust psychological profile of the participant, characterized by exceptionally low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, strong self-esteem, and good health satisfaction, presents a compelling case for a lower level of perceived stress. These self-reported measures directly assess the subjective experience of distress and show very strong protective factors. While the elevated intradaily variability and disturbed sleep suggest physiological arousal and potential sleep issues, the impact on *perceived* stress appears to be outweighed by the participant's psychological resilience. The most extreme physiological finding – the significant late-night heart rate elevation – is notably correlated with *lower* perceived stress, suggesting it may represent active engagement rather than a stressor for this individual. Considering the strong negative Z-scores for STAI and CESD, which have moderate positive correlations with PSS, these factors would substantially lower the participant's PSS score relative to the population. Therefore, despite some physiological markers of arousal, the overall evidence points towards a participant who perceives relatively less stress.

63904,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits elevated levels of psychological distress, as evidenced by significantly high scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD score 30.0, Z-score 1.74) and trait anxiety (STAI score 53.0, Z-score 1.16). These scores place the participant well above the population average for both metrics, indicating a substantial burden of depressive and anxious symptomatology. Consistent with these findings, self-reported happiness (score 2.0, Z-score -1.61), self-esteem (score 30.0, Z-score -1.15), and trust in others (score 2.17, Z-score -2.07) are notably lower than the study population mean, suggesting a generalized negative affective and interpersonal disposition. Satisfaction with physical health is also slightly below average (score 3.44, Z-score -0.62). The positive correlations of CESD (0.28) and STAI (0.31) with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score suggest that these psychological states are meaningfully associated with perceived stress levels within the study population.

The participant's sleep patterns are characterized by chronic and severe short sleep duration, consistently falling below the recommended amount. Objective wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 5 hours 49 minutes (Z-score -1.69), which is significantly shorter than the study population average. Despite this short duration, there is high regularity in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 30 minutes, Z-score -1.61) and sleep start time (median 01:34:29, standard deviation of 60 minutes, Z-score -0.5). This suggests a consistent pattern of late bedtime and insufficient sleep. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, classified as 'Disturbed Sleep', further corroborates issues with sleep quality, despite its Z-score (-0.33) indicating it is not among the highest within this university population. The lack of napping (mean daily naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86) also points to limited compensatory sleep behaviors.

Behavioral data indicate very low engagement in physical activity, with the participant reporting ""not at all"" for all categories of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93). This lack of physical activity is a notable deviation from population norms and may impact stress coping mechanisms. In terms of daily recreation, the participant engages in internet usage and socializing with friends for 2-3 hours daily, placing them above average in these activities (Z-scores 0.85 and 0.95 respectively), while largely avoiding other common leisure activities such as reading, watching TV, or engaging in hobbies. Substance use is reported as ""not at all"" across all categories, indicating an absence of substance-based coping. Physiologically, aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal a consistent pattern of pronounced cardiovascular arousal in the mornings, specifically between 7-9 AM, with Z-scores peaking at 1.58 for 8-9 AM. This indicates a significantly higher heart rate deviation from their mesor during these hours compared to the population, suggesting an elevated physiological activation during the typical start of the academic day. The participant also shows a slightly elevated resting heart rate (60.5 bpm, Z-score 0.28) and a slightly elevated overall mean heart rate (Mesor 76.66 bpm, Z-score 0.37).

Further analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms indicates a generally stable structure across days but with some internal variability. The participant demonstrates higher-than-average interdaily stability (0.53, Z-score 1.0) and a strong 24-hour autocorrelation (0.45, Z-score 1.06), reflecting consistent daily patterns in heart rate. However, intradaily variability is also above average (0.63, Z-score 0.6), suggesting more frequent and/or larger fluctuations in heart rate within a single day. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is average (10.59, Z-score -0.06), indicating a typical range between peak and trough heart rate activity, with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring in the mid-afternoon at 3:36 PM. The higher interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, which are weakly negatively correlated with PSS, might suggest some protective regularity, but the elevated intradaily variability, which is weakly positively correlated with PSS, points towards periods of internal physiological fluctuation that may be associated with increased stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated perceived stress level comes from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant's scores on the CES-D (30.0, Z-score 1.74) and STAI (53.0, Z-score 1.16) are substantially higher than the population mean, classifying them with elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, respectively. Both of these measures exhibit moderate positive correlations with the PSS score (CES-D: 0.28, STAI: 0.31), indicating a strong association with higher perceived stress. Additionally, lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) and self-esteem (Z-score -1.15), both negatively correlated with PSS, further support a profile consistent with higher stress. Physiologically, the participant displays a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.28), which is weakly positively correlated with PSS (0.14), and an above-average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.6), also weakly positively correlated with PSS (0.16). The consistently high hourly heart rate deviations in the early morning (7-9 AM, Z-scores up to 1.58) suggest a pronounced physiological arousal response at the start of the day. From a behavioral standpoint, the participant exhibits chronic, objective sleep deprivation (median sleep duration 5 hours 49 minutes, Z-score -1.69) and a marked absence of physical exercise, both of which are significant stressors and likely contribute to higher perceived stress, even if their direct correlations with PSS are not always strong.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**
A few metrics suggest a potentially lower or more average perceived stress level. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0, while indicating disturbed sleep, has a Z-score of -0.33, meaning it is relatively lower than the average PSQI score within the study population. Additionally, the participant demonstrates higher interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0) and a stronger 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06) in their heart rate circadian rhythm, both of which are weakly negatively correlated with PSS (-0.12 and -0.17, respectively), suggesting that a more regular daily rhythm might be associated with lower stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits less variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -1.61) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.5), which, based on their positive correlations with PSS (0.15 and 0.17 respectively), would imply that lower variability is associated with lower perceived stress. The complete absence of substance use also removes a potential source of additional stress or maladaptive coping.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Upon holistic analysis, the overwhelming evidence points towards a high perceived stress level. While the participant demonstrates some regularity in circadian rhythms and sleep timing, and a relatively lower PSQI score compared to the population average, these factors are strongly counterbalanced by critically elevated measures of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, consistently low self-esteem and happiness, chronic and severe sleep deprivation, and a complete lack of physical exercise. The pronounced physiological arousal in the mornings and a generally elevated resting heart rate further support a state of heightened physiological strain. The strong positive correlations of CES-D and STAI with PSS are particularly influential in this assessment. Therefore, based on the comprehensive data, the participant’s perceived stress level is likely to be higher than the majority of the study population.

20335,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notably robust psychological profile, characterized by significantly lower self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety compared to the study population. Specifically, scores on the CES-D (Z-score -1.18) and STAI (Z-score -1.81) are well below average, indicating a reduced burden of these mental health concerns. Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score 1.66) and current happiness (Z-score 1.64) are considerably elevated. These positive psychological indicators, coupled with high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3), generally correlate negatively with perceived stress, suggesting a strong internal resilience against stressors.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in solitary exercise three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07), which is above the population average. Recreational habits are diverse and include substantial time spent socializing with friends (Z-score 1.74), playing video games (Z-score 1.71), and reading (Z-score 1.3), alongside a highly elevated commitment to a sedentary hobby (Z-score 2.01). Notably, increased reading time is moderately negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.21), potentially serving as a beneficial coping mechanism. Substance use is generally low, with moderately elevated wine or liquor consumption (Z-score 0.94) but negligible engagement with recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Academic performance, as indicated by consistent GPAs, is strong.

Regarding sleep, the participant subjectively reports good sleep quality as measured by the PSQI (Z-score -0.8). However, objective wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 35 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.74). A distinctive pattern is the remarkably consistent and late median sleep start time of 01:53:44, with exceptionally low variability (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score -1.24). This indicates a highly regimented, albeit delayed, sleep schedule. Physiologically, the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm demonstrates high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.33) and autocorrelation, signifying a well-entrained and regular daily rhythm. The amplitude of this rhythm is also higher than average (Z-score 0.9), further suggesting a robust distinction between peak and trough activity. However, intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z-score 0.81), potentially indicating some internal fragmentation within the daily heart rate pattern. The acrophase, or peak physiological arousal, consistently occurs around 6:06 PM.

An analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, interpreted relative to the participant's resting heart rate (55.0 bpm), highlights a distinct pattern of physiological arousal. While daytime heart rates are appropriately elevated, peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (consistent with the acrophase), there is an unusual and exceptionally high heart rate observed during the late evening and early morning hours. Specifically, the deviation between 12-1 AM (Z-score 3.66) translates to a heart rate around 102 bpm, which is substantially higher than the resting rate and represents an extreme level of physiological arousal during a typical quiescent period. This pronounced elevation gradually subsides, leading to heart rates dropping below the resting rate between 4-7 AM, indicating deep physiological rest following this intense late-night activity. This pattern suggests prolonged wakefulness with significant activity or arousal immediately preceding the participant's consistent late sleep onset.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower or average perceived stress score stems from the participant's self-reported psychological state. Depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.18) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.81) are markedly below the population mean, and both are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting a lower PSS score. Conversely, self-esteem (Z-score 1.66) and current happiness (Z-score 1.64) are significantly higher than average and exhibit negative correlations with PSS, further supporting a lower perceived stress level. High satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3), also negatively correlated with PSS, adds to this protective psychological profile. Behaviorally, the participant engages in above-average solitary exercise and dedicates substantial time to reading, the latter showing a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), indicating a potentially effective coping strategy. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.37) and weakly positively correlated with PSS, aligning with lower stress. Furthermore, a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.33, weakly negatively correlated with PSS) suggests robust physiological regulation.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Despite subjective reports of good sleep, objective data reveals a shorter median sleep duration (6 hours 35 minutes, Z-score -0.74) and a very late, albeit consistent, sleep start time (01:53:44). Chronic sleep deprivation, even if not subjectively perceived as poor quality, can contribute to elevated physiological and psychological stress. The most striking physiological indicator is the exceptionally high heart rate deviation observed between 10 PM and 1 AM, peaking dramatically at 12-1 AM (Z-score 3.66). This extreme physiological arousal immediately prior to sleep onset is an atypical pattern that could signify significant late-night activity, compensatory behaviors, or underlying physiological strain. Although the direct correlation of this specific hourly deviation with PSS is weakly negative (-0.07), such a pronounced physiological response during a period typically associated with winding down could indicate a state of chronic activation that might indirectly impact stress levels. Additionally, intradaily variability of heart rate is higher than average (Z-score 0.81) and weakly positively correlated with PSS (0.16), suggesting some fragmentation in physiological activity within the day.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant's profile presents a dichotomy: exceptionally strong psychological well-being indicators alongside notable physiological markers of late-night activity and reduced sleep duration. The robust self-reported measures of low anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and high happiness are powerful protective factors against perceived stress, and their correlations with PSS strongly suggest a lower stress burden. While the objective sleep patterns (short duration, very late onset) and the extreme late-night heart rate elevation are noteworthy, they appear to occur within a highly structured and resilient individual. Given that the mental health indicators are overwhelmingly favorable and directly associated with lower perceived stress, they are weighted more heavily in this holistic assessment than the physiological patterns which, while unusual, do not universally correlate with higher *perceived* stress in this population. Therefore, the overall evidence suggests that this participant's experience of stress is likely to be lower or average compared to their peers.

The participant presents a mixed profile, demonstrating resilience in self-reported psychological well-being while exhibiting significant physiological markers of chronic arousal and circadian dysregulation. Self-report data indicates lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CESD score 6.0, Z-score -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI score 27.0, Z-score -1.41), suggesting a generally positive affective state in these domains. Self-esteem is notably higher than the population average (score 43.0, Z-score 0.68), and academic performance, as reflected by consistently high GPAs, further supports effective functioning. Health satisfaction is near the population average (Z-score 0.13), and trust in others is also typical (Z-score -0.46). However, self-reported happiness is slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.53). Overall, the participant's self-reported psychological traits largely suggest an individual with robust coping mechanisms and low levels of common distress symptoms.

In contrast to the participant's self-reported psychological well-being, objective physiological data derived from wearables points to a state of elevated cardiovascular arousal and dysregulated circadian rhythmicity. The participant's resting heart rate (75.5 bpm) is significantly higher than the study population average (Z-score 2.06), and the overall mesor (mean heart rate) is also elevated (82.2 bpm, Z-score 1.13). These metrics are positively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm exhibits considerable instability and fragmentation. Interdaily Stability is markedly low (0.19, Z-score -1.81), indicating inconsistent day-to-day patterns, while Intradaily Variability is high (0.71, Z-score 1.16), suggesting a fragmented rhythm within days. The autocorrelation at 24 hours is very low (0.1, Z-score -1.87), denoting a weak 24-hour periodicity. The amplitude of the rhythm is considerably reduced (5.05, Z-score -1.85), signifying a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rate values throughout the day. Collectively, these circadian metrics imply a physiological system operating with reduced regularity and diminished daily fluctuation, which are frequently associated with chronic stress and potential health disruptions.

Sleep patterns present a nuanced picture. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8). Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is robust at 8 hours 3 minutes (Z-score 1.08), exceeding the population average. However, other objective sleep parameters indicate potential areas of irregularity. The standard deviation of sleep start time is slightly elevated (96 minutes, Z-score 0.28), suggesting less consistent bedtimes, and the participant engages in more daily naps than the average (Z-score 0.82). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reinforces the physiological arousal during rest periods; specifically, during early morning hours (2-7 AM), when heart rate is expected to be at its lowest, the observed negative deviations from the mesor are relatively smaller (indicated by positive Z-scores for these deviations), implying that the heart rate during these typical deep sleep phases is comparatively higher than typical for the population. This sustained higher heart rate during rest, combined with the elevated resting heart rate and disrupted circadian rhythms, further supports a state of chronic physiological activation.

Behavioral habits reflect a balance of engagement in health-promoting and potentially stress-inducing activities. The participant engages in exercise with others and alone approximately 1-2 times a week, with slightly above-average frequencies for these activities. Social engagement is notably high, with 2-3 hours spent socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95), a potentially protective factor against stress. Conversely, alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor) is also reported 1-2 times a week, with Z-scores slightly above average (1.01 and 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Screen time for watching TV/videos (31 minutes/hour, Z-score 0.64) and engaging in a sedentary hobby (31 minutes/hour, Z-score 0.82) are also above average. These behavioral patterns suggest a social and active individual, but also one who engages in above-average alcohol consumption and sedentary screen-based activities, which may have variable impacts on overall well-being and stress levels.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence supporting a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) primarily stems from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD) and trait anxiety (STAI), coupled with above-average self-esteem and consistently high academic performance. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as good, and objective sleep duration is robust. High engagement in socializing with friends is also a factor typically associated with lower stress. These indicators suggest psychological resilience and effective coping on a conscious level.

Conversely, significant evidence supports a high PSS score (top 50th percentile), predominantly from the objective physiological data. The participant exhibits a markedly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 2.06) and an elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.13), both strong physiological markers of chronic arousal. Furthermore, circadian rhythm metrics indicate substantial dysregulation, characterized by low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.81), high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.16), low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.87), and reduced amplitude (Z-score -1.85). These parameters collectively suggest a physiological system under considerable strain and operating with diminished regulatory capacity. The analysis of hourly heart rate further indicates that heart rate remains relatively elevated even during typical sleep hours. While objective sleep duration is high, increased variability in sleep start time and more frequent napping also point to underlying sleep irregularities. The observed correlations between these physiological markers and PSS consistently indicate that the participant's values for these metrics align with higher perceived stress. The discrepancy between self-reported psychological well-being and these compelling objective physiological indicators of stress is a critical factor. Physiological responses are less subject to conscious bias and often reflect a deeper, systemic stress load that may not be fully acknowledged or perceived as emotional distress.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the participant's self-reported psychological and subjective sleep data suggest lower perceived stress, the robust and consistent physiological markers of chronic cardiovascular arousal and profound circadian rhythm dysregulation provide compelling evidence of a significant underlying stress burden. The objective physiological state, including an exceptionally high resting heart rate and disrupted biological rhythms, reflects a body operating under sustained stress, which is highly correlated with perceived stress, even if not consciously expressed as anxiety or depression. Given the strength and objectivity of the physiological evidence, it is highly probable that the participant experiences a perceived stress level that places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

88185,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant demonstrates a profile characterized by general psychological well-being, robust physiological rhythms, and active lifestyle behaviors, alongside specific challenges related to sleep. Self-report measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 7.0 (Z-score = -0.66) classifying the participant as ""Not depressed,"" and low trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 29.0 (Z-score = -1.22) classifying them as ""not anxious."" Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (Score 44.0, Z-score = 0.82) and notably high current happiness (Score 5.0, Z-score = 1.64). Health satisfaction is slightly below the population mean (Score 3.56, Z-score = -0.53), and trust in others is above average (Score 3.67, Z-score = 0.83). These self-reported psychological states generally suggest a resilient individual with a positive outlook.

Despite the positive self-reported psychological state, the participant exhibits some challenges in sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies subjective sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" However, it is noteworthy that this score's Z-score of -0.33 indicates that, relative to the study population, the participant experiences slightly *less* subjective sleep disturbance than the average. Objective sleep data from the wearable device reveal a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score = -0.7), which is shorter than the population average. Sleep duration consistency is high, with a relatively low standard deviation of 62 minutes (Z-score = -0.87), implying a regular, albeit short, sleep schedule. The median sleep start time is notably late, at 02:25 AM, though the variability in sleep start time is close to the population mean (Standard Deviation = 88 minutes, Z-score = 0.11). The absence of daily naps (Mean Daily Naps = 0.0, Z-score = -0.86) further characterizes this consistent nocturnal sleep pattern.

Physiological data derived from heart rate reveal a well-structured circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability value of 0.57 (Z-score = 1.33) is significantly above average and negatively correlated with PSS, indicating a highly regular daily pattern in heart rate. The Amplitude of 14.05 (Z-score = 1.06) is also above average and negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting a robust difference between peak and trough heart rate levels, reflecting a strong physiological rhythm. Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -0.32) is slightly below average, consistent with the observed stability. The Acrophase, indicating the time of peak physiological activity, occurs at 5:00 PM. The resting heart rate of 57.3 bpm (Z-score = -0.1) is healthy and slightly below the population mean. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with significant drops during early morning hours (e.g., -26.06 bpm at 6-7 AM, Z-score = -1.21) and peaks during the afternoon (e.g., 14.93 bpm at 1-2 PM, Z-score = 1.11), consistent with normal daily activity and recovery, further supporting a regulated physiological system.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant exhibits a highly disciplined and academically successful lifestyle. Academic performance is consistently strong and improving, culminating in a 4.0 GPA in Fall 2016. The participant reports no substance use across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs), with associated Z-scores significantly below the population mean. Exercise habits include frequent solitary exercise, ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score = 1.07), suggesting an independent approach to physical activity. Recreational habits are characterized by extensive listening to music (more than 4 hours daily, Z-score = 2.06), moderate socializing with friends (2-3 hours daily, Z-score = 0.95), and relatively low engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos or playing video games. This overall behavioral profile indicates a highly engaged, self-directed individual who actively manages their time and well-being.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data for evidence regarding the participant's perceived stress level (PSS score):

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The strongest evidence for a low or median PSS score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. They report low depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.66, correlated 0.28 with PSS), low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.22, correlated 0.31 with PSS), high self-esteem (Z-score 0.82, correlated -0.15 with PSS), and notably high current happiness (Z-score 1.64, correlated -0.19 with PSS). These indicators are all strongly suggestive of lower perceived stress.
Furthermore, physiological data indicate a robust and regular circadian rhythm in heart rate, with significantly high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.33) and Amplitude (Z-score 1.06), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.11 and r = -0.16, respectively). High autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.56) also points to regularity and is negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.17). These physiological markers are generally associated with better health and lower stress.
Behaviorally, the participant's consistent and frequent solitary exercise (Z-score 1.07), complete abstinence from substance use (e.g., Beer Usage Z-score -1.12), and strong academic performance (high GPA) suggest effective coping strategies and a well-managed lifestyle that would typically buffer against high stress. Many of these positive behaviors have weak or negative correlations with PSS.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (top 50th percentile):**
The primary evidence that might suggest a higher PSS score is the PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Score 6.0). Poor sleep quality is a known stressor and symptom of stress, and PSQI score is positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.28). Additionally, the objective median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score -0.7) is shorter than average, and chronic sleep deprivation can contribute to perceived stress. The somewhat late acrophase (5:00 PM) for peak physiological activity could also be indicative of a potentially misaligned rhythm, which might contribute to stress. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), and lower health satisfaction has a weak negative correlation with PSS, meaning it might slightly contribute to higher PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification from the PSQI is a point of concern, its Z-score of -0.33 indicates that *relative to the study population*, this participant's subjective sleep disturbance is actually *less* than average. Coupled with objective sleep data showing consistency (low sleep duration standard deviation) despite short duration and late start, the overall impact on PSS may be less pronounced than the ""Disturbed Sleep"" label alone suggests.
The overwhelming balance of evidence points towards a participant with relatively low perceived stress. The strong indicators are the exceptionally positive self-reported mental health (very low anxiety and depressive symptoms, very high self-esteem and happiness), combined with robust physiological markers of circadian regularity that are negatively correlated with PSS. The participant's active, disciplined, and substance-free lifestyle, alongside academic success, further supports a profile unlikely to be in the top half of the PSS distribution. The areas of concern (sleep disturbance, short sleep duration) are present, but their relative impact is mitigated by the overall positive and resilient profile across multiple domains.

Therefore, based on the holistic analysis, the participant is most likely in the bottom 50% of the study population with regards to their PSS score.

35344,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile reveals significant indicators of distress. Notably, they exhibit substantially elevated levels of trait anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI score of 62.0, which places them more than two standard deviations above the population mean (Z-score = 2.05) and is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). Similarly, depressive symptoms are clinically significant, with a CESD score of 28.0 (Z-score = 1.53), also positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28). These findings are compounded by lower self-esteem (Z-score = -1.57) and lower self-reported happiness (Z-score = -1.61), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, indicating that lower values in these domains are associated with higher stress. While health satisfaction is near the population average and trust in others is notably high (Z-score = 1.79), these factors do not appear to mitigate the overall pattern of psychological vulnerability suggested by the other metrics.

Sleep patterns present a complex picture. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score = 1.05), suggesting poor subjective sleep quality, which is generally associated with higher stress. However, objective wearable data indicate an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 47 minutes (Z-score = 0.74) and relatively consistent sleep duration (standard deviation of 92 minutes, Z-score = -0.21) and start times (standard deviation of 61 minutes, Z-score = -0.48). This discrepancy suggests that while the participant obtains adequate and regular sleep in terms of duration, the subjective experience of that sleep quality is poor, potentially contributing to perceived stress.

Regarding daily activities and lifestyle, the participant demonstrates a mixed pattern. They engage in exercise with high frequency, particularly alone (Z-score = 1.07) and through sports (Z-score = 0.91), which can be a positive coping mechanism. However, engagement in most other recreational activities is notably low, especially socializing with friends (Z-score = -1.41) and reading (Z-score = -0.67), while internet usage and listening to music are also below average. This pattern suggests a potential lack of diverse coping strategies or social support engagement. Concurrently, alcohol consumption, for both beer (Z-score = 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score = 0.94), is higher than the population average. Academically, a consistent decline in GPA across semesters may indicate increasing academic pressure or a response to overall psychological strain. The participant's Body Mass Index (28.97) falls within the overweight category.

Physiological data from wearables reveal an elevated state of arousal. The participant's Resting Heart Rate (63.8 bpm, Z-score = 0.67) and Mesor (average heart rate, 78.01 bpm, Z-score = 0.56) are both higher than the population average and are positively correlated with perceived stress, indicating a generally heightened cardiovascular state. Circadian rhythm metrics show slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.25) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.31), suggesting some regularity in the heart rate rhythm. However, the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a sustained period of elevated activity during typical waking hours, with pronounced peaks occurring around 10-11 AM (Z-score = 1.06) and between 3-5 PM (Z-scores of 0.72 and 0.67), consistent with a relatively late acrophase at 3:51 PM. This pattern indicates persistent physiological activation that extends into the late afternoon, potentially contributing to the participant's perceived stress load.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

The overall evidence strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the top 50% of the study population.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

*   **Significant Psychological Distress:** The participant exhibits markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 2.05, positive correlation with PSS) and clinically significant depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score = 1.53, positive correlation with PSS). These are the most substantial indicators of psychological burden in the dataset.
*   **Negative Affective States:** Lower self-esteem (Z-score = -1.57) and lower self-reported happiness (Z-score = -1.61) are both negatively correlated with PSS, meaning these lower values are associated with higher perceived stress.
*   **Poor Subjective Sleep Quality:** Despite objectively adequate sleep duration, the PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score = 1.05) indicates significant subjective sleep disturbance, a common correlate and consequence of elevated stress.
*   **Elevated Physiological Arousal:** The participant's higher Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = 0.67, positive correlation with PSS) and elevated Mesor (Z-score = 0.56, positive correlation with PSS) point to a higher baseline physiological stress response. The pattern of hourly heart rate also indicates sustained daytime arousal.
*   **Behavioral Indicators:** The declining GPA trend, higher-than-average alcohol consumption, and significantly lower engagement in social activities (Z-score = -1.41) are all behaviors commonly associated with or exacerbated by elevated stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

*   **Adequate Objective Sleep Duration:** The participant's median sleep duration is above average (Z-score = 0.74). However, this is contradicted by their subjective report of disturbed sleep.
*   **Regularity in Circadian Rhythm:** Slightly above-average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation suggest some consistency in daily heart rate patterns, which could, in isolation, be associated with lower stress. However, these are overshadowed by the elevated baseline heart rate metrics.
*   **High Exercise Frequency:** The participant engages in exercise frequently. While exercise can be a stress reducer, its correlation with PSS in this dataset is negligible or slightly positive, suggesting it may not fully mitigate stress for this individual or could be a coping mechanism for existing stress.

Considering the cumulative weight of the evidence, particularly the highly elevated psychological distress (anxiety, depression), poor subjective sleep quality, and objective physiological markers of arousal, the participant's perceived stress level is most likely substantially elevated relative to their peers.

31175,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a nuanced psychological profile. Self-report measures indicate below-average depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.13), suggesting a general resilience in these domains. Concurrently, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.4) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.63). However, a contrasting finding is the below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), which suggests an underlying level of dissatisfaction or reduced subjective well-being despite the absence of elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, engaging in solitary exercise and sports with frequencies significantly above the population average (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58 respectively). While this active engagement is typically associated with stress reduction, they report no exercise with others, indicating a preference for individual physical activity. Recreational substance use, specifically beer and wine/liquor consumption, is moderate (1-2 times a week, with Z-scores around 1.0), which is above average for the population, though illicit drug use is absent. Daily recreation includes substantial time spent socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74), alongside above-average engagement with media like TV/videos, internet, and music. Despite high social engagement, its correlation with PSS is slightly positive (0.06), suggesting that for this individual, increased socializing might not universally serve as a stress buffer, or could even be a response to stress.

A critical aspect of this participant's profile lies in their sleep patterns. Fitbit data reveals an exceptionally long median sleep duration of 9 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score 2.96). However, this is coupled with an extremely high standard deviation in sleep duration (249 minutes, Z-score 3.37), indicating profound day-to-day inconsistency in the amount of sleep obtained. This objective variability is corroborated by a self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0, which classifies their subjective sleep as 'Disturbed Sleep' and places them above the population average (Z-score 0.59). Despite an average variability in sleep start time, the combination of very long but highly irregular sleep duration and disturbed subjective quality strongly suggests compromised sleep health, which is a common correlate of elevated perceived stress.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a significantly lower mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.28) compared to the study population, with an average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.04). Their circadian rhythm in heart rate, while demonstrating a typical afternoon acrophase (3:34 PM), shows slightly reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.16) and markedly reduced intradaily variability (Z-score -1.73). The low intradaily variability suggests a comparatively stable, less dynamic heart rate response throughout the day. While this could imply a calm physiological state, its positive correlation with PSS implies that *lower* variability might be associated with *lower* stress. However, an examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pattern of relatively elevated heart rates during specific early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 am), which display positive Z-scores and positive correlations with PSS. This subtle but consistent physiological arousal during periods typically associated with deep rest could indicate compromised physiological recovery or heightened sympathetic activity during sleep, aligning with the self-reported and objectively measured sleep disturbances.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant's self-reported psychological traits largely suggest a profile associated with lower perceived stress. They exhibit below-average depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.13). Furthermore, their above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.4) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.63) are typically protective factors against high stress. Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle with frequent exercise and sports, which are generally associated with stress reduction. Physiologically, a lower overall average heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.28) and a significantly low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.73), which correlates positively with PSS, could suggest a more stable physiological state that might translate to lower perceived stress.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
Despite the aforementioned strengths, several significant factors point towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53), indicating a potential underlying dissatisfaction or distress. Most compellingly, their sleep profile reveals substantial disturbances: a 'Disturbed Sleep' classification via PSQI (Z-score 0.59) and, critically, extremely high variability in objective sleep duration (Z-score 3.37 for sleep duration standard deviation). Such profound inconsistency in sleep, alongside poorer subjective quality, is a robust indicator of poor sleep health and is frequently associated with heightened perceived stress. Physiologically, the relatively elevated heart rate observed during early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 am, positive Z-scores and positive correlations with PSS) suggests a pattern of physiological arousal during typical rest periods, which aligns with disrupted sleep and a potential for increased stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant benefits from lower self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, along with a physically active lifestyle and generally healthy self-esteem, the overall picture strongly suggests that these protective factors are substantially undermined by profound sleep disturbances. The combination of subjectively 'Disturbed Sleep' and objectively extreme variability in sleep duration is a potent indicator of compromised well-being and is highly predictive of elevated stress. This objective and subjective sleep impairment is further supported by subtle physiological arousal during periods of rest. Given that chronic sleep disturbance and inconsistency are major contributors to perceived stress and can undermine overall psychological resilience, the negative impact of these sleep issues likely outweighs the positive psychological and behavioral indicators. Therefore, the participant is more likely to experience a higher level of perceived stress compared to the general study population.

58793,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and physiological profile characterized by a blend of robust behavioral coping mechanisms alongside notable internal vulnerabilities and significant physiological arousal patterns. Psychologically, the individual reports a higher-than-average level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46, classified as 'anxious'), coupled with moderately lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53). Despite these indicators of internal emotional vulnerability, depressive symptoms are below average (CESD Z-score -0.34), and the participant maintains consistently high academic performance (GPA ranging from 3.69 to 3.8). Furthermore, a high level of satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3) and above-average trust in others (Z-score 0.83) suggest areas of personal strength and well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a highly active and socially engaged lifestyle. They engage in frequent exercise both alone and with others (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.23, respectively, both ""Three times a week or more""), and participate in sports regularly (Z-score 0.91, ""1-2 times a week""). Socializing with friends is a prominent daily activity, consuming ""3-4 hours"" and registering a very high Z-score of 1.74. Conversely, the participant reports minimal engagement in many common sedentary leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, or reading (all ""Do not do"" with notably low Z-scores). Alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, is reported at an above-average frequency (""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. These high levels of physical activity and social connection typically serve as strong protective factors against stress.

Sleep patterns reveal a substantial quantity of sleep, with a median duration of 9 hours and 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than the population average (Z-score 2.3). Subjective sleep quality is reported as 'Good Sleep' (PSQI Z-score -0.8), indicating low perceived sleep disturbance. However, despite the ample sleep duration, there is above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.46, 104 minutes standard deviation), suggesting an inconsistent bedtime routine that could potentially disrupt circadian alignment. The participant reports minimal napping.

Physiologically, heart rate data from wearable devices provides insight into daily arousal patterns and circadian structure. The participant demonstrates a robust underlying circadian rhythm, evidenced by a high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06) and a strong amplitude in heart rate variation (Z-score 1.0), which generally indicates good physiological regulation. However, the mean heart rate (Mesor) is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.77), and intradaily variability (IV) is higher than average (Z-score 0.46), suggesting greater fragmentation or less stability in daily physiological activity. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a particularly salient pattern: an exceptionally pronounced spike in heart rate during the 8-9 AM hour (deviation 30.3, Z-score 3.52), indicating a significant and rapid physiological activation at the start of the day. This heightened arousal continues with other notable elevations in the afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM deviation 18.01, Z-score 2.03; 4-5 PM deviation 22.3, Z-score 2.0). These pronounced and sustained periods of elevated heart rate during typical academic or activity hours suggest a high degree of physiological engagement or reactivity to daily demands, contrasting with generally average physiological quietude during nocturnal hours.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators that would typically be associated with lower perceived stress. Their subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI Z-score -0.8), and objectively, they obtain a significantly long median sleep duration (9 hours 2 minutes, Z-score 2.3). High levels of physical activity, both alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 1.23), as well as participation in sports (Z-score 0.91), are well-established stress-buffering behaviors. Furthermore, the participant's extensive social engagement (socializing 3-4 hours daily, Z-score 1.74) is a potent protective factor against stress. Psychologically, depressive symptoms are low (CESD Z-score -0.34), and there is high overall satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3). From a circadian perspective, the robust 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06) and amplitude (Z-score 1.0) of their heart rate rhythm suggest a stable and well-structured physiological clock, which is typically associated with better health outcomes and lower stress, as supported by their negative correlations with PSS (-0.17 and -0.16 respectively).

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several factors point towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The participant reports above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46), classified as 'anxious,' which positively correlates with PSS (0.31). This is compounded by lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and slightly lower reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), both of which typically correlate negatively with PSS, implying higher stress in this case. Physiologically, the heart rate data reveals significant patterns of arousal. The mean heart rate (Mesor, Z-score 0.77) is elevated, and intradaily variability (IV, Z-score 0.46) is higher than average, positively correlating with PSS (0.16). Most notably, the hourly heart rate data shows extremely pronounced physiological reactivity, particularly a highly elevated deviation from mesor in the 8-9 AM hour (Z-score 3.52) and sustained elevations throughout the afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM Z-score 2.03, 4-5 PM Z-score 2.0). These strong heart rate responses suggest a system under considerable physiological demand or stress during daily activities. While the participant engages in robust coping behaviors like long sleep duration, the above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.46) indicates an inconsistent routine that could undermine optimal circadian synchronization.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a complex interplay of strong external coping resources (high physical activity, social support, extensive sleep quantity) and robust underlying physiological rhythmicity (high autocorrelation, amplitude). However, the internal psychological vulnerability to anxiety, combined with lower self-esteem and happiness, suggests a predisposition to experience higher perceived stress. This internal state is strongly corroborated by the marked physiological arousal patterns, particularly the exceptionally high heart rate spikes during the morning and afternoon, which indicate a substantial and sustained physiological response to daily demands. While the participant's lifestyle includes many healthy habits that act as buffers, the magnitude of the physiological reactivity and the self-reported anxiety and lower well-being suggest that these coping mechanisms may be actively engaged to manage an already elevated baseline of perceived stress. Weighing the evidence, the direct psychological indicators of anxiety and lower well-being, coupled with the highly significant and sustained physiological arousal patterns, outweigh the protective behavioral factors in predicting perceived stress. Thus, despite healthy behaviors, the internal experience and physiological burden likely place this participant in the higher range of perceived stress within the study population.

96689,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a nuanced psychological profile characterized by both indicators of vulnerability and resilience. While reporting relatively low depressive symptoms, as evidenced by a CES-D Z-score of -0.76, they exhibit above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.56), classified as ""anxious,"" and below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53). Self-esteem is slightly above the population average, and trust levels are typical. A notable area of concern, however, is a significantly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.61), which may contribute to a chronic sense of unease despite its weak correlation with perceived stress. This combination suggests a psychological predisposition to experience anxiety, yet without pervasive depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains healthy habits regarding substance use, abstaining from all reported substances. However, a significant gap exists in physical activity, with no reported engagement in any form of exercise, placing them markedly below the population average (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93). The absence of exercise is frequently associated with poorer stress management and increased physiological strain. In contrast, the participant demonstrates robust social engagement, spending ""2-3 hours"" socializing with friends, reflecting a Z-score of 0.95, significantly above the population mean. They also engage in reading, albeit for ""15 minutes or less,"" which is slightly above average and negatively correlated with perceived stress. Minimal engagement in screen-based recreation, alongside above-average internet usage, completes a picture of recreation habits that emphasize social connection and less passive consumption. Academic performance, with GPAs consistently above 3.5, suggests effective cognitive and organizational skills.

A striking feature of the participant's profile is their remarkably consistent and generally healthy sleep and circadian rhythms, which serve as strong protective factors against perceived stress. Their median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes is slightly above the population average. More importantly, both sleep duration (Z-score -1.42) and sleep start times (Z-score -1.19) exhibit significantly less variability than their peers, indicating a highly regular sleep schedule. Despite a PSQI score of 6.0 classifying their sleep as ""disturbed,"" the Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their subjective sleep quality is comparatively better than the average study participant. Heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics further reinforce this pattern of regularity: interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75) is higher than average, and the 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98) is exceptionally strong, reflecting a highly predictable daily rhythm. The heart rate amplitude is also notably high (Z-score 1.36), signifying a clear physiological distinction between active and rest phases. While intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z-score 0.74), suggesting some fragmentation within daily activity, the overall consistency in sleep and circadian patterns strongly suggests a well-regulated physiological system conducive to stress resilience.

Physiological arousal patterns further elaborate on this regulated state. Hourly heart rate data reveal a robust and dynamic daily rhythm, characterized by significant drops during nighttime hours (e.g., -20.28 to -24.78 beats per minute below mesor from 2-7 AM), indicative of healthy physiological recovery during sleep. During waking hours, particularly late morning (11 AM - 1 PM) and evening (6-9 PM), the participant exhibits notably higher heart rate activity compared to the population average (e.g., Z-scores up to 1.41 in late morning and 1.62 in the evening). These pronounced physiological peaks and troughs, coupled with negative correlations between activity levels during these peaks and perceived stress, suggest a pattern of active engagement rather than chronic, undifferentiated physiological arousal. While the resting heart rate (58.8 bpm, Z-score 0.08) and mesor (Z-score 0.52) are slightly above the population average, potentially indicating a higher baseline arousal, this is contextualized by the overall robust and adaptive circadian and activity patterns.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High Perceived Stress (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits several self-reported psychological characteristics that could contribute to higher perceived stress. Their elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.56, positively correlated with PSS) and below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53, negatively correlated with PSS) suggest a predisposition towards experiencing psychological distress. Behavioral patterns, specifically a complete lack of exercise engagement (significantly negative Z-scores across all exercise categories), represent a risk factor for elevated stress, as physical activity is a known stress buffer. Physiologically, slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.74, positively correlated with PSS) and a resting heart rate slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.08, positively correlated with PSS) could point to subtle increases in physiological arousal or fragmentation within daily rhythms. Furthermore, significantly low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.61) might act as a chronic stressor.

**Evidence for Low or Median Perceived Stress (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, a substantial amount of data points towards a relatively low or average level of perceived stress, or robust protective mechanisms. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -0.76, positively correlated with PSS, meaning lower symptoms indicate lower stress). Their sleep patterns are exceptionally consistent; both sleep duration and sleep start times show significantly less variability than the study population (Z-scores of -1.42 and -1.19 respectively). Despite a clinical classification of ""disturbed sleep"" by PSQI score, their subjective sleep quality is *better* than the population average (PSQI Z-score -0.33). Physiologically, circadian rhythms are remarkably robust, characterized by higher-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75), very high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98), and a significantly high heart rate amplitude (Z-score 1.36), all of which are negatively correlated with PSS and indicate a well-regulated system. Behavioral strengths include high social engagement (Z-score 0.95), engagement in reading (Z-score 0.32, negatively correlated with PSS), and complete abstinence from substance use. The detailed hourly heart rate patterns also demonstrate healthy, dynamic physiological responses to activity and rest, rather than chronic low-grade arousal.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant acknowledges subjective feelings of anxiety and lower happiness, the overwhelming evidence from their physiological and behavioral data suggests a strong capacity for stress regulation and resilience. The exceptionally regular sleep and robust circadian rhythms, as measured by multiple wearable metrics, are powerful indicators of a well-functioning physiological system that typically buffers against the impact of stress. These fundamental biological rhythms are more regulated than the majority of the student population. Coupled with healthy social engagement and abstinence from substances, these protective factors likely mitigate the subjective experience of stress. Despite the lack of exercise, the overall picture indicates that the participant possesses substantial resources—both internal physiological stability and external social support—to cope with academic and life stressors. Therefore, it is most likely that their perceived stress level, when holistically assessed, falls into the lower half of the study population distribution.

33657,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"This participant's psychological and behavioral profile presents a complex interaction of psychological traits, lifestyle habits, and physiological markers, offering insights into their perceived stress levels.

**Psychological Well-being and Mental Health**
The participant exhibits a mixed psychological profile. While classified as experiencing depressive symptoms with a CES-D score of 16.0, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.28) and positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.28), their trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is below average (Score 37.0, Z-score -0.43) and classified as ""not anxious."" This suggests that while they may experience some depressive symptomatology, chronic anxiety is not a prominent feature. Concurrently, self-esteem (Score 41.0, Z-score 0.4) and self-reported happiness (Score 4.0, Z-score 0.55) are both above average, and both are negatively correlated with perceived stress (r=-0.15 and r=-0.19, respectively), indicating these positive attributes may act as protective factors. Trust in others (Score 3.5, Z-score 0.5) and satisfaction with physical health (Score 4.56, Z-score 0.22) are also above average. This suggests a relatively positive outlook on interpersonal relationships and personal health, which generally aligns with lower perceived stress.

**Sleep Patterns**
Sleep quality presents a contrast between subjective experience and objective regularity. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 6.0, although their Z-score of -0.33 indicates they perceive less sleep disturbance than the average participant. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours 5 minutes, which is close to the population average (Z-score -0.13). Notably, the variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation 63 minutes, Z-score -0.85) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation 64 minutes, Z-score -0.42) are significantly lower than the population average. This indicates a high degree of regularity in their sleep schedule, which is generally associated with better sleep health and lower stress. However, the participant reports significantly more frequent daily naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.26, Z-score 2.23), a behavior that shows a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (r=0.14), potentially suggesting daytime fatigue or compensatory napping despite a regular nighttime schedule.

**Circadian Rhythm and General Physiological Activity**
Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate monitors reveal a mixed pattern of activity and regulation. The participant's resting heart rate of 51.2 bpm is significantly below the population average (Z-score -0.83), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, and positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.14), suggesting a lower resting heart rate is associated with lower stress. Analysis of heart rate-based circadian rhythms shows slightly below-average interdaily stability (0.35, Z-score -0.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.28, Z-score -0.36), suggesting a somewhat less robust day-to-day rhythm and weaker 24-hour periodicity. However, these metrics are negatively correlated with PSS, meaning lower values could imply higher PSS. Conversely, intradaily variability is notably higher than average (0.65, Z-score 0.74), indicating more fragmentation or rapid changes within the daily heart rate rhythm, which is positively correlated with perceived stress (r=0.16). The mesor (mean heart rate) and amplitude of the circadian rhythm are significantly lower than average (Mesor 63.24, Z-score -1.46; Amplitude 7.12, Z-score -1.18). A lower mesor aligns with the low resting heart rate, and a lower amplitude, which is negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.17), could suggest a less pronounced physiological response or a more subdued daily fluctuation, potentially buffering against stress. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs in the mid-afternoon at 3:16 PM.

**Hourly Heart Rate Deviation and Lifestyle Habits**
An examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrates distinct patterns of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits pronounced decreases in heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM, with positive Z-scores indicating larger negative deviations than average), reflecting deep rest. Upon waking, there is a sharp increase in heart rate, reaching a significant peak above the population average between 10-11 AM (deviation 23.67, Z-score 2.71), suggesting a period of high physiological arousal or activity during this late morning phase. Following this, there are several periods in the afternoon and evening (e.g., 1-2 PM, 5-6 PM, 7-8 PM, 8-9 PM, 9-10 PM) where heart rate deviation is notably lower than average (negative Z-scores, particularly Z-score -2.26 for 7-8 PM), indicating a comparatively faster or more pronounced return to a lower arousal state in the evenings compared to peers. In terms of lifestyle, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for beer and wine/liquor, Z-scores around 1.0) and exercises alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32), both close to or slightly above average with negligible correlations to PSS. Recreational habits are characterized by very high engagement in sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours, Z-score 3.19), which is negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.05), and higher-than-average internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), positively correlated with PSS (r=0.11). Conversely, engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and reading is notably low.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the cumulative evidence guided by Z-scores and correlations with PSS. The population median PSS score is 22.0.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the top 50th percentile (higher perceived stress):**
The participant reports depressive symptoms (CES-D score of 16.0, Z-score 0.28), which is positively correlated with PSS (r=0.28). Wearable data indicates higher than average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 0.74), suggesting a fragmented physiological rhythm, which is positively correlated with PSS (r=0.16). Additionally, the participant engages in significantly more frequent napping than average (Z-score 2.23), a behavior positively correlated with PSS (r=0.14). Lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.49) is also associated with higher PSS (r=-0.12). Internet usage is above average (Z-score 0.85), with a positive, albeit weak, correlation with PSS (r=0.11). A notable physiological peak in late morning (10-11 AM, Z-score 2.71 for HR deviation) suggests periods of intense physiological arousal.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the bottom 50th percentile (lower or median perceived stress):**
Conversely, several factors suggest lower perceived stress. The participant reports below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43) and above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.4) and happiness (Z-score 0.55), all of which are correlated with lower PSS (STAI r=0.31, Self-Esteem r=-0.15, Happiness r=-0.19). Physiologically, a significantly lower resting heart rate (Z-score -0.83), lower Mesor (Z-score -1.46), and lower amplitude (Z-score -1.18) are consistent with lower stress (RHR r=0.14, Mesor r=0.06, Amplitude r=-0.17). Objective sleep regularity is notably high, with significantly lower standard deviations in sleep duration (Z-score -0.85) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.42), both positively correlated with PSS (r=0.14 and r=0.17, respectively), meaning lower variability implies lower stress. While subjectively reporting disturbed sleep, the PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates they perceive less disturbance than the average participant. Furthermore, the participant exhibits significantly lower physiological arousal in the evenings compared to peers (e.g., 7-8 PM HR deviation Z-score -2.26). Notably, very high engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 3.19) is weakly negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.05), suggesting this activity may buffer stress for this individual.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence for lower perceived stress appears more substantial and consistent across domains. The participant demonstrates strong psychological resources (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness) and robust physiological indicators of good regulation and low baseline arousal (low resting HR, low mean HR, pronounced evening HR recovery). The objective markers of sleep regularity are also strongly indicative of better stress management. While depressive symptoms, higher intradaily variability, and frequent napping suggest some stressors, these are counterbalanced by a broader pattern of resilience and physiological calm. The magnitude of Z-scores for several ""low PSS"" indicators (e.g., RHR, Mesor, STAI, Sleep Duration SD) is quite pronounced. Therefore, the overall balance of evidence suggests the participant's perceived stress level is likely to be lower than average for the study population.

36117,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"This participant exhibits a complex psychophysiological and behavioral profile, characterized by strong psychological well-being indicators alongside signs of physiological arousal and perceived sleep disturbance.

**Psychological and Behavioral Profile:**
The participant's self-reported psychological state suggests robust coping resources and positive self-perception. They report notably high levels of self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) and current happiness (Z-score 1.64), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, indicating a protective psychological buffer. Trait anxiety levels are below average (Z-score -0.33), classified as ""not anxious,"" further contributing to a resilient psychological profile. Trust in others is also high (Z-score 1.79). However, depressive symptoms are present, with a CES-D score of 16, classifying them as ""depressed,"" although their Z-score of 0.28 suggests these symptoms are at the lower end of the clinically relevant range. This indicates some psychological strain despite overall positive subjective well-being. Health satisfaction is reported as below average (Z-score -0.62).

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active social life, engaging in exercise with others three times a week or more (Z-score 1.23) and socializing with friends for more than four hours daily (Z-score 2.53). This high level of social engagement could serve as a significant stress buffer. However, the participant reports spending extensive time on internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score 3.19), potentially indicating a lifestyle with prolonged periods of inactivity, though the weak negative correlation between sedentary hobby time and PSS suggests that for this individual, these activities might be perceived as relaxing. Substance usage patterns are moderate to low, with recreational and non-prescribed drug use being absent.

**Sleep Patterns:**
Sleep data presents a dichotomy between subjective experience and objective measurement. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality via the PSQI (score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), indicating clinically significant sleep difficulties. Yet, wearable data indicates a slightly above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes (Z-score 0.58). Consistency in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.18) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.37) is near the population average, and there is no reported napping behavior (Z-score -0.86). This suggests that while objectively the participant achieves adequate and relatively consistent sleep durations, their subjective experience of sleep quality is poor, which can itself be a source of stress or reflect underlying psychological tension.

**Physiological Indicators:**
Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveals a state of elevated baseline arousal. The participant's resting heart rate (72.0 bpm) is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.65) relative to the study population, and this metric positively correlates with perceived stress. Similarly, the Mesor (mean heart rate across the day) is high (88.9 bpm, Z-score 2.04), indicating a generally elevated cardiovascular activity level. Despite this, the participant exhibits a highly regular and structured circadian rhythm. Measures such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.16), Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.94, indicating very low within-day variability), and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.23) all suggest a robust and predictable daily heart rate pattern. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also high (Z-score 1.58), reflecting a significant difference between peak and trough heart rates, further indicating a well-defined physiological rhythm. The acrophase (peak heart rate) occurs at 5:06 PM, consistent with typical afternoon cardiovascular activity peaks. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show sustained elevation throughout the afternoon and evening hours, with several points exceeding one standard deviation above the population mean (e.g., 2-3 PM, 7-9 PM), further supporting a pattern of sustained physiological arousal during waking hours.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score:**
To determine whether the participant’s perceived stress level (PSS) falls into the top or bottom half of the study population, we synthesize the evidence considering the magnitude of Z-scores and correlations with PSS.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the Top 50% (higher perceived stress):**
The participant exhibits significant physiological markers associated with higher stress. Their resting heart rate (Z=1.65) and Mesor (Z=2.04) are substantially elevated and show positive correlations with PSS, indicating a baseline state of physiological arousal. Self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score 8.0, Z=0.59) is a direct indicator of stress or its consequences, though its population correlation with PSS is reported as 0.0, suggesting it may not be a linear predictor in this specific population context. Mild depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.28) are present and positively correlated with PSS. High internet usage (Z=2.19) and high socializing time (Z=2.53) both have weak positive correlations with PSS, suggesting these activities might contribute marginally to higher stress in this population.

**Evidence for a PSS score in the Bottom 50% (lower or average perceived stress):**
Conversely, a substantial array of psychological and behavioral factors suggests lower perceived stress. The participant's notably high self-esteem (Z=0.96), high happiness (Z=1.64), and low trait anxiety (Z=-0.33) are all strongly associated with lower PSS (negative correlations for self-esteem and happiness, and a positive correlation for STAI means *lower* anxiety equates to *lower* PSS). High trust (Z=1.79) also generally indicates greater well-being. Furthermore, the participant demonstrates an exceptionally regular and structured circadian rhythm, as evidenced by high Interdaily Stability (Z=1.16), low Intradaily Variability (Z=-1.94), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=1.23). These metrics generally correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting that a highly organized physiological routine may act as a protective factor. Engagement in exercise with others (Z=1.23) also contributes to a lower PSS. The high amount of time dedicated to a sedentary hobby (Z=3.19), despite its weak correlation, is associated with marginally *lower* PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits clear physiological signs of arousal (elevated RHR and Mesor) and self-reported sleep disturbance, these are counterbalanced by a robust psychological profile characterized by high self-esteem, happiness, low trait anxiety, and strong social engagement. The highly regular and stable circadian rhythm, along with consistent objective sleep duration, suggests a structured lifestyle that could mitigate the subjective perception of stress, despite the physiological burden. The strength and number of these protective psychological and behavioral factors, coupled with their moderate negative correlations with PSS, likely outweigh the impact of the elevated physiological arousal and mild depressive symptoms on *perceived* stress. Therefore, it is probable that the participant's strong internal resources and highly structured external life patterns buffer against high levels of perceived stress.

92515,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile generally indicates a favorable state of well-being, suggesting a tendency towards lower perceived stress. Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) are below the population average, with Z-scores of -0.97 and -0.52 respectively, classifying the participant as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious."" Both of these measures correlate positively with perceived stress, indicating that lower scores are associated with reduced stress levels. Furthermore, the participant exhibits higher self-esteem (Z-score: 0.4) and significantly higher reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64) compared to their peers. Both self-esteem and happiness correlate negatively with perceived stress, reinforcing the indication of lower stress. Health satisfaction, however, is below average (Z-score: -0.78) and correlates negatively with perceived stress, suggesting this aspect could contribute to a slight elevation in stress. Trust in others is higher than average (Z-score: 0.83) and shows a weak negative correlation with perceived stress. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with a 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters.

Analysis of sleep patterns reveals a significant area of concern that is strongly associated with elevated perceived stress. The participant's median sleep duration is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is markedly below the population average, reflected by a substantial Z-score of -1.58. This notably short sleep duration has a negative correlation with perceived stress, implying that less sleep is associated with higher stress. Furthermore, the variability in sleep start times is higher than average (Z-score: 0.59), and this metric positively correlates with perceived stress, indicating that less consistent sleep schedules are linked to greater stress. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6 classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" their Z-score of -0.33 suggests that this level of disturbance is not exceptionally high compared to the study population. Despite this, the objective wearable data on sleep duration and regularity present a strong pattern of chronic sleep deprivation and inconsistency, which are significant contributors to perceived stress.

Physiological data, particularly those related to circadian rhythms and heart rate, generally indicate a regulated and stable physiological profile. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (56.0 bpm, Z-score: -0.26), which positively correlates with perceived stress, thus suggesting a marginally lower stress level. Circadian rhythm metrics such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score: 0.09) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score: -0.11) are close to the population mean. Importantly, the Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: 0.73) is higher than average, indicating a strong and regular 24-hour heart rate rhythm. This metric correlates negatively with perceived stress, suggesting better physiological regulation is associated with lower stress. The heart rate amplitude is slightly lower than average (Z-score: -0.36), also correlating negatively with perceived stress. While hourly heart rate deviations show periods of notably elevated activity during the early afternoon (e.g., 12-1 pm Z-score: 1.46, 1-2 pm Z-score: 0.92, 2-3 pm Z-score: 1.19), these specific peaks generally correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting they may represent periods of focused activity rather than stress-induced arousal. The pattern of heart rate deviations through the day is consistent with typical physiological arousal and rest cycles, with no clear indication of chronic hyperarousal relative to the population that would suggest higher stress.

Lifestyle and recreational habits present a mixed picture, with several factors aligning with lower perceived stress. The participant engages in exercise with others and sports more frequently than the average student (Z-scores: 0.53 and 0.91 respectively), both of which correlate negatively with perceived stress. They also report less engagement in sedentary hobbies and video games, which also correlate negatively with PSS. Reading frequency is slightly higher than average (Z-score: 0.32) and correlates negatively with PSS. Conversely, the participant consumes wine or liquor more frequently than average (Z-score: 0.94), which has a weak positive correlation with perceived stress. Usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs is ""not at all,"" which correlates positively with perceived stress, suggesting lower PSS. Time spent watching TV/videos/movies is higher than average (Z-score: 0.64) and correlates weakly positively with perceived stress. Overall, the participant's engagement in physical activities and certain recreational habits tends to be associated with lower perceived stress, while higher alcohol consumption might mildly contribute to it.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators suggestive of lower or average perceived stress. Psychologically, they report notably lower levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.97) and anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.52), both of which typically correlate positively with perceived stress, thus indicating a lower stress burden. High self-esteem (Z-score: 0.4) and significantly elevated happiness (Z-score: 1.64) are also observed, both correlating negatively with perceived stress. Academically, consistent 4.0 GPAs demonstrate high functional capacity. Behaviorally, the participant engages in exercise and sports more frequently than peers (Z-scores: 0.53 and 0.91), and these activities correlate negatively with perceived stress. Furthermore, a strong 24-hour autocorrelation in heart rate (Z-score: 0.73) and average interdaily stability, with correlations suggesting lower stress, point to robust physiological regulation.

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%):**
Conversely, a critical area pointing to elevated perceived stress lies in the participant's sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is significantly short at 5 hours 55 minutes, corresponding to a Z-score of -1.58. This substantial deviation below the population average is strongly negatively correlated with the PSS score, indicating that shorter sleep duration is associated with markedly higher perceived stress. Compounding this, the participant exhibits higher than average variability in sleep start times (Z-score: 0.59), a factor that positively correlates with perceived stress, further suggesting a contribution to elevated stress levels. Additionally, self-reported health satisfaction is below average (Z-score: -0.78), and this negatively correlates with PSS, implying that lower health satisfaction is linked to higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant presents a resilient psychological profile, marked by lower depression and anxiety symptoms, higher self-esteem and happiness, and strong academic performance, the objective sleep data reveals a substantial and pervasive physiological stressor. The severely short and irregular sleep, as evidenced by the notably low median sleep duration (Z-score -1.58) and high sleep start time variability (Z-score 0.59), are metrics that are strongly correlated with elevated perceived stress. Given the profound impact that chronic sleep deprivation and dysregulation have on an individual's stress response and overall well-being, these objective findings are likely to exert a dominant influence on the participant's perceived stress levels, potentially overriding the positive self-reported psychological states. The discrepancy between self-reported psychological traits and objective behavioral and physiological indicators suggests that while the participant may perceive themselves as managing stress well or experiencing lower trait anxiety, the underlying physiological burden of chronic sleep issues is likely contributing to a higher overall experience of perceived stress. Therefore, despite many positive indicators, the significant and highly correlated sleep deficits lead to the conclusion that the participant's perceived stress level is likely in the upper half of the distribution.

49790,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a favorable psychological profile across several self-report measures. Depressive symptoms, as assessed by the CES-D, are very low (score 3.0, Z-score -1.07), classifying the individual as ""Not depressed."" Similarly, trait anxiety (STAI score 27.0, Z-score -1.41) is considerably below the population mean, indicating a ""not anxious"" disposition. High self-esteem (score 46.0, Z-score 1.1) and high satisfaction with physical health (score 5.89, Z-score 1.22) further contribute to this positive self-perception. Additionally, the participant reports higher-than-average trust in others (score 4.0, Z-score 1.47). While self-reported happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) is slightly below the population mean, it does not strongly counter the overall pattern of robust psychological well-being. These indicators generally suggest resilience and lower psychological distress.

Despite several positive psychological indicators, the participant’s sleep profile suggests significant disruption. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) classifies sleep as ""Disturbed,"" aligning with clinical thresholds for sleep disturbance, even though the Z-score for this individual is near the population average. This disturbance appears to be primarily driven by highly inconsistent sleep timing: the standard deviation of sleep start time is markedly elevated (169 minutes, Z-score 1.89), indicating substantial day-to-day variability. While median sleep duration is above average at 8 hours 4 minutes (Z-score 1.1), and sleep duration variability is only slightly above average, the pronounced irregularity in when sleep begins points to a lack of a stable sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) is also noted.

Physiological data reveal a pattern of elevated baseline cardiovascular activity and disrupted circadian regularity. The participant's resting heart rate (75.7 bpm, Z-score 2.09) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 88.8 bpm, Z-score 2.03) are both significantly higher than the study population average, suggesting a state of elevated physiological arousal. Concurrently, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm exhibits lower interdaily stability (value 0.25, Z-score -1.32) and very low autocorrelation at 24 hours (value 0.14, Z-score -1.54), collectively indicating a highly irregular and less predictable daily physiological pattern. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also below average (value 7.79, Z-score -0.97), suggesting a blunted range between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 6:15 PM, and aggregated hourly heart rate data show pronounced deviations above the Mesor extending into late evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, 9-10 PM, 11-12 AM), which, when combined with the elevated Mesor, signify sustained periods of higher heart rate activity.

The participant maintains strong academic performance, with consistently high GPAs. Body Mass Index (24.56) is within a healthy range. Lifestyle behaviors indicate moderate engagement in physical activity, exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, corresponding to slightly above-average Z-scores for these activities, though participation in organized sports is low. Alcohol consumption of wine or liquor is moderately elevated at 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.94), while beer and drug usage are low. Recreational habits show a notable pattern of lower engagement in several common leisure activities: internet usage (Z-score -1.16), listening to music (Z-score -0.72), socializing (Z-score -0.62), reading (Z-score -0.67), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.36) are all below average. Conversely, time spent watching TV/videos/movies is above average (Z-score 0.64). This pattern suggests a selective engagement in passive recreation and potentially reduced engagement in more active or social forms of leisure compared to peers.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**
The self-report survey data provide compelling evidence for a PSS score in the bottom half of the distribution. The participant reports significantly lower-than-average levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score -1.07), which positively correlates with PSS (0.28), indicating lower scores are associated with lower perceived stress. Similarly, trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.41) is considerably below the population mean and also positively correlated with PSS (0.32), further suggesting lower perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1), high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22), and high trust (Z-score 1.47), all of which are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15, -0.08, and -0.04 respectively), implying their higher values contribute to lower perceived stress. Consistently strong academic performance (high GPAs) also suggests effective coping in a primary domain of student life.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**
Conversely, several physiological and sleep metrics suggest a potential for elevated perceived stress, indicating a PSS score in the top half of the distribution. The most prominent indicators are the significantly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 2.09) and Mesor (Z-score 2.03), both positively correlated with PSS (0.14 and 0.06 respectively), reflecting a state of chronic physiological arousal. The self-reported sleep quality is classified as ""Disturbed"" by the PSQI (score 7.0), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is very high (Z-score 1.89), which is positively correlated with PSS (0.17), indicating significant sleep schedule irregularity that is associated with higher perceived stress. Elevated wine or liquor consumption (Z-score 0.94) is also noted, though its correlation with PSS is weak (0.03). The participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythm shows notable irregularity with low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.32) and very low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.54), though these metrics show weak negative correlations with PSS (-0.12 and -0.17 respectively), which is a counter-intuitive finding if irregularity is assumed to increase perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When evaluating the participant's overall perceived stress, a tension exists between their strong self-reported psychological well-being and objective physiological and sleep disruptions. The participant's self-perception, as indicated by very low scores on scales for depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) and high scores for self-esteem and health satisfaction, strongly suggests a low level of *perceived* stress. These psychological traits are directly related to an individual's subjective experience of stress. While physiological markers show an elevated resting heart rate and a disrupted circadian rhythm, and sleep is classified as disturbed due to irregularity, the individual's subjective experience, as measured by the core psychological well-being scales, appears to buffer against perceiving these physiological and behavioral challenges as highly stressful. The correlations of CES-D and STAI with PSS are stronger than those for the physiological measures. Therefore, despite physiological arousal and sleep schedule inconsistencies, the robust self-reported psychological resilience points towards a lower overall perceived stress level compared to the study population.

78657,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a nuanced psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by generally average self-reported psychological well-being markers, yet significant indicators of sleep disturbance, disrupted circadian rhythmicity, and pronounced physiological arousal patterns. Self-report measures for depressive symptoms (CESD score 12.0, Z-score -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI score 38.0, Z-score -0.33) fall within the non-clinical and average ranges for the study population. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11), and trust in others is notably high (Z-score 0.83). However, self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), and a particularly salient finding is the significantly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.53), suggesting an underlying concern in this domain despite an average Body Mass Index.

A key area of concern emerges from the participant's sleep patterns. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, with a Z-score of 0.13, indicates self-reported disturbed sleep quality, even if not extremely high within the student population. Objective Fitbit data further elaborates on this, revealing a below-average median sleep duration of 6 hours 30 minutes (Z-score -0.85). More critically, the participant displays a highly irregular sleep schedule, with a very late median sleep start time of 03:38:30 and a significantly high standard deviation for sleep start times (Z-score 0.88), indicative of substantial day-to-day variability in bedtime. This objective evidence of sleep fragmentation and irregularity strongly corroborates the self-reported sleep disturbance.

Physiological data derived from heart rate metrics further underscore these patterns of dysregulation. The participant's circadian rhythm, as measured by heart rate, shows below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82) and elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.88), pointing to less regular and more fragmented daily physiological patterns. The 24-hour heart rate rhythm is also weaker than average (Z-score -0.61). While the mean heart rate (Mesor, Z-score -0.7) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) are below average, suggesting good baseline cardiovascular fitness, the *timing* of physiological arousal is significantly altered. Aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate sustained physiological activation extending late into the evening, peaking prominently around 7-8 PM (Z-score 1.53), consistent with a late acrophase (6:50 PM). This elevated heart rate then persists into the early morning hours (12-2 AM, Z-scores up to 1.58), suggesting difficulty in achieving a quiescent state necessary for restorative sleep and aligning with the observed late and variable sleep onset.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a high level of physical activity, reporting exercising alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 1.23) three times a week or more, suggesting an active lifestyle. Recreational habits include substantial engagement with video games (Z-score 1.71) and listening to music (Z-score 1.6), and moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for beer, wine, or liquor). These lifestyle choices, particularly screen-based activities like video gaming late into the evening, could potentially contribute to the observed delayed and prolonged physiological arousal patterns, further exacerbating sleep difficulties.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

Multiple lines of evidence suggest the participant's perceived stress level is likely in the top 50% of the study population. A primary indicator is the significantly low self-reported health satisfaction (Z-score -1.53), which demonstrates a negative correlation (-0.08) with PSS, meaning lower health satisfaction is associated with higher perceived stress. Furthermore, objective sleep metrics consistently point to significant sleep disturbance: the median sleep duration is below average (Z-score -0.85), and critically, the variability in sleep start times is notably high (Z-score 0.88). The latter metric carries a positive correlation (0.18) with PSS, indicating that greater irregularity in sleep timing is associated with higher perceived stress. The participant's self-reported PSQI score of 7.0 also classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep.""

Physiological data further supports this assessment. The heart rate-derived circadian rhythms show below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82) and elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.88), both of which are correlated with PSS in expected directions (negative for stability, positive for variability). The pattern of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals prolonged physiological arousal, with significantly elevated heart rates extending late into the evening (peaking at 7-8 PM with a Z-score of 1.53) and persisting into the early morning (1-2 AM with a Z-score of 1.58). This sustained arousal suggests difficulty in achieving a relaxed state, a common manifestation of elevated stress. Additionally, the participant's slightly below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) correlates negatively with PSS (-0.19), indirectly supporting a higher stress level.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

Conversely, some self-reported psychological measures are within or slightly below average for the study population, which might suggest a lower or average perceived stress level. The participant reports average levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.14) and slightly below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33), with these scores having relatively low positive correlations with PSS. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11), which generally correlates negatively with PSS (-0.15). The participant also demonstrates good baseline cardiovascular health with a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) and Mesor (Z-score -0.7). High levels of physical activity (exercising alone Z-score 1.07, exercising with others Z-score 1.23) are also noted, which can be a protective factor against stress, although their direct correlation with PSS in this dataset is negligible.

**Holistic Analysis:**

While the participant's self-reported depression and anxiety scores are within average limits, the holistic analysis strongly points towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The significant objective evidence of disturbed and highly irregular sleep patterns, coupled with a disrupted physiological circadian rhythm (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, weak 24-hour autocorrelation), presents a coherent picture of chronic physiological dysregulation. The persistent, delayed, and prolonged physiological arousal observed in the hourly heart rate data further reinforces this. These physiological and behavioral disruptions are consistently associated with higher perceived stress, as indicated by the correlations provided. The participant's notably low health satisfaction also serves as a strong subjective indicator of elevated stress. Despite maintaining high levels of physical activity and having average self-reported psychological trait scores, the pervasive and objectively measurable disturbances in sleep and physiological regulation, alongside the subjective concern for health, collectively outweigh the evidence suggesting lower stress.

Based on this comprehensive evaluation, the participant's PSS score is most likely in the top 50% of the study population.

48154,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile with notably low self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Their CESD score of 3.0 (Z-score = -1.07) classifies them as 'Not depressed', and their STAI score of 30.0 (Z-score = -1.12) indicates they are 'not anxious', both falling significantly below the population average. These indicators are positively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that lower symptoms in these areas align with lower PSS. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (Score = 50.0, Z-score = 1.66) and high current happiness (Score = 5.0, Z-score = 1.64), both of which are substantially above the population mean and negatively correlated with perceived stress. Satisfaction with physical health is also above average (Score = 4.89, Z-score = 0.47). Academic performance, as reflected by consistent GPAs above 3.47, suggests strong academic functioning. Collectively, these self-reported measures paint a picture of high psychological well-being and positive self-perception, generally indicative of lower perceived stress.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports 'Good Sleep' with a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score = -0.8), placing their subjective sleep quality well above the population average, albeit at the threshold often used for clinical significance for absolute scores. Objective wearable data further supports a healthy sleep profile, with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score = 1.08), indicating substantially longer sleep than the average participant. Sleep duration variability is low (Standard Deviation = 64 minutes, Z-score = -0.85), suggesting consistent sleep duration across nights. Similarly, the variability in sleep start times is slightly below average (Standard Deviation = 72 minutes, Z-score = -0.24), although their median sleep start time is 01:03:00, which is relatively late. The participant also reports taking no naps on average (Z-score = -0.86). Overall, both subjective and objective data indicate consistent and sufficient sleep, which is generally associated with lower perceived stress, with consistent sleep duration variability showing a positive correlation with PSS.

The participant engages in regular physical activity, exercising alone 'Three times a week or more' (Z-score = 1.07) and participating in sports '1-2 times a week' (Z-score = 0.91), both activities being more frequent than the population average. Conversely, exercising with others is less frequent ('Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score = -0.88). In terms of substance use, the participant reports above-average frequency for wine or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.94) and recreational drug use ('Less than 1-2 times a month', Z-score = 1.61), although non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreation habits include 2-3 hours of internet usage (Z-score = 0.85) and 1-2 hours of socializing with friends (Z-score = 0.16), both near or above population averages. They do not report engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies, which are below average. The overall pattern suggests an active lifestyle with some above-average recreational substance use, but also significant engagement in physical exercise and social interaction.

Analysis of heart rate derived circadian rhythms reveals a Resting Heart Rate of 56.0 bpm, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.26), generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The participant's Mesor (mean heart rate) is 68.26 bpm (Z-score = -0.78), also below average. However, some aspects of circadian rhythm regularity present a contrasting pattern. The Interdaily Stability (Value = 0.26, Z-score = -1.23) is significantly below the population average, suggesting less day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns, which is negatively correlated with PSS, implying lower stability is associated with higher perceived stress. Similarly, the Amplitude (Value = 8.57, Z-score = -0.71) is also below average, indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates, which is also negatively correlated with PSS. Intradaily Variability (Value = 0.56, Z-score = 0.1) is near the population average. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 5:29 PM. These physiological markers suggest a potentially less robust or regular physiological rhythm compared to the population, which may reflect physiological responses to demands, even if not directly perceived as stress.

The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rate significantly dropping during typical sleep hours and rising during waking hours. The lowest deviations occur in the early morning, with a trough around 6-7 AM (-16.52 bpm below mesor), consistent with deep sleep. Heart rate gradually increases throughout the morning, showing a noticeable rise around 9-10 AM (+3.04 bpm) and peaking in the late afternoon and early evening. The highest deviations are observed between 5-6 PM (+18.24 bpm above mesor, Z-score = 1.13) and 6-7 PM (+15.42 bpm, Z-score = 0.51), followed by a gradual decline into the night. This pattern, marked by a pronounced afternoon/evening peak in activity, aligns with the acrophase and indicates a normal physiological response to daily activity and demands, relative to the participant's lower resting heart rate and mesor. The magnitude of the evening peak (Z-score 1.13) indicates this participant shows a more pronounced heart rate elevation during this period compared to the average.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile)**:
A substantial body of evidence supports the conclusion that the participant likely experiences low or average perceived stress, placing them in the bottom half of the study population distribution. Self-report measures are overwhelmingly positive: depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.12) are significantly below average, indicating excellent psychological health in these domains. Self-esteem (Z-score 1.66) and reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) are remarkably high. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) is good, and objective wearable data confirms ample sleep duration (Z-score 1.08) with low variability in duration (Z-score -0.85) and start times (Z-score -0.24), indicating consistent and restorative sleep. The participant maintains above-average levels of physical exercise. Importantly, the correlations provided consistently link these positive indicators to lower PSS scores: lower CESD and STAI scores, higher self-esteem and happiness, and lower sleep duration variability all correlate with lower perceived stress. Physiologically, a slightly below-average resting heart rate also aligns with lower physiological stress.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile)**:
Countervailing evidence suggesting higher perceived stress is less pronounced but warrants consideration. Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate lower Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.23) and lower Amplitude (Z-score -0.71) compared to the study population. Lower interdaily stability implies less regularity in the participant's daily heart rate patterns, while lower amplitude suggests a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates. Both of these metrics are negatively correlated with PSS (Interdaily Stability: -0.12, Amplitude: -0.17), meaning that lower values are associated with higher perceived stress. While these physiological patterns might suggest a less robust or less adaptable autonomic nervous system response, potentially indicative of underlying stress or a predisposition to it, their implication for *perceived* stress is indirect when compared to the direct self-report measures. Additionally, the participant reports above-average usage of wine/liquor and recreational drugs, though their correlations with PSS are very weak and thus provide minimal support for elevated PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**:
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the extensive and robust evidence from self-reported psychological measures strongly indicates a profile consistent with low perceived stress. The participant's very low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, good self-reported and objectively measured sleep, and active lifestyle are powerful indicators of overall well-being. While the wearable circadian rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability and amplitude) present a physiological pattern that *can* be associated with higher stress, this physiological signal is largely contradicted by the participant's subjective experience. Given that the Perceived Stress Scale directly measures subjective perceptions of stress, the strong self-report data provides the most direct and compelling evidence. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, particularly the direct psychological assessments, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

21793,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, coupled with elevated trait anxiety and declining academic performance, which collectively point towards a state of chronic physiological and psychological dysregulation.

Psychologically, the participant reports above-average trait anxiety (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score 0.17), indicating a disposition towards experiencing anxiety, a factor positively correlated with perceived stress. While symptoms of depression (CESD score of 15.0, Z-score 0.18) are within the average range, self-reported happiness (Current: 3.0, Z-score -0.53) is notably below the population mean, which negatively correlates with perceived stress. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17). Academically, a significant decline in GPA from prior semesters (from approximately 3.0 to 2.17 in Fall 2016) suggests potential challenges or increased academic burden during the study period. Despite these psychological indicators, the participant reports slightly above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.3).

The most striking patterns emerge from the sleep and circadian rhythm data. The participant experiences clinically significant sleep disturbance, as indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This is further corroborated by wearable data, which reveals a median sleep duration of only 6 hours and 9 minutes (Z-score -1.29), substantially shorter than the population average. Sleep onset is remarkably late, with a median start time of 03:36:45, and both sleep duration (standard deviation of 116 minutes, Z-score 0.36) and especially sleep start times (standard deviation of 130 minutes, Z-score 1.04) are highly variable. The high frequency of napping (mean daily naps: 0.33, Z-score 3.05) suggests a compensatory mechanism for insufficient nighttime sleep. These profound irregularities in sleep duration and timing, along with disturbed sleep quality, are critical indicators of behavioral and physiological strain.

Further evidence of physiological dysregulation is observed in the circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data. The participant exhibits extremely low interdaily stability (Value 0.17, Z-score -1.98) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Value 0.15, Z-score -1.45), signifying a highly irregular and poorly structured daily activity-rest pattern. Concurrently, intradaily variability (Value 0.68, Z-score 0.95) is elevated, suggesting greater fragmentation or rapid shifts in physiological arousal within a single day. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 6:32 PM, which, when combined with a lower mesor (Z-score -1.13) and amplitude (Z-score -1.38), points to a blunted and phase-delayed physiological rhythm. Importantly, analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals significantly elevated heart rates during the early morning hours, particularly between 1-3 AM (Z-scores up to 2.07), a period when heart rate should typically be at its lowest point. This pattern indicates physiological arousal during expected deep sleep, potentially reflecting sleep onset difficulties or fragmented sleep.

Regarding daily behaviors, the participant's substance usage is moderate to low, with beer and wine/liquor consumption around 1-2 times a month and no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are moderate, primarily exercising alone (1-2 times a week). Recreational activities are characterized by extensive listening to music (3-4 hours daily, Z-score 1.6) and a notable absence of reading, which is below average (Z-score -0.67) and negatively correlated with PSS. Other screen-based activities like watching TV/videos are above average (Z-score 0.64). This pattern suggests a preference for more passive forms of recreation, which may not effectively mitigate the physiological and psychological stressors identified.

In summary, the participant’s profile is marked by pervasive sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, characterized by late, short, and highly variable sleep, along with early morning physiological arousal. These objective and subjective sleep issues are compounded by an underlying predisposition to anxiety and observed declines in academic performance, creating a strong indication of a system under considerable stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is substantial and pervasive across multiple domains. Psychologically, the participant reports above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17), which directly correlates with higher perceived stress (r=0.31). This is further supported by below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), which is negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.19), suggesting lower well-being associated with higher stress. The concerning trend of declining academic performance, with a significant drop in GPA, is a common indicator of heightened stress among students.

The most compelling evidence for elevated stress comes from the profound disturbances in sleep and circadian rhythms. The participant's PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) clearly indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, a well-established consequence and contributor to stress. Objective wearable data reinforces this, showing critically short median sleep duration (6 hours 9 minutes, Z-score -1.29) and extremely late, highly variable sleep start times (median 03:36:45, Z-score for standard deviation 1.04). Both increased variability in sleep duration (r=0.14) and sleep start time (r=0.16) are positively correlated with PSS, meaning greater irregularity is associated with higher stress. The exceptionally high frequency of napping (Z-score 3.05) further suggests an attempt to compensate for inadequate nocturnal sleep, indicative of a body under strain.

Physiologically, the heart rate data reveals significant circadian dysregulation. Interdaily stability (Z-score -1.98) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.45) are remarkably low, reflecting highly irregular daily routines, both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (r=-0.11 and r=-0.16, respectively, meaning lower regularity is linked to higher stress). Conversely, intradaily variability is elevated (Z-score 0.95), indicating fragmented physiological patterns within the day, and positively correlated with PSS (r=0.16). Crucially, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows distinct positive deviations from the mesor during early morning hours (e.g., 2-3 AM, Z-score 2.07), implying physiological arousal at times typically associated with deepest sleep. This pattern of physiological dysregulation, particularly during sleep, is a strong biomarker of chronic stress.

Evidence for a low or median PSS score is notably sparse and generally less impactful. While the participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.47), which can be a sign of cardiovascular fitness, this single factor is heavily outweighed by the pervasive and severe sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. Self-esteem (Z-score -0.17) is slightly below average, but its negative correlation with PSS (r=-0.15) actually suggests it contributes to higher perceived stress. Health satisfaction (Z-score 0.3) is average, and substance use/exercise patterns are generally moderate, not providing strong counter-evidence for high stress.

Considering the cumulative weight of evidence, particularly the pronounced and interconnected issues in sleep quality, circadian regularity, physiological arousal during rest, elevated trait anxiety, and declining academic performance, the participant's overall profile strongly indicates a state of elevated perceived stress. These multifaceted stressors, many with explicit correlations to PSS, make it highly probable that the participant’s PSS score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a notable profile of psychological distress, sleep disturbance, and specific behavioral patterns that collectively point towards elevated perceived stress. Self-report measures indicate significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score Z=1.11, classified as ""Depressed"") and higher trait anxiety (STAI score Z=0.76, classified as ""anxious""). These are further compounded by significantly lower self-esteem (Z=-1.29) and profoundly reduced self-reported happiness (Z=-1.61), alongside moderately low satisfaction with physical health (Z=-0.95). These psychological indicators are all correlated in directions consistent with higher perceived stress.

Sleep patterns are a particularly salient feature of this participant's profile. Subjectively, the participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance (PSQI score Z=1.52, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""). Objectively, wearable data corroborates this, showing a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 1 minute (Z=-1.45) and an exceptionally late median sleep start time of 03:56:30. Furthermore, aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals prolonged physiological arousal extending into the late night and early morning hours; specifically, the mean heart rate deviates significantly above the mesor between 9 PM and 2 AM, with the 1-2 AM period showing a very high Z-score of 1.67. This late-night heart rate elevation suggests difficulty in achieving a quiescent physiological state necessary for sleep onset and restorative rest, aligning with the reported poor subjective sleep quality and objective short sleep duration.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates very low engagement in physical exercise, reporting ""Not at all"" for both exercising alone (Z=-1.93) and with others (Z=-1.58). Recreational habits are characterized by above-average engagement in passive activities such as listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z=2.06) and watching TV/videos (1-2 hours, Z=1.28), as well as significant time spent socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z=1.74). The absence of substance use indicates that these are not used as coping mechanisms. This pattern suggests a preference for less physically demanding leisure activities, which, when combined with the low exercise levels, may contribute to overall physiological and psychological well-being challenges.

Physiologically, while the overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z=0.3) and resting heart rate (Z=0.34) are within average bounds, the circadian amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is moderately lower (Z=-0.63). This attenuated amplitude indicates a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rate values, which can be indicative of a less robust physiological response system. Although interdaily stability (Z=0.58) suggests some regularity in daily heart rate patterns, this is overshadowed by the persistent late-night physiological arousal and reduced amplitude, suggesting a compromised circadian function particularly concerning nighttime recovery.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

A holistic analysis of the available data strongly suggests that the participant's perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution (top 50%).

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**
*   **Pronounced Psychological Distress:** The participant exhibits significantly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z=1.11, positive correlation with PSS: 0.29) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.76, positive correlation with PSS: 0.32). Critically, both self-esteem (Z=-1.29) and self-reported happiness (Z=-1.61) are remarkably low, and their negative correlations with PSS (-0.16 and -0.20 respectively) mean lower values are associated with higher perceived stress.
*   **Severe Sleep Disturbance:** Subjective sleep quality is clinically disturbed (PSQI Z=1.52). Objectively, sleep duration is significantly short (6 hours 1 minute, Z=-1.45), and the median sleep start time is exceptionally late (03:56:30). These are well-established indicators of heightened stress.
*   **Late-Night Physiological Arousal:** The most compelling physiological indicator is the aggregate heart rate data, showing sustained elevation above the mesor late into the night (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z=1.67). This pattern of physiological arousal during typical resting hours is a strong marker of chronic stress and difficulty with recovery.
*   **Reduced Circadian Amplitude:** A moderately lower circadian amplitude (Z=-0.63, negative correlation with PSS: -0.17) indicates a less robust daily physiological rhythm, which can be a sign of increased physiological load or diminished adaptive capacity in the face of stress.
*   **Low Exercise Engagement:** The very low levels of self-reported exercise (e.g., exercising alone Z=-1.93) suggest a lack of a common stress-reducing coping mechanism.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**
*   **Average Circadian Rhythms (Some Aspects):** The Mesor (mean heart rate), Intradaily Variability, and Autocorrelation at 24 hours are generally within the average range. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z=0.58), suggesting some consistency in the overall heart rate rhythm across days. However, these are weak indicators against the strong evidence of distress.
*   **Average Resting Heart Rate:** The participant's resting heart rate (Z=0.34) is average. While a high RHR is a stress indicator, an average RHR does not negate other strong stress indicators.
*   **Absence of Substance Use:** The participant reports no substance use, which, while generally positive for health, does not directly counteract the psychological and physiological markers of stress observed.

**Conclusion:**
The convergence of multiple strong indicators—including elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, critically low self-esteem and happiness, clinically significant sleep disturbance, objectively short and late sleep, and sustained physiological arousal into the early morning hours—overwhelmingly points to a participant experiencing high levels of perceived stress. The limited evidence for lower stress (e.g., average RHR, some average circadian metrics) is overshadowed by the depth and breadth of the distress observed across self-report and wearable data. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents with a generally resilient psychological profile. Self-report measures indicate low levels of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 12.0 (Z-score -0.14), and low trait anxiety, reflected by a STAI score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.62), both falling below the population means. Self-esteem is notably high (RSES score 44.0, Z-score 0.82), suggesting a robust sense of self-worth. Academic performance is consistently strong, with a GPA around 3.8 across multiple semesters, indicating effective functioning in an academic environment. These factors collectively suggest a capacity for psychological well-being, which would typically be associated with lower levels of perceived stress. However, self-reported happiness is slightly below the population average (Current score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), providing a minor counterpoint to the otherwise positive psychological landscape.

Behavioral patterns reveal an active and engaged individual. The participant reports engaging in solitary exercise three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07) and participating in sports and group exercise 1-2 times a week (Z-scores 0.91 and 0.53, respectively), indicating a consistent commitment to physical activity. Recreational habits show above-average engagement in reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score 1.3), which has a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress. There is also a significantly high engagement in video games (1-2 hours, Z-score 2.47), which, while potentially a leisure pursuit, could also serve as a substantial coping mechanism. Alcohol consumption is reported as 1-2 times a week for both beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), placing the participant above the population mean for these substances, though recreational drug use is absent. Overall, the active lifestyle, particularly consistent exercise, typically functions as a buffer against stress.

Sleep data presents a significant divergence between objective and subjective measures. Objectively, Fitbit data indicates a remarkably long median sleep duration of 8 hours 35 minutes (Z-score 1.74), placing the participant well above average for sleep quantity. Furthermore, sleep start times exhibit high regularity (standard deviation of 53 minutes, Z-score -0.66), suggesting consistent sleep scheduling. These objective metrics indicate ample and consistent sleep. In stark contrast, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score is 13.0, with an exceptionally high Z-score of 2.9, resulting in a classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" This substantial discrepancy highlights a profound subjective experience of poor sleep quality and related difficulties, despite objective indicators of sufficient and regular sleep. This internal inconsistency between objective sleep health and subjective perception may significantly contribute to perceived stress.

Physiological data derived from the wearable device points to robust and well-regulated cardiovascular and circadian systems. The participant exhibits an excellent resting heart rate (48.65 bpm, Z-score -1.13) and a below-average mesor (mean heart rate of 66.57 bpm, Z-score -1.01), both indicative of strong cardiovascular fitness and low basal physiological arousal. Circadian rhythm metrics are highly favorable: Interdaily Stability is above average (0.54, Z-score 1.08), Intradaily Variability is below average (0.37, Z-score -1.24), and Autocorrelation at 24 hours is significantly high (0.52, Z-score 1.65). These, along with an above-average amplitude (12.61, Z-score 0.59), collectively demonstrate a highly stable, regular, and robust heart rate-based circadian rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart rate data further supports this, showing typical and well-defined diurnal fluctuations with significant quiescence during sleep periods (e.g., -25.81 deviation at 7-8 AM) and appropriate increases during active hours (e.g., 18.63 deviation at 11 AM - 12 PM). These physiological patterns are generally associated with a healthy stress response and overall well-being.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

### Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)
Numerous indicators suggest the participant possesses characteristics typically associated with lower or average levels of perceived stress. Psychologically, the participant demonstrates below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62), both of which correlate positively with PSS, meaning lower scores on these measures suggest lower PSS. Additionally, above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.82) and consistent high academic performance (GPA > 3.8) contribute to a resilient psychological profile. Physiologically, the participant exhibits excellent cardiovascular health, as evidenced by a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.13) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.01), both suggesting low physiological stress. Furthermore, wearable data highlights remarkably stable and robust circadian rhythms across multiple metrics, including high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.08), low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.24), and high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.65), which are typically associated with better physiological well-being and stress regulation. Objective sleep measures also show long sleep duration (Z-score 1.74) and high regularity in sleep timing (Z-score -0.66), indicating good objective sleep habits. Finally, an active lifestyle with high engagement in exercise and sports, along with above-average reading (Z-score 1.3, moderately negatively correlated with PSS), further contributes to a profile generally associated with lower stress levels.

### Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%)
Despite the strong profile of resilience and objective well-being, significant evidence suggests that the participant's *perceived* stress level may be elevated, placing them in the top half of the study population. The most prominent factor is the participant's self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). With a score of 13.0 and an exceptionally high Z-score of 2.9, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep."" This extreme subjective experience of poor sleep quality and related difficulties, despite objectively sufficient and regular sleep duration, points to a substantial perception of distress related to a fundamental aspect of well-being. Since the PSS directly measures perceived stress, such a profound subjective disturbance in sleep is a powerful indicator of elevated perceived stress. Additionally, the participant's self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score -0.53), and a negative correlation between happiness and PSS indicates that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. While highly engaged in video games (Z-score 2.47), this behavior, if used primarily as an escape, might indicate underlying stress, although its direct correlation with PSS is weakly negative.

### Holistic Analysis and Conclusion
A holistic analysis reveals a complex picture characterized by a strong physiological and psychological foundation for resilience, yet a critical area of pronounced subjective distress. While the participant benefits from excellent cardiovascular health, robust circadian rhythms, a highly active lifestyle, and low levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, the exceptional self-reported sleep disturbance (PSQI Z-score 2.9) stands out as a dominant factor in the experience of perceived stress. The PSS specifically assesses an individual's *perception* of stress. A severe perception of disturbed sleep, even in the presence of objective sleep quantity and regularity, is a potent contributor to overall feelings of being overwhelmed or unable to cope. Given the profound magnitude of the subjective sleep quality issue, which likely pervades daily functioning and well-being, this factor is weighted heavily. Therefore, despite many indicators that would otherwise suggest lower stress, the participant's perceived stress level is most likely elevated due to this significant internal incongruence and profound subjective distress, placing them in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

81420,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates notable elevations in both depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score of 25.0 corresponds to a Z-score of 1.22, classifying these symptoms as ""depressed"" relative to the study population, and exhibiting a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28). Similarly, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86) suggests elevated trait anxiety. These findings are further supported by a lower self-esteem score (Z-score -1.01) and significantly reduced satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.11), both of which are commonly associated with increased psychological distress. While the participant reports slightly above-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55), this subjective assessment stands in contrast to the more objective measures of psychological burden. Academically, a decline in GPA from 3.28 to 2.9 between Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 may represent an additional source of stress or an impact of the reported psychological states.

Sleep quality is indicated as disturbed by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59). Despite an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes, the participant's median sleep start time is notably late at 02:40:30, with some variability (standard deviation of 93 minutes, Z-score 0.22). This late and somewhat inconsistent sleep schedule likely contributes to the reported sleep disturbance. Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics further characterize this pattern: Interdaily Stability (IS) is below average (Z-score -0.99), suggesting less day-to-day regularity in heart rate rhythms, and the Amplitude is also lower than average (Z-score -0.74), indicating a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rate throughout the day. These findings collectively point to a less robust and regular physiological rhythm, which can be both a consequence and a contributor to stress. Intriguingly, Intradaily Variability (IV) is significantly below average (Z-score -1.66), implying less fluctuation in heart rate within a single day. While a very low IV can sometimes be associated with dampened physiological responsiveness, its weak positive correlation with PSS suggests it might be less predictive of high stress in this specific population context.

Physiological data reveals a heightened baseline of cardiovascular activity, with an elevated Mesor heart rate (78.34 bpm, Z-score 0.6) and a higher Resting Heart Rate (62.6 bpm, Z-score 0.53). These elevated baselines indicate a state of general physiological arousal. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor further supports this, showing that during typical resting hours (e.g., 2-7 AM), the participant's heart rate, while lower than their daily average, remains relatively higher than that of their peers (indicated by positive Z-scores in these intervals). This suggests a persistent sympathetic tone even during periods typically associated with rest. In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports being highly active, engaging in exercise alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and participating in sports (Z-score 0.91), along with significant time spent reading (Z-score 1.3). While these activities are often associated with stress reduction, their weak correlations with PSS suggest they may not fully mitigate the reported psychological and physiological stressors. Elevated beer consumption (Z-score 1.01) is also noted, which could potentially serve as a coping mechanism.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits multiple strong indicators suggestive of elevated perceived stress. Self-report measures reveal significant levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z-score 1.22) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.86), both of which show positive correlations with PSS scores. Furthermore, the participant reports lower self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) and significantly lower satisfaction with their health (Z-score -1.11), factors frequently associated with increased stress. Sleep quality is noted as disturbed by the PSQI (Z-score 0.59). Physiologically, there is consistent evidence of chronic arousal, including an elevated Mesor heart rate (Z-score 0.6) and a higher Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.53) compared to the population mean. Hourly heart rate data during typical resting periods also indicates heart rates that are relatively higher than those of peers during those times, further supporting a persistent state of elevated physiological activation. The decline in academic performance (GPA) may also reflect or contribute to academic stress.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Countervailing evidence for a lower PSS score is less prominent. The participant reports slightly above-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55), which could suggest moments of positive affect, though this contrasts with the overall pattern of distress. Sleep duration is within the average range (Z-score 0.02), suggesting quantity is not the primary issue, though quality is poor. The participant also engages in high levels of physical activity and reading, which are generally considered beneficial for stress management, but the accompanying correlations with PSS are weak or negligible, suggesting their mitigating effect may be limited in this context. The significantly low Intradaily Variability (IV) of heart rate (Z-score -1.66) has a weak positive correlation with PSS, which, if interpreted purely by correlation, might suggest lower stress. However, low IV can also indicate dampened physiological flexibility, which is not necessarily a positive health indicator, especially when viewed alongside other elevated arousal markers.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Weighing the evidence, the indicators for elevated perceived stress are considerably more numerous and impactful than those suggesting low or median stress. The combination of pronounced self-reported psychological distress (depressive symptoms, anxiety, low self-esteem, low health satisfaction), clinically disturbed sleep, and objective physiological markers of chronic arousal (elevated Mesor and resting heart rate, relatively higher resting heart rate compared to peers, and less robust circadian rhythmicity) strongly points towards a significant burden of perceived stress. Despite engagement in positive coping behaviors like exercise and reading, and an average sleep duration, these elements do not appear to fully counteract the pervasive psychological and physiological signs of stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

67709,26.0,0.927461139896373,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates notable areas of distress alongside some positive attributes. A score of 29.0 on the CES-D, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.63, classifies the participant as experiencing depressive symptoms, which is significantly above the population mean and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress (0.28). Similarly, the STAI-Trait score of 46.0 (Z-score 0.46) suggests an anxious disposition, also positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). These observations are further supported by a self-esteem score of 33.0 (Z-score -0.73), which is below the population average and negatively correlated with perceived stress, indicating that lower self-esteem is associated with higher perceived stress. Academically, the participant experienced a substantial decline in GPA from Fall 2015 to Fall 2016 (from 3.46/3.47 to 2.13), which represents a significant external stressor. Counterbalancing these findings, the participant reports higher-than-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22), though these are negatively correlated with perceived stress, suggesting that these positive aspects may not fully mitigate the overall psychological distress.

Analysis of sleep patterns reveals a complex profile. While the participant reports a clinically significant sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score 6.0), their Z-score of -0.33 indicates that this level of disturbance is actually slightly better than the average within the study population, which may generally experience poor sleep quality. Wearable data corroborates aspects of disturbed sleep timing and regularity: the participant records a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score 1.34), which is notably longer than the population average and negatively correlated with PSS. However, this seemingly adequate duration is accompanied by a highly variable sleep duration (standard deviation of 173 minutes, Z-score 1.65) and a very late median sleep start time of 03:45 AM, with moderate variability in start times (standard deviation of 98 minutes, Z-score 0.33). The participant also engages in more frequent napping than average (Z-score 0.82). The considerable variability in both sleep duration and start time, coupled with a late sleep onset, suggests a disrupted sleep schedule that is inconsistent despite yielding a long average sleep duration, aligning with the ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification from PSQI and potentially reflecting poor sleep hygiene or an irregular lifestyle.

Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate metrics point to a less stable and delayed circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.24) and significantly lower autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.12), indicating less regularity in their daily heart rate patterns. While intraday variability is lower (Z-score -0.60), which typically suggests less fragmentation, in conjunction with other rhythm metrics, it might imply a less dynamic rhythm rather than better organization. The mesor heart rate (Z-score -0.83) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) are both lower than the population average, generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.27), suggesting a more pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs late in the day at 6:15 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a very slow physiological awakening, with heart rate remaining significantly below the mesor in the morning hours (e.g., Z-score -1.94 at 9-10 AM). Conversely, there is a pronounced peak in heart rate deviation in the late afternoon/early evening (5-6 PM), reaching an exceptionally high value (29.45, Z-score 2.76), indicating a period of significant physiological arousal or intense activity. Elevated heart rates persist into the late evening (Z-score 1.09 at 10-11 PM), consistent with the delayed acrophase and late sleep onset, and suggesting sustained physiological activation later into the night.

Behavioral habits show the participant abstains entirely from substance use, with very low Z-scores across all categories (e.g., Beer usage Z-score -1.12, Wine or Liquor Z-score -1.30). The participant engages in regular social exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23), which is a positive coping mechanism, and also exercises alone 1-2 times a week. However, they do not participate in sports. Recreational habits include high internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.52) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), while they report not engaging in TV/videos/movies, video games, or reading. The participant also reports a significant amount of time dedicated to sedentary hobbies (31 minutes per hour, Z-score 0.82), indicating a largely digital and sedentary recreational lifestyle outside of social exercise. These activity patterns, particularly the high internet usage and sedentary habits, might contribute to or reflect aspects of the observed delayed and less stable circadian rhythm, or serve as coping mechanisms that do not fully alleviate underlying psychological distress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Several strong indicators suggest the participant likely experiences a higher level of perceived stress. The most prominent evidence comes from self-reported psychological measures: the CES-D score (29.0, Z-score 1.63) places the participant in the ""Depressed"" classification, and this score has a strong positive correlation (0.28) with PSS. Similarly, the STAI score (46.0, Z-score 0.46) classifies the participant as ""anxious,"" and is also positively correlated with PSS (0.31). These two measures alone account for a substantial portion of variance in perceived stress in many populations. The significant drop in GPA from 3.47 to 2.13 in the Fall 2016 semester strongly points to academic difficulties, a common and potent source of stress in university students. Lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) further aligns with elevated stress, given its negative correlation with PSS (-0.15).

Sleep and circadian rhythm data also contribute to this picture. The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. While the Z-score (-0.33) is not notably high relative to the study population, the *classification* itself points to a problematic level of subjective sleep quality. Furthermore, the Fitbit data shows highly variable sleep duration (Z-score 1.65) and a significantly late and moderately variable sleep start time, both of which are common markers of disrupted sleep linked to stress. The low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.12) and lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.24) reflect a less regular heart rate-based circadian rhythm, which can be both a cause and consequence of stress. The extreme peak in heart rate deviation (Z-score 2.76) observed in the late afternoon/early evening suggests periods of intense physiological arousal that may contribute to perceived stress. Finally, higher internet usage (Z-score 1.52) is weakly positively correlated with PSS (0.10).

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Evidence suggesting lower or average perceived stress is present but less compelling in magnitude or correlation. The participant's higher-than-average self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22) are negatively correlated with PSS, which could temper the overall stress experience. The complete absence of substance use across all categories might indicate a lack of reliance on maladaptive coping mechanisms, potentially suggesting better stress management in this domain, or a different profile of stress responses. Engagement in frequent social exercise (Z-score 1.23) is a positive health behavior often associated with lower stress, although its correlation with PSS is very weak (-0.02). Physiologically, a lower resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) and lower mesor (Z-score -0.83) are generally indicators of good cardiovascular health, and their weak positive correlations with PSS suggest they might be associated with slightly lower stress. Additionally, the participant's median sleep duration is significantly longer than average (8h 16m, Z-score 1.34), which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS (-0.06). Lower intradaily variability (Z-score -0.60) in heart rate is also weakly correlated with lower PSS (0.16 correlation means higher IV -> higher PSS, so lower IV -> lower PSS).

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While there are some indicators suggesting average or even lower stress (e.g., happiness, good physical health markers, lack of substance use, long sleep duration), these are largely overshadowed by the substantial evidence for elevated perceived stress. The high scores on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), both strongly correlated with PSS, alongside the dramatic decline in academic performance (GPA), represent significant psychological and situational stressors. Despite a long average sleep duration, the marked variability, very late start time, and disrupted circadian rhythmicity suggest that sleep quality and regularity are compromised, which can perpetuate or exacerbate stress. The prominent late-day physiological arousal peak further indicates a challenged physiological regulation. Given the strength and direct relevance of the CES-D, STAI, and GPA drop as indicators of stress, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population.

36552,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant's profile reveals a complex interplay of psychological traits, physiological dysregulation, and behavioral patterns that collectively point towards elevated perceived stress, despite the presence of several robust coping mechanisms. Psychologically, the participant demonstrates a slightly above-average predisposition to anxiety, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 44.0 (Z-score 0.27), which is classified as ""anxious"" and shows a positive correlation with PSS. This trait anxiety is present alongside slightly below-average depressive symptoms (CESD score 10.0, Z-score -0.34) and above-average self-esteem (score 40.0, Z-score 0.26), suggesting that while anxiety proneness is notable, it is not accompanied by significant depressive symptomatology or impaired self-worth. However, self-reported happiness is below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), negatively correlating with PSS, which implies a potential deficit in subjective well-being that could contribute to perceived stress. Health satisfaction, conversely, is above average (score 5.0, Z-score 0.55), potentially acting as a protective factor.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits significant signs of sympathetic nervous system activation and circadian rhythm disruption. The Resting Heart Rate (64.3 bpm, Z-score 0.73) is notably above the population average, and positively correlated with PSS, indicative of a state of elevated baseline physiological arousal. This is further substantiated by several wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics: Interdaily Stability is significantly low (0.29, Z-score -0.99), Intradaily Variability is notably high (0.72, Z-score 1.23), and the overall Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is low (7.46, Z-score -1.07). These patterns reflect an irregular, fragmented, and blunted daily physiological rhythm, suggesting a lack of robust internal synchronization and potential difficulty in recovering from daily demands. The aggregated hourly heart rate data highlights a particularly salient finding: a pronounced physiological activation in the afternoon, with heart rate deviating 19.92 bpm above the mesor between 3-4 PM (Z-score 1.99). This extreme hourly peak indicates a significant and atypical physiological response during this specific time window, further underscoring a pattern of acute arousal or intense activity. Concurrently, the heart rate deviations during deep sleep hours (2-6 AM) are less negative than average, implying less deep physiological rest even during periods of presumed inactivity.

Sleep patterns are consistently disturbed, contributing to the overall stress profile. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), which positively correlates with PSS. Objective Fitbit data corroborate this, showing a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes (Z-score -1.0). While short, the participant's sleep duration and start times exhibit less variability than the population average (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-score -1.17; Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score -0.75), suggesting a regular but chronically insufficient sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further supports a fixed, yet inadequate, sleep regimen.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in regular solo exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), a positive coping strategy. Substance use is generally low or absent across categories. However, engagement in social activities is below average (socializing 31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62). Time spent watching TV/videos/movies is above average (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64), and reading for pleasure is below average (15 minutes or less, Z-score 0.32). While some daily recreational habits are associated with lower PSS scores in this population, the below-average reading and above-average screen time (TV) could be subtle indicators of less adaptive leisure engagement, particularly given the negative correlation between reading time and PSS.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest that this participant's perceived stress level is in the top half of the study population distribution. The STAI-Trait score, a direct measure of anxiety proneness, is above average (Z-score 0.27) and correlates positively with PSS (r=0.31), indicating a predisposition to higher stress. Subjective well-being is compromised, with below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) which negatively correlates with PSS (r=-0.19), implying that lower happiness is associated with higher perceived stress. Sleep quality is poor, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13, classified as 'Disturbed Sleep'), correlating positively with PSS (r=0.13). Objectively, Fitbit data shows significantly short sleep duration (median 6 hours 23 minutes, Z-score -1.0), which negatively correlates with PSS (r=-0.04), meaning shorter sleep is linked to higher stress.

Physiological markers further bolster this assessment. The participant exhibits an elevated Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.73), which correlates positively with PSS (r=0.14), directly suggesting higher baseline physiological stress. Moreover, there is extensive evidence of circadian rhythm dysregulation: significantly low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.99) and Amplitude (Z-score -1.07) both negatively correlate with PSS (r=-0.11 and r=-0.16 respectively), indicating that less stable and blunted rhythms are associated with higher perceived stress. Concurrently, Intradaily Variability is significantly high (Z-score 1.23) and positively correlates with PSS (r=0.16), implying greater physiological fluctuations within the day are linked to higher stress. The pronounced hourly heart rate deviation observed between 3-4 PM (Z-score 1.99) represents an extreme physiological activation during a specific period, pointing to significant daily demands or acute arousal. Finally, certain daily habits like reading less than average (Z-score 0.32 for ""15 minutes or less"") negatively correlate with PSS (r=-0.21), suggesting less engagement in reading is associated with higher stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Some factors might suggest lower stress, but these appear to be outweighed by the indicators of elevated stress. The participant reports below-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.34) which positively correlate with PSS (r=0.28), implying lower depressive symptoms are associated with lower stress. Above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) negatively correlate with PSS (r=-0.15 and r=-0.08 respectively), indicating these positive psychological resources are linked to lower stress. The participant also engages in frequent exercise alone (Z-score 1.07), a common stress-reducing behavior, though its correlation with PSS is weak (r=0.04). Low substance usage across categories is generally associated with healthier coping. Interestingly, despite chronic sleep shortness, the participant demonstrates lower variability in sleep duration (Z-score -1.17) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.75), and no napping (Z-score -0.86), all of which weakly correlate positively with PSS (r=0.15, r=0.17, r=0.14 respectively), suggesting greater regularity in sleep habits might be associated with slightly lower stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The holistic analysis reveals a predominant pattern indicative of elevated perceived stress. While the participant benefits from protective factors such as higher self-esteem, good health satisfaction, lower depressive symptoms, and consistent exercise, these are largely overshadowed by robust evidence of chronic anxiety, pervasive physiological dysregulation (elevated RHR, significant circadian rhythm disruption, and an extreme afternoon HR peak), and chronic, disturbed sleep patterns. The consistency of these indicators, many of which have significant Z-scores and correlations aligning with higher PSS, strongly points towards a heightened state of perceived stress. The physiological data, particularly the combination of elevated RHR and disrupted circadian markers, offers objective validation for a system under strain. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's PSS score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

63138,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a psychological profile characterized by relatively low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Their Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) score of 8.0 (Z-score: -0.55) classifies them as not depressed, and their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 40.0 (Z-score: -0.13) indicates trait anxiety slightly below the population average. Both measures correlate positively with perceived stress, suggesting these lower scores are indicative of reduced stress levels. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score: 0.55) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: 0.38), both of which show a negative correlation with perceived stress. Self-esteem and trust scores are close to the population mean, suggesting these factors do not significantly contribute to perceived stress for this individual. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with GPAs ranging from 3.81 to 3.94 across multiple semesters.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral patterns, the participant exhibits a mixed profile. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine/liquor, is reported at 1-2 times a week, placing them slightly above the population average for these categories (Z-scores: 1.01 and 0.94, respectively), though correlations with perceived stress are weak. Of more salience is the participant's significantly low engagement in individual exercise (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score: -1.18). Given the positive correlation between individual exercise frequency and perceived stress, this low activity level may contribute to elevated stress. Engagement in other recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos, listening to music, reading, and socializing, is generally below average, with low participation across multiple categories.

Sleep patterns, as derived from Fitbit data, appear remarkably stable and of good duration. The participant's median sleep duration of 8 hours and 21 minutes is significantly above the study population mean (Z-score: 1.45), which weakly correlates with lower perceived stress. Importantly, the variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 66 minutes, Z-score: -0.8) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 58 minutes, Z-score: -0.54) is considerably lower than the population average. Both these stability metrics correlate positively with perceived stress, indicating that less variability is associated with lower stress levels. The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86), further aligning with patterns associated with lower perceived stress. Despite the overall stability, the median sleep start time is notably late at 01:37 AM.

Physiological data reveal distinct circadian rhythm characteristics. The participant exhibits significantly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.16), a measure of rhythm fragmentation, which correlates positively with perceived stress, suggesting a fragmented pattern of activity and rest throughout the day. Conversely, heart rate amplitude (Z-score: 0.88) is above average and negatively correlated with perceived stress, indicating a robust physiological range between peak and trough heart rates. The resting heart rate (62.9 bpm, Z-score: 0.56) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 77.14 bpm, Z-score: 0.44) are slightly above the population average, and both positively correlate with perceived stress, suggesting a minor elevation in baseline physiological arousal. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a delayed physiological trough in the morning, with heart rates remaining below the resting rate until approximately 9:00 AM, and a pronounced peak in heart rate occurring late in the day, specifically between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM (Z-score: 1.1). This pattern is consistent with a late acrophase (5:09 PM), reflecting a delayed and strong daily physiological activation.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant demonstrates strong psychological indicators for lower perceived stress. Their self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD) and trait anxiety (STAI) are below the population average, with both correlating positively with PSS, meaning lower scores align with lower stress. High self-reported happiness and satisfaction with health also suggest a positive psychological state that typically moderates perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits exceptionally healthy sleep patterns, including significantly longer median sleep duration (8 hours 21 minutes) and remarkably low variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time. The absence of daily naps further contributes to a consistent sleep-wake cycle, which is strongly associated with better stress regulation. Physiologically, an above-average heart rate amplitude, negatively correlated with PSS, suggests a robust and adaptable cardiovascular system. Collectively, these self-reported psychological well-being and objective sleep consistency metrics strongly point towards a lower perceived stress level.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite positive psychological and sleep markers, several physiological and behavioral factors suggest potential for elevated perceived stress. The most prominent physiological indicator is the significantly high intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.16), which reflects fragmentation in heart rate patterns throughout the day and has a notable positive correlation with PSS. This suggests an underlying physiological irregularity that can be indicative of stress. Additionally, the participant's resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.56) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor, Z-score: 0.44) are slightly elevated, both positively correlating with PSS, implying a minor increase in baseline physiological arousal. Behaviorally, the participant reports significantly low engagement in individual exercise (Z-score: -1.18), a factor positively correlated with PSS, suggesting this lack of physical activity might contribute to higher stress levels. The distinctive delayed and pronounced late-day heart rate peak observed in the hourly data, coupled with a late acrophase, could also reflect a daily physiological pattern that might be less conducive to effective stress management.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant presents a complex and somewhat contradictory profile. The robust indicators of psychological well-being (low depression and anxiety, high happiness) combined with exemplary objective sleep consistency (long duration, very low variability in duration and timing, no naps) are powerful protective factors against perceived stress. These factors are often central to an individual's subjective experience of stress. While physiological markers such as high intradaily variability and slightly elevated resting heart rate, along with low exercise, point towards potential underlying stress or physiological dysregulation, the subjective and behavioral coping mechanisms around sleep appear to be highly effective. The strong self-reported psychological health and highly structured sleep patterns likely contribute to a lower *perception* of stress, outweighing the physiological and behavioral risk factors that might otherwise indicate higher stress. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, particularly the strong self-reported well-being and objective sleep health, the participant is more likely to fall within the bottom half of the perceived stress distribution.

16654,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a generally favorable psychological profile, characterized by notably low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, as indicated by a CES-D score of 0.0 (Z-score: -1.38) and a STAI score of 34.0 (Z-score: -0.72), respectively. Both scores are well below the population mean, with depressive symptoms being absent and anxiety proneness being low. This robust psychological state is further supported by a slightly above-average self-esteem score of 39.0 (Z-score: 0.11) and high satisfaction with physical health (score 6.0, Z-score: 1.3). These factors, which correlate in directions indicative of lower perceived stress, suggest a resilient psychological foundation. While current happiness is reported as below average (score 3.0, Z-score: -0.53) and negatively correlated with PSS, this appears to be an outlier amidst otherwise strong indicators of psychological well-being. Academic performance is consistently excellent, culminating in a 4.0 GPA, suggesting effective management of academic demands and high functioning.

Sleep patterns present a nuanced picture when integrating self-report and wearable data. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, despite having a negative Z-score (-0.33) relative to the study population, classifies the participant as experiencing ""Disturbed Sleep"" based on general clinical thresholds. However, objective Fitbit data indicates remarkably robust sleep habits: a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score: 0.73), which is above the population average and negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting adequate sleep quantity. Furthermore, sleep duration and sleep start time show notable consistency, with low standard deviations (55 minutes, Z-score: -1.04 for duration; 30 minutes, Z-score: -1.17 for start time). These low variabilities are typically indicative of healthy sleep hygiene, contributing to a stable sleep-wake cycle. The participant does not report napping (Z-score: -0.86), further underscoring a consolidated nighttime sleep pattern.

In terms of daily activities and lifestyle, the participant maintains an active and socially engaged routine. Exercise levels are notably high, particularly exercising with others (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.23) and participating in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 0.91). This high level of physical activity is generally recognized as protective against stress. Socializing with friends is also significantly above average (2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95), suggesting strong social support, although its weak positive correlation with PSS is counter-intuitive and warrants cautious interpretation without further context. Alcohol consumption is slightly above average, with beer and wine/liquor used 1-2 times a week, though correlations with PSS are negligible. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreational habits, such as screen time and listening to music, are largely average or slightly below. However, reading time is low (15 minutes or less, Z-score: 0.32), which is weakly correlated with higher PSS.

Physiological data derived from wearables reveal a highly structured and responsive cardiovascular circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (0.54, Z-score: 1.08) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (0.39, Z-score: 0.56), both indicative of consistent daily physiological patterns and negatively correlated with PSS. A significantly high heart rate amplitude (15.22, Z-score: 1.44) suggests a robust difference between peak daytime activity and trough nighttime rest, which is also negatively correlated with PSS. These metrics collectively point to a well-entrained and healthy circadian system, typically associated with lower stress. While intradaily variability is slightly above average (0.58, Z-score: 0.24) and positively correlated with PSS, suggesting minor fluctuations, its impact is likely overshadowed by the overall stability and amplitude. The participant's resting heart rate of 59.7 bpm (Z-score: 0.18) is slightly above the population average but remains within a healthy range, though its positive correlation with PSS suggests it could be a mild indicator of elevated stress. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show typical diurnal variations, with pronounced drops during night hours (e.g., -24.62 at 5-6 AM) and significant elevations during daytime (e.g., 18.77 at 1-2 PM). Notably, these elevated deviations during active periods (e.g., 1-2 PM, 10-11 PM) generally correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting that a physiologically active and robust daily profile for this individual is linked to lower perceived stress. The acrophase at 5:23 PM indicates a peak in cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon/early evening.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Based on a holistic analysis of the multimodal data, the participant demonstrates a strong preponderance of indicators associated with lower perceived stress, suggesting their PSS score would likely fall into the bottom 50% of the study population.

Evidence supporting a relatively low or average PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial. The participant exhibits remarkably low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z=-1.38) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=-0.72), both of which are strongly and positively correlated with PSS (meaning lower scores on these scales predict lower PSS). High self-esteem (Z=0.11) and high health satisfaction (Z=1.3) also correlate negatively with PSS, further reinforcing this perspective. Behaviorally, the participant engages in high levels of physical exercise and social interaction, which are generally recognized as buffers against stress. Physiologically, robust circadian rhythmicity is evident with high interdaily stability (Z=1.08), strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=0.56), and a pronounced heart rate amplitude (Z=1.44), all negatively correlated with PSS. Objective sleep data indicates ample sleep duration (Z=0.73) and high stability in sleep duration and start times, also generally associated with lower stress despite weak, counter-intuitive population correlations. Furthermore, the participant's excellent academic performance suggests effective coping and functional capacity despite academic demands. The pattern of elevated heart rates during active daytime and early evening periods, when negatively correlated with PSS, suggests that this physiological robustness is associated with lower stress for this individual.

Conversely, evidence for an elevated PSS score (top 50th percentile) is less prominent and often nuanced. The participant reported below-average current happiness (Z=-0.53), which negatively correlates with PSS. The self-reported PSQI score of 6.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" though the objective Fitbit sleep metrics contradict this by showing good duration and stability, and the Z-score for PSQI is negative relative to the population. Slightly above-average intradaily variability (Z=0.24) and resting heart rate (Z=0.18) are weakly positively correlated with PSS, but their magnitudes are not substantial. Low reading time (Z=0.32) also shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, implying higher PSS, but this is a minor behavioral point. The weak, counter-intuitive positive correlations for sleep stability and social engagement with PSS are acknowledged but are given less weight due to their low magnitude and contradiction with established psychological and physiological principles.

Considering the cumulative weight of evidence, particularly the strong psychological indicators of low anxiety and depression, coupled with robust physiological circadian rhythms, high levels of exercise, and objectively adequate, stable sleep, the participant's overall perceived stress level is most likely to be in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

29134,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant demonstrates a notable pattern of significant sleep disturbance, which appears to be the most salient behavioral and physiological characteristic in this dataset. Subjectively, the participant reports poor sleep quality with a PSQI score of 11.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.98, placing them well above the typical range for disturbed sleep in the study population. This subjective experience is strongly corroborated by objective wearable data. Fitbit metrics reveal exceptionally high variability in sleep patterns, with the standard deviation of sleep start time registering a Z-score of 2.2 and sleep duration standard deviation at a Z-score of 1.33. Both of these metrics indicate substantially inconsistent sleep schedules, with a median sleep start time of 01:13:33, which is relatively late. Despite this irregularity, the participant's median sleep duration of 7 hours and 40 minutes (Z-score 0.6) is slightly above the population average, suggesting that the primary challenge lies in the consistency and quality of sleep, rather than insufficient total sleep time. The higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.61) further suggests attempts to compensate for or manage an irregular sleep schedule.

In contrast to the pronounced sleep disturbance, the participant's self-reported psychological well-being appears to be within or favorably above population averages. Scores on the CES-D and STAI scales are slightly below the mean (Z-scores of -0.14 and -0.33 respectively), indicating typical or low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), reported happiness (Z-score 0.55), and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55) are all at or above the population average. The participant also reports higher levels of trust in others (Z-score 0.83). These factors, which generally correlate negatively with perceived stress, present a complex picture when considered alongside the severe sleep disruption.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a high level of physical activity, particularly in organized sports and exercising with others (Z-scores 1.58 and 1.23, respectively). This engagement in physical activity, typically associated with lower stress, may serve as a beneficial coping mechanism. However, the participant also reports higher-than-average consumption of both beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), which could potentially represent less adaptive coping strategies, although the correlations with PSS are weak. Regarding other recreational habits, the participant engages in reading at a higher frequency (Z-score 1.3), a behavior with a moderate negative correlation with perceived stress. Conversely, there is notably low engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and listening to music (Z-score -1.19), which might indicate a reduction in certain forms of social and leisure engagement.

Physiologically, the participant's heart rate data derived from wearables indicates a healthy resting heart rate of 55.4 bpm (Z-score -0.33), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.0) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.18), are largely within the average range, indicating a relatively stable but not overly fragmented daily rhythm of activity. The Mesor (mean heart rate, Z-score -0.56) and Amplitude (Z-score -0.51) are slightly lower than average, suggesting a somewhat blunted overall heart rate variability throughout the day compared to the population. The Acrophase, indicating the peak of heart rate activity, is observed at 5:06 PM, suggesting a relatively late-afternoon or early-evening peak in physiological arousal, which aligns with the observed later sleep start times. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor demonstrate expected nocturnal decreases and diurnal increases, with notable elevations during late morning (10-12pm) and late afternoon/early evening (5-8pm). The overall pattern suggests an individual with good baseline cardiovascular health but a distinct chronobiological preference or schedule, potentially contributing to the observed sleep irregularity.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50%):**

Several data points suggest that the participant might experience lower than average or median perceived stress. The self-reported psychological measures are largely favorable: CES-D and STAI scores are slightly below the population mean, indicating typical or lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (Z-scores of -0.14 and -0.33 respectively). Given their positive correlation with PSS, these lower scores would predict a lower PSS. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), higher reported happiness (Z-score 0.55), and elevated health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) are all negatively correlated with PSS, further indicating a lower likelihood of high perceived stress. The participant also exhibits higher levels of trust (Z-score 0.83). Behaviorally, high engagement in exercise, particularly social exercise and sports (Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58), is generally associated with stress reduction. Similarly, a high frequency of reading (Z-score 1.3) shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS. Physiologically, the low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.33) suggests good physical conditioning, which can act as a buffer against stress, although its specific positive correlation with PSS in this dataset is noted. Circadian rhythm metrics like Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.0) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.39) are average to slightly above average, suggesting reasonable regularity in overall physiological rhythms.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50%):**

The most compelling evidence for an elevated PSS score stems from the profound sleep disturbance. The PSQI score of 11.0, with a Z-score of 1.98, indicates significantly poor subjective sleep quality, a factor strongly associated with increased perceived stress. Objectively, the extreme variability in sleep start times (standard deviation Z-score 2.2) and sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score 1.33) are highly indicative of a chaotic sleep schedule. These sleep irregularity metrics demonstrate positive correlations with PSS, meaning higher variability predicts higher PSS. Additionally, the slightly elevated frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.61) and a later median sleep start time also contribute to a pattern of disrupted sleep, which often accompanies or exacerbates stress. While other self-reported psychological measures are favorable, the PSS measures perceived stress, and chronic sleep disruption is a well-established source of significant stress. The participant's declining GPA across semesters could also be a source of academic stress or a consequence of other stressors, including poor sleep. Higher-than-average alcohol consumption, while weakly correlated with PSS in this sample, could suggest a coping mechanism for underlying stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The participant presents a complex profile with contradictory indicators. On one hand, many self-reported psychological well-being measures (low anxiety/depression symptoms, high self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) and positive health behaviors (high exercise, low recreational drug use, high reading) point towards a lower perceived stress level. On the other hand, the data reveals severe and objectively verifiable sleep disturbance. The PSQI score is clinically significant, and the extreme variability in sleep timing and duration are pronounced, and these specific metrics show positive correlations with PSS. Given that perceived stress is often profoundly impacted by sleep quality and regularity, the severe disruption in sleep patterns is a highly influential factor. While the participant may not report high levels of anxiety or depression, the constant struggle with maintaining a regular and restorative sleep schedule is itself a significant stressor. The declining GPA over time also hints at potential underlying academic pressures or difficulties that could be impacted by or contributing to stress. Therefore, despite several positive psychological indicators, the pervasive and extreme sleep disturbance is a dominant factor that is highly likely to elevate perceived stress.

24029,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a complex profile, demonstrating elevated psychological distress indicators alongside engagement in numerous health-promoting behaviors and some physiological dysregulation. Psychologically, there is evidence of elevated depressive symptoms, as indicated by a CES-D score of 21.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 0.8, which is nearly one standard deviation above the study population mean and is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28). Similarly, trait anxiety is notably high, with a STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86), also positively correlated with perceived stress (0.31). Further supporting this pattern is a lower self-esteem score of 29.0 (Z-score -1.29), more than one standard deviation below the population mean, and negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.15), indicating that lower self-esteem is associated with higher perceived stress in this cohort. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45), which weakly correlates with higher stress. However, the participant reports higher-than-average happiness (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with perceived stress (-0.20), suggesting a potential buffering factor or discrepancy in subjective well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical activity and recreational hobbies. They exercise alone and with others ""three times a week or more,"" with Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23, respectively, and participate in sports at a similarly high frequency (Z-score 1.58). These activities generally show weak negative correlations with perceived stress. The participant also reports significant engagement in recreational screen time, including ""1-2 hours"" of watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and ""1-2 hours"" of video games (Z-score 2.47), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.15 for video games). They also spend more than 4 hours listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and 2-3 hours on a sedentary hobby (Z-score 2.01), both of which show weak correlations with stress. Internet usage, socializing with friends, and reading habits are closer to or below the population mean. Notably, the participant reports no substance usage across categories, with correspondingly low Z-scores, indicating a potentially protective behavioral pattern, although correlations with perceived stress are minimal.

Sleep patterns reveal a complex picture. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, while clinically classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" corresponds to a Z-score of -0.33, indicating that the participant's subjective sleep quality is slightly better than the average for the study population. However, wearable data suggests a median sleep duration of 6 hours 46 minutes (Z-score -0.52), slightly shorter than the population average, which weakly correlates with higher stress. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show a notable increase in Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.09), indicating less stability in physiological rhythms throughout the day, which positively correlates with perceived stress (0.15). Conversely, 24-hour autocorrelation is slightly lower than average (Z-score -0.53), suggesting reduced regularity in daily heart rate patterns, which is negatively correlated with perceived stress (-0.17), implying that less regularity is associated with higher stress. The Mesor (average heart rate) is within the population average (Z-score -0.15), and the amplitude (difference between peak and trough heart rate) is slightly higher (Z-score 0.23). The Acrophase, indicating the peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed at 2:19 PM.

Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal significant patterns of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits profoundly low heart rates during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 11 PM to 1 AM, Z-scores -3.95 to -2.94), with these lower values correlating negatively with perceived stress, suggesting that more pronounced nocturnal deceleration is associated with higher perceived stress in this population. Conversely, the early morning hours (5 AM to 8 AM) demonstrate exceptionally elevated heart rates (Z-scores ranging from 2.0 to 4.77), indicating significant physiological activation relative to the population mean. These markedly high heart rates during morning awakening hours are positively correlated with perceived stress, pointing to an exaggerated physiological response during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. The participant's resting heart rate (54.6 bpm, Z-score -0.42) is slightly lower than the population average, which generally indicates good cardiovascular fitness, but its positive correlation with PSS (0.14) suggests that lower RHR in this context is associated with lower stress.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To assess whether the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution (where the 50th percentile is 22.0), we evaluate the aggregate evidence.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a higher PSS score comes from self-reported psychological measures. The participant's CES-D score (Z=0.8) and STAI score (Z=0.86) are both nearly one standard deviation above the population mean for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, respectively. Both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31). Furthermore, the participant's self-esteem (Z=-1.29) is more than one standard deviation below the mean, and lower self-esteem is negatively correlated with PSS (-0.15), indicating a strong association with elevated perceived stress.

Physiological data also strongly support a higher PSS score. The Intradaily Variability (Z=1.09) is significantly elevated, reflecting less stable daily heart rate patterns, and positively correlates with PSS (0.15). The decreased 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z=-0.53) implies reduced regularity in heart rate rhythms, which correlates negatively with PSS (-0.17), indicating that less rhythm stability is associated with higher stress. Most strikingly, the aggregate hourly heart rate data show extreme physiological arousal in the early morning (5-8 AM, Z-scores up to 4.77), which correlates positively with PSS. Additionally, the profoundly low heart rates during late night (11 PM-1 AM, Z-scores down to -3.95) correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting that abnormally large nocturnal drops are also associated with higher perceived stress. Variability in sleep start time is also slightly elevated (Z=0.36) and positively correlated with PSS (0.17).

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Counterbalancing factors exist but appear to be of lesser magnitude or consistency in their relation to PSS. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z=0.55), which negatively correlates with PSS (-0.20). They also engage in high levels of physical activity and several recreational hobbies (e.g., video games, sports, sedentary hobby), which are generally associated with lower stress and show weak negative correlations with PSS. The participant's PSQI score (Z=-0.33) is slightly better than the population mean, despite its ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification by a general threshold. Their resting heart rate is also slightly lower than average (Z=-0.42), a sign of fitness, and positively correlates with PSS (0.14), implying that a lower RHR is associated with lower stress. Fewer daily naps (Z=-0.86) are also positively correlated with PSS (0.15), suggesting fewer naps are linked to lower stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant engages in several healthy behaviors and reports higher happiness, the robust and consistent evidence from self-reported psychological distress measures (elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, and low self-esteem) points strongly towards an elevated perceived stress level. These psychological indicators have the most direct and generally strongest correlations with PSS. This is further substantiated by significant physiological dysregulation observed in the wearable data, particularly the elevated intradaily heart rate variability, reduced circadian regularity, and pronounced early morning physiological arousal that positively correlates with PSS. The combination of marked psychological distress and clear physiological indicators of stress dysregulation, despite some positive coping behaviors, suggests a heightened overall burden of perceived stress.

Therefore, the participant is likely to have a PSS score in the top half of the study population distribution.

This participant presents a profile characterized by favorable psychological traits, robust health behaviors, and well-regulated physiological patterns, all of which generally correlate with lower perceived stress. Psychologically, the participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Score: 7.0, Z-score: -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Score: 38.0, Z-score: -0.33), both falling below the population mean. Concurrently, self-esteem (Score: 40.0, Z-score: 0.26), current happiness (Score: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55), and satisfaction with physical health (Score: 5.0, Z-score: 0.55) are all reported as above the population average. These positive self-perceptions and emotional states are associated with a reduced propensity for experiencing stress. Behavioral patterns reinforce this healthy profile, with the participant reporting no substance usage and engaging in frequent exercise, specifically exercising alone ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.07) and with others ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.53). Recreational activities include a notable engagement in reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score: 1.3), which has a negative correlation with perceived stress, while screen-based activities like watching TV/videos (Z-score: -1.25) and internet usage (Z-score: -1.16) are reported as minimal, indicating a preference for less passive and often more engaging forms of recreation.

Sleep parameters demonstrate a generally healthy and highly consistent pattern. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 4.0 (Z-score: -1.26), indicating fewer sleep disturbances than the average study participant. While the median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 56 minutes is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.31), the consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation: 61 minutes, Z-score: -0.91) and sleep start time (standard deviation: 73 minutes, Z-score: -0.21) is notably high, with significantly less variability than the study population. High consistency in sleep timing and duration is a key indicator of stable sleep hygiene and is generally associated with reduced stress, with lower standard deviations for both metrics correlating positively with PSS, meaning the participant's low variability would predict lower PSS. The absence of daily napping (Z-score: -0.86) further suggests a consolidated nocturnal sleep pattern.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveal a robust and well-regulated cardiovascular system and strong circadian rhythmicity. The participant exhibits a low resting heart rate of 49.8 bpm (Z-score: -0.99), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, which typically correlates with lower stress. Circadian rhythm parameters show high Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.59, Z-score: 1.49) and low Intradaily Variability (Value: 0.37, Z-score: -1.24), alongside an above-average Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value: 0.41, Z-score: 0.73). These metrics collectively signify a highly regular and structured daily physiological rhythm. The amplitude of heart rate variation (Value: 13.48, Z-score: 0.87) is higher than average, suggesting a distinct physiological differentiation between active and rest periods, further contributing to a well-defined internal clock. These strong circadian patterns, characterized by high stability and low variability, generally correspond to lower perceived stress.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrates a clear and pronounced physiological rhythm throughout the day. Heart rate levels are substantially below the mesor during nighttime and early morning hours, reaching a nadir of -28.41 bpm between 4-5 AM (Z-score: -1.71). Conversely, heart rate significantly elevates above the mesor during active daytime periods, peaking around midday (e.g., 16.9 bpm between 1-2 PM, Z-score: 1.48) and maintaining elevated levels into the evening (e.g., 15.22 bpm between 7-8 PM, Z-score: 0.65). This pattern of clear physiological troughs during rest and pronounced peaks during activity reflects a healthy and adaptable autonomic nervous system response, conducive to effective stress management. The observed negative correlations between higher daytime heart rate deviations and PSS, and positive correlations between lower nighttime heart rate deviations and PSS, align with this participant's distinct and robust physiological activity pattern indicating lower perceived stress.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on a holistic evaluation of the multimodal data, the participant's overall perceived stress level is strongly indicated to be in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%)**:
A substantial body of evidence across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains supports a relatively low or average perceived stress level. The participant consistently reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.33), alongside elevated self-esteem (Z-score: 0.26), happiness (Z-score: 0.55), and health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.55). These positive psychological indicators are typically associated with lower perceived stress, with negative correlations noted for happiness (-0.19) and self-esteem (-0.15). Lifestyle behaviors are highly conducive to stress management, including a complete absence of substance use and frequent engagement in exercise (Z-scores for individual and group exercise are 1.07 and 0.53, respectively). The participant's preference for reading (Z-score: 1.3), which correlates negatively with PSS (-0.21), over high screen-time activities, further suggests healthy coping mechanisms. Sleep quality is self-reported as good (PSQI Z-score: -1.26) and objectively demonstrates remarkable consistency in both duration (Z-score: -0.91) and start time (Z-score: -0.21), factors strongly linked to lower stress despite low correlations with PSS (0.14 and 0.17 for variability, implying less variability means lower PSS). Physiologically, a low resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.99) and highly regular circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 1.49; Intradaily Variability Z-score: -1.24; high Autocorrelation; high Amplitude Z-score: 0.87) all point towards a well-regulated physiological system, which is protective against elevated stress. The consistent and robust hourly heart rate variations, with clear day-night differentiation, further support this pattern, aligning with correlations suggesting a more distinct rhythm is associated with lower PSS.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%)**:
There is minimal evidence to suggest that this participant experiences high perceived stress. The participant's self-reported trust score is below the population average (Z-score: -1.1), but its correlation with PSS is negligible (-0.04), indicating little to no impact on perceived stress. The median sleep duration is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.31), however, this is compensated by exceptional sleep consistency, a stronger indicator of sleep health in relation to stress. The mesor heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.84), but this does not inherently indicate stress and has a very low positive correlation with PSS (0.06). All other physiological metrics and behavioral patterns strongly align with a lower stress profile.

**Holistic Analysis**:
The preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that this participant's perceived stress level is relatively low or average compared to their peers. The consistent pattern of positive psychological well-being, healthy and consistent lifestyle behaviors, high-quality and regular sleep, and robust physiological regulation collectively suggests effective stress management and resilience. The participant's profile contains numerous protective factors against stress, with virtually no significant indicators pointing towards elevated perceived stress.

49086,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a notable profile of psychological resilience and strong academic performance, alongside specific lifestyle and physiological patterns that present a mixed picture regarding perceived stress. Psychologically, the individual reports very low depressive symptoms (CESD score 1.0, Z-score -1.28) and anxiety proneness (STAI score 31.0, Z-score -1.02), both classifying them as ""not depressed"" and ""not anxious,"" respectively. These scores are significantly below the study population average, and their positive correlations with PSS suggest a strong association with lower perceived stress. This is further supported by a high self-esteem score (46.0, Z-score 1.1), which is above the population average and negatively correlated with PSS, implying a buffering effect against stress. Counterbalancing these strengths, the participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7), both weakly associated with higher PSS. Overall, the dominant self-reported psychological traits suggest a robust capacity for managing or not perceiving stress, despite some underlying dissatisfaction.

In terms of academic and lifestyle behaviors, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA across academic semesters (e.g., 3.73-3.88), indicating strong academic performance and potential effective coping strategies in this domain. However, a significant behavioral pattern observed is a notable lack of physical activity, with self-reported frequencies of ""Not at all"" for exercising alone, with others, and sports, corresponding to significantly low Z-scores (ranging from -1.93 to -1.09). This absence of regular exercise is a prominent feature of their lifestyle. Regarding substance use, the participant reports above-average consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score 0.94) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. The individual engages in several recreational activities at or above the population average, including socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95), watching TV/videos, internet usage, and listening to music. The correlations between some of these activities and PSS are weak, but collectively they depict a participant actively engaged in various leisure pursuits, though lacking in physical exercise.

Sleep patterns present a complex profile. While the participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 is often classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" their Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their subjective sleep quality is actually better than the average for the study population. Objectively, wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score 0.15), which is slightly above average and negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting adequate sleep quantity. The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:19:30. However, the variability in sleep start time is slightly below the population average (78 minutes, Z-score -0.11), correlating with lower PSS and indicating relatively consistent bedtimes despite the late hour. Conversely, sleep duration variability (107 minutes, Z-score 0.13) is slightly above average and positively correlated with PSS, suggesting some inconsistency in total sleep received, which could be associated with higher perceived stress.

Physiological arousal and circadian rhythms, as derived from heart rate data, reveal significant patterns. The participant's resting heart rate (56.3 bpm, Z-score -0.22) and MESOR (69.47, Z-score -0.61) are both below the population average and correlate with lower PSS, indicating a generally lower baseline physiological load. However, the hourly aggregated heart rate deviations from the MESOR show pronounced physiological activation during specific nocturnal hours. Specifically, the period from 12-1 AM (Z-score 1.66) and 1-2 AM (Z-score 1.18) exhibits significantly elevated heart rates compared to the population average for those times. This suggests considerable physiological arousal or activity occurring in the very late night/early morning, which is typically a period of deep rest, and aligns with the observed late sleep start time. Conversely, heart rates are markedly low from 6-9 AM (Z-scores up to -1.27), indicating delayed physiological awakening. Regarding overall circadian rhythmicity, Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.16) and Amplitude (Z-score -0.57) are slightly below average, correlating with higher PSS and suggesting a less robust or less stable daily rhythm. However, Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.18) is slightly below average (correlating with lower PSS), suggesting less fragmentation within the day, and the 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.39) is above average (correlating with lower PSS), indicating good overall daily rhythmicity. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, is observed at 5:43 PM, which is within a typical diurnal range.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest the participant's perceived stress level would likely fall into the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution.

Evidence supporting a lower or average perceived stress score (bottom 50th percentile) is primarily driven by strong self-reported psychological indicators. The participant exhibits significantly low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -1.28) and anxiety proneness (STAI Z-score -1.02), both of which are strongly and positively correlated with PSS, implying lower perceived stress. Furthermore, a notably high self-esteem score (Z-score 1.1) is negatively correlated with PSS, serving as a protective factor. These psychological strengths are direct measures of subjective well-being and are highly influential in the perception of stress. Objectively, physiological baselines such as resting heart rate (Z-score -0.22) and MESOR (Z-score -0.61) are below average, correlating with lower PSS, indicating a generally calm physiological state outside of specific periods. Sleep duration is adequate (7h 18m, Z-score 0.15) and sleep start time consistency is better than average (Z-score -0.11), both associating with lower PSS. The consistent high GPA further suggests effective management of academic demands.

Conversely, some evidence points towards potentially elevated stress. The most salient physiological finding is the pronounced and significantly elevated heart rate during the late-night/early-morning hours (12-1 AM, Z-score 1.66; 1-2 AM, Z-score 1.18), indicating a disruption in the typical nocturnal rest pattern. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as a significant lack of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93), along with below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7), could contribute to higher perceived stress. Circadian rhythm metrics like Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.16) and Amplitude (Z-score -0.57) are slightly reduced, correlating with higher PSS.

However, when weighing these factors for *perceived* stress as measured by the PSS, the direct self-reported psychological well-being measures (CESD, STAI, SelfEsteem) carry substantial weight. Despite physiological disruptions and some lifestyle patterns that might predispose to stress, the participant actively reports low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and high self-esteem, which are robust indicators of lower *perceived* psychological burden. It is plausible that while physiological strain exists, the individual's psychological resilience mitigates the subjective experience of stress.

95490,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

This participant's data reveals a complex interplay of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological patterns that together suggest an elevated level of perceived stress. Psychologically, the participant reports a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 47.0, which is above the population average (Z-score = 0.56) and classified as ""anxious."" This trait anxiety shows a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31). Concurrently, self-esteem is somewhat lower than the population mean (Z-score = -0.59), and self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score = -0.53), both of which are weakly to moderately associated with higher perceived stress. While the participant's CES-D score (14.0, Z-score = 0.07) indicates a typical level of depressive symptoms, not classifying them as depressed, the constellation of elevated anxiety, lower self-esteem, and reduced happiness points towards a general psychological vulnerability to stress.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in several activities that could serve as coping mechanisms or lifestyle choices. They report frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07) and substantial time socializing with friends (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.95), both of which are generally associated with positive mental health outcomes. However, the participant also reports higher than average consumption of both beer (Z-score = 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94), which, while not directly correlated with PSS in the provided data, can sometimes indicate less adaptive coping strategies. Academic performance, as indicated by increasing GPAs, suggests competence and potential resilience in the academic domain.

Sleep and circadian rhythm metrics highlight significant irregularities. The participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep quality, even though their Z-score for PSQI is slightly below the population mean (-0.33). Wearable data further supports disturbed sleep patterns, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours 56 minutes (Z-score = -0.30) that is slightly below average and a late median sleep start time of 01:11:34. Crucially, sleep start time variability (standard deviation of 101 minutes, Z-score = 0.40) is above average and positively correlated with PSS (0.17), suggesting inconsistent sleep schedules. Physiologically, circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data reveals a significantly disrupted pattern. Interdaily Stability (0.23, Z-score = -1.48) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.19, Z-score = -1.12) are both markedly low, indicating poor day-to-day regularity in physiological rhythms. Conversely, Intradaily Variability (0.60, Z-score = 0.39) is slightly elevated, suggesting fragmented activity and rest cycles. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (8.34, Z-score = -0.79) is below average, indicating a blunted physiological fluctuation between rest and activity, a pattern frequently observed in stress or dysregulation. The participant's Resting Heart Rate (61.4 bpm, Z-score = 0.39) is also slightly elevated compared to the population mean. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates periods of notable physiological arousal, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM and 5-6 PM), where heart rate is significantly elevated above the individual's average. This overall pattern of irregular and fragmented physiological rhythms, combined with self-reported disturbed sleep and slightly elevated RHR, is consistent with a state of heightened physiological and psychological strain.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on a holistic analysis of the available multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant’s perceived stress level would place them in the **top 50%** of the study population distribution.

Evidence indicating a **high PSS score (top 50th percentile)** includes:
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety:** The participant's STAI score (Z-score = 0.56) is above average, and trait anxiety is moderately correlated with PSS (0.31), directly supporting higher perceived stress.
*   **Lower Self-Esteem and Happiness:** Below-average self-esteem (Z-score = -0.59) and happiness (Z-score = -0.53) are both associated with higher PSS, contributing to a psychological profile consistent with elevated stress.
*   **Significant Circadian Rhythm Disruption:** Multiple wearable-derived metrics strongly indicate irregular physiological rhythms. Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -1.48) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -1.12) are markedly low, reflecting poor day-to-day consistency. Both metrics are negatively correlated with PSS (-0.11 and -0.17, respectively), meaning lower stability/autocorrelation is associated with higher PSS. The relatively low amplitude of heart rate rhythm (Z-score = -0.79), also negatively correlated with PSS (-0.16), points to a blunted physiological response.
*   **Increased Physiological Variability and Arousal:** Intradaily Variability (Z-score = 0.39) is slightly elevated and positively correlated with PSS (0.16), suggesting fragmented activity/rest cycles. The Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = 0.39) is somewhat above average and positively correlated with PSS (0.14). Hourly heart rate data shows pronounced peaks in the afternoon/evening, indicating heightened physiological arousal at these times.
*   **Inconsistent Sleep Patterns:** The participant exhibits above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 0.40), which is positively correlated with PSS (0.17). While the PSQI Z-score is slightly below average for poor sleep, the reported score of 6.0 still indicates disturbed sleep quality based on clinical cutoffs, which is often associated with stress.

Evidence indicating a **low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile)** is less prominent:
*   **Average Depressive Symptoms:** The CES-D score is near the population average (Z-score = 0.07), suggesting no elevated depressive symptom burden, which might otherwise contribute to stress.
*   **Academic Achievement:** Consistent and increasing GPA indicates strong academic performance, potentially mitigating academic-related stress.
*   **Engagement in Positive Coping Strategies:** The participant frequently engages in solitary exercise (Z-score = 1.07) and socializes with friends (Z-score = 0.95), both of which can serve as buffers against stress.

Holistically, the strong and consistent evidence from trait anxiety, lower self-esteem and happiness, and especially the pronounced and multifactorial physiological dysregulation of circadian rhythms (very low Interdaily Stability, Autocorrelation, and Amplitude, along with elevated Intradaily Variability and RHR), collectively outweigh the indicators for lower stress. The significant physiological disruptions and psychological vulnerabilities align robustly with an elevated perception of stress. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's PSS score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

90079,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"This participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and physiological responses that, in aggregate, suggest a notable level of perceived stress. While self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.07) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=-0.33) are within normative ranges, indicating an absence of clinical levels of these specific mental health conditions, other psychological indicators present vulnerabilities. The participant reports somewhat lower levels of self-esteem (Z=-0.59) and happiness (Z=-0.53), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, a significantly low score on the trust measure (Z=-1.42) suggests a lower propensity to trust others, though its correlation with PSS is weak. Health satisfaction is near the population mean (Z=-0.2). Academically, the participant demonstrates an improving GPA trend. Lifestyle behaviors indicate low substance use across all categories (all Z-scores are notably negative), and consistent engagement in exercise, particularly with others (Z=0.53), which are generally considered adaptive coping strategies. However, engagement in some other recreational activities like watching TV/videos (Z=-1.25), video games (Z=-0.56), and reading (Z=-0.67) is comparatively low.

A significant area of concern emerges from the participant's sleep patterns, both subjectively and objectively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z=0.13) classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep, which is consistent with objective wearable data. The median sleep duration of 5 hours and 54 minutes (Z=-1.59) is substantially below the population average, indicating chronic sleep deprivation. Moreover, there is above-average variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 138 minutes, Z=0.84) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 104 minutes, Z=0.46), reflecting an inconsistent and potentially dysregulated sleep schedule. These patterns of insufficient and irregular sleep are well-established correlates of heightened stress.

Physiological data derived from heart rate metrics further underscore a state of physiological dysregulation. The participant displays markedly compromised circadian rhythmicity, characterized by significantly low interdaily stability (Z=-1.65) and weak 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=-1.54), indicating a lack of day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns. Concurrently, intradaily variability is significantly elevated (Z=1.44), suggesting fragmentation or greater irregularity within the daily heart rate rhythm. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is notably blunted (Z=-1.37), implying a reduced physiological range between activity and rest states. The mean heart rate (Mesor, Z=0.41) and especially the resting heart rate (Z=0.89) are both elevated relative to the population, consistent with a generally heightened state of physiological arousal. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinctive pattern: during early morning hours (approximately 4-7 AM), heart rate levels are considerably higher than expected for these typical rest periods (with Z-scores peaking at 1.75 for 6-7 AM), suggesting an inability to fully de-arouse or recover physiologically during sleep. Conversely, some periods in the mid-day to late afternoon (e.g., 4-6 PM) show heart rate deviations that are lower than the population average, potentially indicating a relative blunting of physiological activity during typical wakeful periods. This combination of impaired circadian rhythmicity, elevated baseline arousal, and heightened heart rate during rest points towards a dysregulated autonomic nervous system, a common physiological manifestation of chronic stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence across multiple domains indicates that this participant is likely experiencing elevated levels of perceived stress, placing them in the top half of the study population for PSS.

1.  **Physiological Dysregulation:** The most compelling evidence comes from the wearable-derived heart rate metrics. The participant exhibits significantly low interdaily stability (Z=-1.65) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=-1.54), along with significantly high intradaily variability (Z=1.44) and a blunted amplitude (Z=-1.37). All these circadian dysregulation markers have correlations with PSS (negative for stability/autocorrelation/amplitude, positive for variability), strongly suggesting higher stress. The elevated resting heart rate (Z=0.89) also correlates positively with PSS. Most notably, the participant shows significantly elevated heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., 6-7 AM, Z=1.75), which consistently correlates positively with PSS, indicating heightened physiological arousal during typical rest periods.
2.  **Sleep Disturbance:** Both self-reported (PSQI score 7.0, indicating disturbed sleep) and objective sleep data are highly indicative of stress. The participant's median sleep duration is significantly short (5 hours 54 minutes, Z=-1.59), and variability in both sleep duration (Z=0.84) and sleep start time (Z=0.46) is above average. The positive PSS correlations for sleep duration and sleep start time variability further link these patterns to higher perceived stress.
3.  **Psychological Vulnerabilities:** While not meeting criteria for depression or anxiety, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (Z=-0.59) and happiness (Z=-0.53). Both of these traits negatively correlate with PSS, meaning lower scores here would contribute to higher perceived stress. Lower trust (Z=-1.42) also aligns with a potentially less resilient psychological profile.
4.  **Behavioral Patterns:** Low engagement in activities like reading (Z=-0.67) and video games (Z=-0.56) shows negative correlations with PSS, implying higher PSS for individuals with less engagement in these activities.

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Fewer indicators support a low or median perceived stress level.

1.  **Mental Health Symptoms:** The participant's CESD (Z=0.07) and STAI (Z=-0.33) scores are within normative, non-depressed, and non-anxious ranges, respectively. These scores generally correlate positively with PSS, meaning lower scores would suggest lower perceived stress.
2.  **Adaptive Behaviors:** The participant engages in moderate exercise, particularly exercising with others (Z=0.53), and abstains from substance use, which are generally stress-reducing behaviors.
3.  **Hourly HR Patterns:** Some afternoon hours show heart rate deviations that are lower than population averages, with negative PSS correlations (e.g., 1-2 PM Z=-0.38, PSS Corr -0.17), which might indicate relatively lower stress during these specific periods.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The cumulative weight of evidence strongly points towards a high level of perceived stress. The extensive and pronounced physiological dysregulation, particularly in circadian rhythms and resting/early morning heart rate, along with severe objective sleep deprivation and irregularity, are powerful indicators often associated with elevated perceived stress. These objective measures are complemented by self-reported sleep disturbance and some psychological vulnerabilities (lower self-esteem, happiness, trust). While the participant shows healthy coping mechanisms through exercise and lack of substance use, and does not report clinical levels of anxiety or depression, these protective factors appear insufficient to offset the pervasive signs of physiological and sleep-related stress. The Z-scores for several critical metrics (e.g., interdaily stability, intradaily variability, median sleep duration, early morning HR deviations) are highly salient and consistently align with a higher PSS score based on the provided population correlations. Therefore, the participant is most likely to have a PSS score in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

22842,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant's data reveal a multifaceted profile characterized by elevated psychological distress and significant sleep dysregulation, alongside a mixed physiological and behavioral landscape. Several self-reported measures indicate a predisposition towards higher perceived stress. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms, scoring 20 on the CES-D (Z-score 0.7), which is classified as ""Depressed"" and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress. Similarly, trait anxiety is elevated with a STAI score of 46 (Z-score 0.46), classified as ""anxious,"" and also positively correlated with perceived stress. Self-reported happiness is below average (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), and lower happiness correlates with higher perceived stress. While self-esteem is approximately average (Z-score -0.31), satisfaction with physical health is notably high (Score 5.44, Z-score 0.88), which typically correlates with lower perceived stress, offering a contrasting protective factor amidst other indicators of distress.

Sleep patterns present a prominent area of concern for perceived stress. The participant reports significant subjective sleep disturbance, indicated by a PSQI score of 10 (Z-score 1.52), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed"" and strongly correlating with higher perceived stress. Objective Fitbit data corroborate issues with sleep regularity, despite a relatively high median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score 0.83), which typically correlates with lower stress. However, both sleep duration standard deviation (133 minutes, Z-score 0.73) and, notably, sleep start time standard deviation (164 minutes, Z-score 1.79) are substantially elevated. High variability in sleep timing and duration are positively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, the participant exhibits a very high frequency of napping (mean daily naps 0.28, Z-score 2.4), which also correlates positively with perceived stress. These objective metrics, despite adequate sleep quantity, strongly suggest compromised sleep quality and regularity, aligning with the self-reported poor sleep.

Physiological markers derived from wearable data reveal a mixed picture regarding daily arousal and circadian rhythms. The participant's resting heart rate (54.2 bpm, Z-score -0.47) is slightly below the population average, and lower RHR generally correlates with lower perceived stress. However, key circadian rhythm parameters indicate irregularity: interdaily stability is low (0.3, Z-score -0.9), and amplitude is also low (8.7, Z-score -0.67), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, implying that less stable and less robust daily rhythms are associated with higher stress. Intradaily variability is also below average (0.46, Z-score -0.6), which, given its positive correlation with PSS, would suggest lower perceived stress. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with the acrophase occurring at 6:03 PM, indicating peak physiological activity in the early evening. However, there are elevated heart rate deviations during the very early hours of the typical sleep period (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score 1.49), suggesting some physiological arousal prior to the onset of deeper sleep, which subsequently drops as expected.

Behavioral habits reflect a tendency towards solitary activities and specific recreational choices. The participant reports exercising alone frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07), which interestingly shows a positive correlation with perceived stress in the study population. Conversely, engagement in exercise with others and sports is low. Recreational habits show significantly high engagement in video games (""31 minutes an hour,"" Z-score 1.71), which correlates negatively with perceived stress, potentially serving as a coping mechanism. Conversely, reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score -0.67), and lower reading engagement correlates with higher perceived stress. Substance use is generally low across all categories, indicating these are not significant contributing factors to stress. Academic performance (GPA) has varied, with a notable decrease in the most recent semester (2.37).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for High PSS (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits a cluster of self-reported psychological states strongly indicative of elevated perceived stress. These include elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z=0.7), elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.46), and lower self-reported happiness (Z=-0.53), all of which are directly correlated with higher PSS scores. A significant contributor to perceived stress appears to be sleep disturbance, as evidenced by a clinically significant PSQI score (Z=1.52) and marked objective sleep irregularity. Specifically, high variability in sleep duration (Z=0.73) and particularly sleep start time (Z=1.79), coupled with frequent napping (Z=2.4), are all positively correlated with higher PSS. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm analysis from wearable data points to less robust and less stable daily rhythms, with low interdaily stability (Z=-0.9) and low amplitude (Z=-0.67), both associated with higher perceived stress. Behavioral patterns like frequent exercise alone (Z=1.07) and not engaging in reading (Z=-0.67) also align with factors correlated with higher stress. The drop in GPA in the most recent semester might also reflect increased academic stress.

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS (Bottom 50%):**
Some factors present in the participant's data suggest a lower or average perceived stress level. These include a higher-than-average self-reported satisfaction with physical health (Z=0.88), which correlates negatively with PSS. Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z=-0.47), and lower RHR typically correlates with lower PSS. Intradaily variability is also lower than average (Z=-0.6), which is associated with lower PSS. Objectively, median sleep duration is relatively high (Z=0.83), a factor generally associated with lower perceived stress. In terms of recreational activities, the participant's significantly high engagement in video games (Z=1.71) correlates negatively with PSS, suggesting it might act as a buffer or coping mechanism against stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite the presence of some factors that would typically indicate lower perceived stress, such as high health satisfaction, a lower resting heart rate, and high video game engagement, these appear to be substantially outweighed by the numerous and potent indicators of elevated psychological distress and sleep dysregulation. The participant's self-reported ""Depressed"" CES-D classification, ""anxious"" STAI classification, and subjectively ""Disturbed Sleep"" from the PSQI are strong, direct measures of psychological discomfort that are highly associated with perceived stress. These subjective experiences are objectively supported by significant variability in sleep timing and disrupted circadian rhythm parameters. The high frequency of napping further underscores issues with consolidated sleep and overall sleep health. The weight of evidence, particularly from the self-reported mental health and sleep quality measures, combined with the objective sleep irregularity and disrupted circadian patterns, strongly suggests that the participant is experiencing a level of perceived stress that is higher than the average study population.

14279,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and physiological profile, revealing both protective factors against perceived stress and areas that may contribute to it. Psychologically, the participant reports lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CESD score 5.0, Z-score -0.86, classified as 'not depressed') and trait anxiety (STAI score 38.0, Z-score -0.33, classified as 'not anxious'). Both of these measures show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress (PSS) in the study population, suggesting a lower predisposition to stress based on these enduring traits. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.26), which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS, potentially acting as a minor buffer. However, the participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with health (Z-score -0.37), although these indicators have weaker correlations with PSS. A notably low score on trust (Z-score -1.74) is also observed, though its correlation with PSS is very weak.

Regarding sleep and circadian patterns, a notable discrepancy exists between objective and subjective measures. Objectively, Fitbit data indicates a significantly longer median sleep duration (8 hours 11 minutes, Z-score 1.24) compared to the study population, coupled with below-average variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.19) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.37). These metrics point to a consistent and ample sleep schedule. Paradoxically, the participant self-reports clinically significant sleep disturbance on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), suggesting a subjective experience of poor sleep quality despite objective consistency and quantity. Physiologically, circadian rhythmicity derived from heart rate data is robust, evidenced by above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.58), significantly strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81), and a prominent amplitude (Z-score 1.11) in daily heart rate fluctuations. Autocorrelation and amplitude, both strong indicators of a stable physiological rhythm, show weak to moderate negative correlations with PSS, implying a well-structured circadian system may be associated with lower perceived stress. However, above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.53), which has a weak positive correlation with PSS, suggests some fragmentation in physiological activity patterns within the day.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a clear diurnal rhythm, with heart rate significantly dropping during typical sleep hours and rising considerably during the day. Specific periods of elevated heart rate deviation from the mesor are evident, particularly during late morning to early afternoon (10 AM-1 PM, with a peak Z-score of 2.19 at 12-1 PM) and again in the early evening (6-7 PM, Z-score 1.87). These peaks indicate periods of heightened physiological arousal or activity. The participant's resting heart rate (59.0 BPM, Z-score 0.1) is within an average range. In terms of lifestyle, the participant demonstrates consistent high academic performance (GPA consistently above 3.75) and engages in above-average levels of physical activity, especially sports (Z-score 0.91) and exercising with others (Z-score 0.53). Conversely, engagement in solitary recreational activities such as listening to music (Z-score -1.19), reading (Z-score -0.67), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96) is notably below average. While the PSS correlations for these activities are generally weak, reduced engagement in potentially stress-reducing solitary activities could be a contributing factor to overall stress levels. Alcohol consumption, specifically wine or liquor, is slightly above average (Z-score 0.94).

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

To determine whether the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the totality of the evidence. The population PSS has a median of 22.0.

Evidence suggesting a **lower or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile)** is substantial. The participant reports significantly lower-than-average depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33). Both of these psychological traits exhibit moderate positive correlations with PSS, indicating that lower scores on these measures generally correspond to lower perceived stress. Objectively, Fitbit data demonstrates robust sleep patterns with significantly above-average sleep duration (8 hours 11 minutes, Z-score 1.24) and high consistency in both sleep duration and start times. Furthermore, the participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythm is notably strong, as indicated by a high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81) and amplitude (Z-score 1.11). These strong circadian metrics show weak to moderate negative correlations with PSS, suggesting a well-regulated physiological system that typically buffers against stress. The participant also maintains a high GPA and engages in regular exercise, which are generally associated with adaptive coping and well-being.

Conversely, evidence pointing towards a **higher PSS score (top 50th percentile)** primarily stems from subjective experiences. Despite objectively excellent sleep, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" on the PSQI (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), a qualitative indicator that often correlates with perceived distress. Additionally, self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.37) are below average, albeit with weak correlations to PSS. The significantly low trust score (Z-score -1.74) may also contribute to interpersonal stress, though its PSS correlation is minimal. Physiologically, while the overall circadian rhythm is strong, above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.53) has a weak positive correlation with PSS, potentially suggesting some daily fragmentation contributing to stress. Furthermore, specific periods of high physiological arousal are observed during the day, which, while not definitively stress-related, could be indicative of a heightened physiological response.

**Holistic Analysis:** While there are clear indicators of subjective distress (disturbed sleep perception, lower happiness/health satisfaction), the most robust and strongly correlated measures—namely, the significantly low levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CESD and STAI), combined with highly regular and robust physiological circadian rhythms (Autocorrelation and Amplitude)—collectively present a strong case for lower overall perceived stress. The objective physiological and enduring psychological trait data, with their consistent and moderately strong correlations acting in the direction of lower PSS, outweigh the less extreme Z-scores and weaker correlations of the indicators suggesting higher stress, even when considering the qualitative ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification from the PSQI. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population's PSS distribution.

28327,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable pattern of elevated psychological distress and compromised well-being, as evidenced by multiple self-report measures. Specifically, scores on the CES-D (Z=2.05) and STAI-Trait (Z=1.65) indicate significantly higher depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety, respectively, compared to the study population. Both of these measures show a moderate positive correlation with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports notably lower self-esteem (Z=-1.71), reduced overall happiness (Z=-1.61), and significantly lower satisfaction with physical health (Z=-1.86). While these self-report measures have weaker inverse correlations with perceived stress, their combined deviation from the population mean suggests a broad constellation of psychological vulnerabilities. The observed decline in academic performance, from a GPA of 3.81 to 3.30 over three semesters, further indicates potential academic strain or difficulty in maintaining prior levels of achievement, which could contribute to or be a consequence of elevated stress.

Sleep patterns appear disturbed despite an average sleep duration. The participant reports significantly poorer subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z=1.05), classifying them as having 'Disturbed Sleep'. This finding is particularly salient given that the median Fitbit-recorded sleep duration is 7 hours and 37 minutes (Z=0.54), which is slightly above the population average and weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress. However, the median sleep start time is relatively late at 00:54:00. Variability in both sleep duration (Z=-0.29) and sleep start time (Z=-0.33) is close to the population mean, suggesting moderate consistency in the timing and duration of sleep despite the late onset. The slightly increased frequency of daily naps (Z=0.61), which weakly positively correlates with perceived stress, might serve as a compensatory behavior for underlying sleep difficulties or fatigue stemming from disturbed sleep quality rather than insufficient duration.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological data reveals a complex pattern in circadian rhythm and heart rate. The participant shows a relatively stable interdaily rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z=0.67) but exhibits moderately elevated intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z=1.02), which weakly correlates positively with perceived stress. This suggests that while daily routines might be somewhat consistent, there are pronounced fluctuations in physiological arousal within each day. The heart rate mesor is average (Z=0.38), and the resting heart rate is also within the average range (60.2 bpm, Z=0.24). However, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is moderately high (Z=1.04), which typically signifies robust physiological regulation and weakly correlates negatively with perceived stress. Despite this, the aggregated hourly heart rate data indicates significant physiological activation during evening and late-night hours, with deviations from the mesor peaking sharply between 6 PM and 9 PM (7-8 PM: +24.36 bpm, Z=2.24; 6-7 PM: +22.95 bpm, Z=1.81). Crucially, this elevated heart rate extends late into the night, with a substantial deviation of +12.7 bpm (Z=1.38) observed between 11 PM and 12 AM. This pattern of sustained late-day and pre-sleep physiological arousal is highly suggestive of heightened sympathetic activity, potentially impeding sleep onset and contributing to the self-reported disturbed sleep and overall perceived stress. The heart rate does show a pronounced nocturnal dip, reaching its lowest point between 7 AM and 8 AM (Z=-1.15), although this aligns with the late median sleep start time and may indicate a delayed physiological trough.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports slightly above-average consumption of beer (Z=1.01) and wine or liquor (Z=0.94), but no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Engagement in physical activity, including exercising alone (Z=0.32), exercising with others (Z=0.53), and participation in sports (Z=0.91), is around or slightly above population averages. Daily recreational habits indicate less engagement in passive screen time like watching TV/videos (Z=-1.25) or playing video games (Z=-0.56), and less time socializing with friends (Z=-0.62) compared to the general student population. Conversely, the participant reports significantly higher engagement in listening to music (Z=1.13). This pattern of recreational activities suggests a potential preference for solitary leisure, which may or may not provide adequate social buffering or stress-reducing outlets.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits a substantial collection of indicators associated with elevated perceived stress. Self-report measures show significantly higher depressive symptoms (CESD Z=2.05) and trait anxiety (STAI Z=1.65), both of which are moderately positively correlated with PSS. Concurrently, there are notable deficits in self-esteem (Z=-1.71), happiness (Z=-1.61), and health satisfaction (Z=-1.86), conditions often linked to higher stress vulnerability. The participant reports significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z=1.05), a well-established consequence and contributor to perceived stress. Physiologically, the moderately elevated intradaily heart rate variability (Z=1.02), which weakly positively correlates with PSS, suggests internal physiological fluctuations. Most compellingly, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals significant physiological arousal during evening and late-night hours (e.g., 7-8 PM Z=2.24, 11-12 AM Z=1.38). This sustained physiological activation, particularly preceding and around typical sleep times, is a strong physiological marker consistent with heightened stress levels, likely impacting restorative processes and contributing to the self-reported sleep disturbance. The declining trend in GPA further suggests academic pressure or struggle, a common stressor for university students.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Some physiological and behavioral metrics, while fewer, suggest elements that might buffer against stress or indicate average functioning. The participant's interdaily heart rate stability (Z=0.67) is slightly above average, and heart rate amplitude (Z=1.04) is robust, which are generally positive indicators of circadian health and adaptability. These metrics have weak negative correlations with PSS, suggesting a potential inverse relationship with perceived stress. The median sleep duration (7 hours 37 minutes, Z=0.54) is slightly above the population average, and the consistency in sleep duration and start time is average. The resting heart rate (Z=0.24) is also within the normal range. Moderate engagement in exercise and average consistency in sleep patterns could be considered protective factors.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite some indicators of physiological robustness (e.g., heart rate amplitude) and average sleep consistency, the overwhelming evidence from self-report measures and critical physiological patterns points to significantly elevated perceived stress. The high scores on measures of depression and anxiety, combined with low self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, paint a clear picture of psychological strain that directly correlates with higher perceived stress. This is physiologically corroborated by pronounced and sustained heart rate elevations during evening and late-night hours, which would likely contribute to the reported disturbed sleep and subjective feelings of being stressed. The cumulative impact of these psychological and physiological stressors, particularly those strongly associated with PSS, outweighs the few average or protective factors. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's perceived stress level falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

52302,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a nuanced psychological profile, characterized by generally favorable self-reported well-being alongside slightly elevated trait anxiety. While depressive symptoms (CESD score 7.0, Z-score -0.66) are notably below the population average, and self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and self-esteem (Z-score 0.11) are above average, the individual reports slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 43.0, Z-score 0.17). This trait anxiety is moderately correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, a decline in GPA across academic semesters (from 3.78 to 3.24) suggests potential academic challenges that could contribute to stress, though direct correlations with PSS are not provided for GPA. Overall, the balance of psychological indicators suggests a foundation of resilience with a baseline propensity for anxiety.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates a health-conscious approach to substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for all categories, with Z-scores well below the population mean. Physical activity levels are consistently above average across various forms of exercise, including exercising alone (Z-score 0.32), with others (Z-score 0.53), and particularly in sports participation (Z-score 0.91). These exercise habits are generally associated with stress reduction. Recreational habits reveal a high engagement in digital media, with significantly above-average time spent watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score 1.71), as well as above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.85). Socializing with friends is also significantly high (Z-score 1.74). Conversely, reading engagement is notably low (Z-score -0.67). While high video game usage is weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress, low reading engagement and high internet usage show weak positive correlations, suggesting a mixed impact of recreational choices on stress levels.

The participant's sleep patterns, derived from both self-report and wearable data, show a combination of strengths and irregularities. Subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" though its Z-score of -0.33 indicates it is slightly better than the population average. Objectively, median sleep duration is significantly longer than the population mean (8 hours 6 minutes, Z-score 1.14), which is typically associated with better well-being. However, there is notable irregularity in sleep habits, with both sleep duration (standard deviation of 123 minutes, Z-score 0.51) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 103 minutes, Z-score 0.43) exhibiting higher than average variability. Such irregularity is weakly positively correlated with perceived stress. Additionally, the participant engages in more frequent napping than average (Z-score 0.7), which is also weakly positively correlated with perceived stress and may reflect a compensatory mechanism or underlying sleep fragmentation despite long nocturnal sleep.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal a robust yet sometimes active cardiovascular profile. The participant exhibits a remarkably low resting heart rate (52.5 bpm, Z-score -0.67), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, which is generally associated with lower physiological stress. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show a well-defined rhythm, with an above-average amplitude (Z-score 0.5) and slightly above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.14), both weakly negatively correlated with perceived stress. Intradaily variability is significantly lower than average (Z-score -0.95), suggesting a more stable and less fragmented physiological pattern within the day. However, interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z-score -0.33), indicating minor day-to-day variability in the heart rate rhythm. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern with pronounced nocturnal troughs, reaching its lowest point between 5-6 AM (Z-score -0.61), and distinct daytime peaks. Notably, physiological activity is significantly elevated above population averages during certain periods, particularly between 1-3 PM (Z-scores up to 1.82) and later in the evening between 9-11 PM (Z-scores up to 1.04). This sustained elevation of heart rate into the late evening hours could potentially interfere with the physiological preparation for sleep.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median Perceived Stress (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several strong indicators consistent with lower or average perceived stress. Psychologically, their depressive symptom load is well below average (CESD Z-score -0.66), and self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and self-esteem (Z-score 0.11) are above the mean, all of which correlate negatively with PSS. Behaviorally, a complete absence of substance use and consistently high engagement in physical exercise (e.g., sports Z-score 0.91) represent healthy coping mechanisms. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is notably low (Z-score -0.67), signaling good cardiovascular health and resilience, which strongly correlates negatively with PSS. Objective sleep metrics show significantly longer median sleep duration (Z-score 1.14), and a highly stable intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score -0.95), along with a robust circadian amplitude and 24-hour autocorrelation, all of which are associated with lower perceived stress.

**Evidence for High Perceived Stress (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, certain aspects of the participant's data suggest potential for elevated perceived stress. The self-reported trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17) is slightly above average and is moderately positively correlated with PSS. The observed decline in GPA over time could also be a significant academic stressor. Sleep patterns exhibit higher than average variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.51) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.43), and there is more frequent napping (Z-score 0.7); these irregularities are weakly positively correlated with PSS. Behavioral habits include below-average reading engagement and above-average internet usage, both weakly positively correlated with higher PSS. Physiologically, a slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.33) and notably elevated heart rate activity sustained into the late evening (e.g., 9-11 PM Z-scores > 0.8) indicate some physiological irregularity and sustained arousal that could contribute to perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When evaluating the totality of evidence, the indicators pointing towards lower or average perceived stress are more numerous, robust, and in some cases, exhibit stronger associations than those suggesting higher stress. The combination of significantly low depressive symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, consistent engagement in physical exercise, excellent cardiovascular fitness (low RHR), and sufficiently long sleep duration are substantial protective factors against stress. While the elevated trait anxiety and sleep irregularity are notable and potential sources of stress, they are largely counterbalanced by the participant's overall psychological resilience and healthy physiological functioning. The participant's profile is more aligned with an individual who effectively manages or experiences lower levels of stress relative to their peers.

46418,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant presents a complex profile characterized by a blend of notable physiological resilience and self-reported subjective distress. An analysis of self-reported psychological measures indicates moderate levels of depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 18.0 (Z-score 0.49), which is classified as ""Depressed"" and shows a positive correlation with perceived stress. Conversely, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is low at 38.0 (Z-score -0.33), classified as ""not anxious,"" a factor typically associated with lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is average (Z-score -0.03), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55). Health satisfaction is notably low, with a score of 2.67 (Z-score -1.20), suggesting a significant perception of poorer physical well-being than the population average. Behaviorally, the participant engages in high levels of physical activity, particularly exercising with others (Z-score 1.23) and sports (Z-score 1.58), both of which are generally considered protective against stress. Alcohol consumption, including beer and wine/liquor, is moderately elevated (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively). Daily recreation habits show a higher engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and lower engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and listening to music (Z-score -0.72).

Regarding sleep, a notable discrepancy exists between subjective and objective measures. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0 (Z-score 1.98) is very high, classifying the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating significant subjective difficulties with sleep quality over the past month. Despite this subjective disturbance, objective Fitbit data reveal generally consistent and adequate sleep patterns. The median sleep duration is 7 hours and 44 minutes (Z-score 0.69), which is slightly above the population average. Moreover, sleep duration variability (standard deviation of 64 minutes, Z-score -0.84) and sleep start time variability (standard deviation of 52 minutes, Z-score -0.68) are both lower than average, suggesting a highly regular and consistent sleep schedule. The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86).

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a robust and stable circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability (IS) is high at 0.53 (Z-score 1.0), suggesting consistent daily patterns in physiological activity. Intradaily Variability (IV) is significantly low at 0.3 (Z-score -1.73), indicating fewer rapid physiological shifts within the day and a more stable internal state. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is high at 15.07 (Z-score 1.39), further demonstrating a strong and well-defined circadian rhythm with clear distinctions between peak and trough activity. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs at 5:55 PM. Resting heart rate is average at 57.8 bpm (Z-score -0.04). An examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced daily pattern: heart rate is significantly below the mesor during early morning hours, particularly between 6-7 AM (Z-score -0.82) and 7-8 AM (Z-score -1.24), indicative of a relaxed state often associated with the end of sleep or early waking. Conversely, significant physiological arousal is observed in the late afternoon and early evening, with heart rate deviations peaking dramatically between 5-6 PM (26.09, Z-score 2.27) and remaining elevated between 6-7 PM (22.76, Z-score 1.78) and 9-10 PM (15.4, Z-score 1.28). These peaks represent substantial physiological activity or stress responses during these periods.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several significant characteristics and behaviors associated with lower perceived stress. Their trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is low (Z-score -0.33), and this measure has a moderate positive correlation (0.31) with PSS, meaning lower trait anxiety is linked to lower PSS. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a remarkably stable and robust circadian rhythm: Intradaily Variability is very low (Z-score -1.73, positive correlation with PSS of 0.16), implying fewer rapid physiological fluctuations and thus potentially lower stress. The heart rate rhythm's Amplitude is high (Z-score 1.39, negative correlation with PSS of -0.17), indicating a strong physiological rhythm and resilience. Sleep patterns, while subjectively disturbed, are objectively consistent in duration (Z-score 0.69) and timing (low standard deviations for duration and start time, Z-scores -0.84 and -0.68 respectively; positive correlations with PSS of 0.14 and 0.17 respectively, meaning lower variability suggests lower PSS). High engagement in sports (Z-score 1.58, negative correlation with PSS of -0.13) and exercise generally serve as significant stress buffers. These objective physiological and behavioral markers, with their correlations to PSS, strongly suggest a capacity for effective stress regulation.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several key indicators point towards an elevated level of perceived stress. The most prominent is the Perceived Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0 (Z-score 1.98), which is exceptionally high and classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" As PSS measures *perceived* stress, the subjective experience of poor sleep, irrespective of objective sleep metrics, is a direct and significant contributor to a higher PSS score. Furthermore, the participant reports moderately elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score 18.0, Z-score 0.49), a measure that has a moderate positive correlation (0.28) with PSS. Low overall health satisfaction (Z-score -1.20) also tends to be associated with increased perceived stress. The pronounced peaks in hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor, particularly the very high arousal in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM with a Z-score of 2.27), suggest periods of significant physiological activation. While this could be due to intense physical activity, it could also reflect heightened sympathetic nervous system activity associated with stress, especially when considered alongside the subjective distress markers.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The data present a clear dichotomy: strong objective physiological resilience (robust circadian rhythm, consistent sleep, low trait anxiety, high physical activity) juxtaposed with significant self-reported subjective distress (disturbed sleep, elevated depressive symptoms). Given that the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) specifically measures *perceived* stress, self-report measures of distress hold considerable weight. The very high PSQI score (Z-score 1.98) indicating ""Disturbed Sleep"" is a particularly salient piece of evidence, as the subjective experience of poor sleep is a direct and potent stressor. While the participant's physiological system demonstrates stability and robustness, the *perception* of sleep difficulties and the presence of depressive symptoms are strong indicators that their overall perceived stress level is likely elevated compared to the general student population. The magnitude of the PSQI Z-score, combined with the positive correlation of CESD with PSS, suggests that the subjective experience of distress outweighs the protective factors in determining their overall perceived stress. Therefore, it is most likely that the participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

93002,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data reveal a complex profile characterized by significant sleep disturbance alongside generally well-regulated physiological rhythms, though with notable departures in self-perceived well-being.

Sleep quality and duration emerge as a primary concern. The participant reported a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" with a Z-score of 1.05, indicating substantially poorer subjective sleep quality compared to the study population. This is corroborated by wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 28 minutes, which is below average for the population (Z-score -0.88), and elevated napping behavior (Z-score 1.21), likely as a compensatory mechanism for insufficient nocturnal sleep. Furthermore, both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit moderate variability (Z-scores of 0.43 for both standard deviations), suggesting an inconsistent sleep schedule. These sleep patterns, particularly disturbed sleep and higher napping frequency, correlate positively with higher perceived stress.

Regarding self-reported psychological states, the participant indicated lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.87), lower current happiness (Z-score -0.53), and reduced satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.78). These self-perceptions correlate negatively with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, suggesting that lower self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction are associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, measures of depressive symptoms (CESD score 14.0, Z-score 0.07) are within the typical range, and trait anxiety (STAI score 40.0, Z-score -0.13) is slightly below the study population average, indicating that the participant does not exhibit elevated chronic anxiety or depressive symptom burden relative to their peers. Substance use across categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is notably low, with Z-scores ranging from -0.11 to -1.3, indicating healthier habits in this domain. Daily recreational habits suggest a lack of engagement in activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, reading, and sedentary hobbies, with higher internet usage (Z-score 0.85), which correlates positively with perceived stress.

From a physiological perspective, the participant exhibits several markers suggestive of good cardiovascular fitness and robust circadian rhythmicity. The resting heart rate (48.25 bpm) and mesor (64.89 bpm) are both significantly low (Z-scores of -1.18 and -1.24, respectively), which are generally indicative of strong cardiovascular health. These lower values for resting heart rate and mesor correlate positively with PSS, meaning lower values are associated with lower PSS. The circadian rhythm derived from heart rate data demonstrates above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.81), reflecting a relatively stable and consistent daily physiological rhythm. These measures of circadian regularity correlate negatively with PSS, suggesting that a more stable rhythm is associated with lower perceived stress. However, intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z-score 0.24), which correlates positively with PSS. Aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal pronounced deviations from the mesor, with significant peaks in physiological arousal observed during midday (12-1 PM, Z-score 1.61) and especially in the early evening (7-8 PM, Z-score 2.16). While these peaks indicate periods of high cardiovascular activity, the correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are predominantly negative, implying that these active periods may not be perceived as inherently stressful and could potentially be associated with lower overall stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

Based on a holistic analysis of the available evidence, the participant's overall perceived stress level is likely to place them in the **top half** of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile) is primarily driven by significant self-reported distress related to sleep and general well-being. The most salient indicator is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0, which is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and carries a substantial Z-score of 1.05. This clinically significant sleep disturbance, coupled with objectively shorter and more variable sleep durations and elevated napping, strongly suggests an elevated perceived stress load. Furthermore, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.87), lower happiness (Z-score -0.53), and reduced health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78). The negative correlations of these metrics with PSS indicate that these lower levels of well-being are associated with higher perceived stress. Higher internet usage and less engagement in reading also correlate positively with PSS, contributing to the picture of elevated perceived stress.

Conversely, evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) includes below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.13) and normal depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 0.07), suggesting that chronic anxiety or depression are not primary drivers of stress relative to their peers. Physiologically, the participant exhibits robust indicators of cardiovascular fitness (exceptionally low resting heart rate and mesor Z-scores) and highly stable circadian rhythms (above-average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation). These physiological strengths are generally protective against stress, and their correlations with PSS suggest they are associated with lower perceived stress. Additionally, the analysis of hourly heart rate deviations reveals that periods of high physiological arousal are largely associated with lower perceived stress, implying these activities are not perceived as stressful.

Despite the notable physiological resilience and lower trait anxiety, the direct impact of significantly disturbed sleep and diminished self-reported well-being (self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) is likely to contribute more directly and substantially to the participant's *perceived* stress. The cluster of negative self-reported indicators, particularly sleep quality, provides a more compelling argument for an elevated PSS score, outweighing the physiological markers that suggest resilience but do not directly reflect subjective experience of stress.

56543,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile indicates a notable propensity for distress. Self-report measures reveal elevated depressive symptoms (CESD score 18.0, Z-score 0.49), classifying them as 'depressed', a factor positively correlated with perceived stress (0.28). Trait anxiety is also notably high (STAI score 50.0, Z-score 0.86), classified as 'anxious', showing a stronger positive correlation with perceived stress (0.31). Supporting these, self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.73), and self-reported happiness is lower than typical (Z-score -0.53), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress, indicating that lower scores on these measures are associated with higher stress. These combined psychological markers suggest a vulnerability to internalizing distress and a lower overall affective well-being. Despite this, reported satisfaction with physical health is above average (Z-score 0.88), though its correlation with perceived stress is weak and negative.

Sleep patterns represent a significant area of concern for this participant. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is supported by objective wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours 26 minutes, which is substantially shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.94). The median sleep start time is very late at 02:22:30 AM. While the standard deviation for both sleep duration and start time is lower than average (Z-scores -0.67 and -0.50 respectively), this could reflect a *consistently* irregular or insufficient sleep schedule rather than healthy regularity. Mean daily napping is slightly above average (Z-score 0.31) and positively correlated with perceived stress, which might suggest attempts to compensate for inadequate nocturnal sleep. Overall, the significant sleep disturbances are consistent with a heightened state of stress.

Behavioral habits present a mixed picture of potential stress coping and contributing factors. The participant demonstrates abstinence from all reported substance use categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs), suggesting a healthier coping mechanism in this domain. In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in solitary exercise more frequently than average (Z-score 1.07), with less participation in social exercise or sports. The increased solitary exercise shows a weak positive correlation with perceived stress, which could indicate its role as a compensatory coping mechanism or simply part of a demanding routine. Recreational activities show two particularly salient patterns: extremely high internet usage (more than 4 hours daily, Z-score 2.19) is positively correlated with perceived stress (0.10), suggesting it may contribute to or be a response to stress. Conversely, there is an exceptionally high engagement in reading (2-3 hours daily, Z-score 4.24), which demonstrates a strong negative correlation with perceived stress (-0.23), indicating that reading serves as a significant and effective stress-reducing activity for this individual.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal prominent indicators of elevated arousal and provide insights into the participant's circadian rhythms. Both the average heart rate (Mesor = 82.27 bpm, Z-score 1.14) and the Resting Heart Rate (RHR = 68.0 bpm, Z-score 1.17) are significantly higher than the population average, and both are positively correlated with perceived stress. These elevated metrics strongly suggest a state of chronic physiological arousal or sympathetic nervous system activation. Circadian rhythmicity metrics show above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.32), with the latter positively correlating with perceived stress. Lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.36) suggests less predictable daily heart rate patterns. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals periods of intense physiological activity. Notably, extremely high heart rate deviations are observed late at night (e.g., 9-10 PM with Z-score 3.28, 10-11 PM with Z-score 5.94). Interestingly, these specific late-night increases exhibit a negative correlation with perceived stress, suggesting that for this individual, heightened physiological activity during these hours is associated with *lower* perceived stress, potentially reflecting engagement in non-stressful activities or productive tasks rather than distress. Conversely, heart rate during typical early morning sleep hours (2-7 AM), while below the Mesor, shows positive correlations with perceived stress, suggesting that less physiological recovery or higher arousal during these sleep periods is linked to elevated stress.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

The participant exhibits multiple robust indicators associated with elevated perceived stress. Psychologically, both depressive symptoms (CESD, Z-score 0.49) and trait anxiety (STAI, Z-score 0.86) are notably elevated and positively correlated with PSS, suggesting a predisposition to experience higher stress. Lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and happiness (Z-score -0.53), which negatively correlate with PSS, further support higher stress levels. Objectively, sleep quality is significantly disturbed (PSQI, Z-score 1.05), with notably short median sleep duration (Z-score -0.94), factors commonly linked to increased stress. Physiologically, the participant displays chronic heightened arousal, as evidenced by significantly elevated Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 1.17) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor, Z-score 1.14), both of which are positively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, high internet usage (Z-score 2.19) is positively associated with PSS. The pattern of less heart rate suppression during early morning sleep, showing positive correlations with PSS, also points towards impaired recovery from stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

Several factors might mitigate the participant's perceived stress. The most prominent protective factor is an exceptionally high engagement in reading (Z-score 4.24), which demonstrates a strong negative correlation with PSS (-0.23). This suggests reading is a highly effective coping mechanism for this individual. The participant also completely abstains from substance use. While there are physiological signs of activity late at night (e.g., extremely high hourly heart rate deviations between 9-11 PM), these specific peaks are negatively correlated with PSS. This counter-intuitive finding suggests that for this participant, late-night activity, despite its intensity, is associated with *lower* perceived stress, perhaps indicating productive academic work or enjoyable leisure rather than distress. Higher interdaily heart rate stability (Z-score 0.67) is also weakly negatively correlated with PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant demonstrates a powerful stress-buffering behavior in their extensive reading habits and shows some physiological activity patterns that are paradoxically associated with lower stress, the overall evidence strongly points towards a higher perceived stress level. The combination of significantly elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, clinically significant sleep disturbance, and persistent physiological hyper-arousal (high RHR and Mesor, both positively correlated with PSS) represents a pervasive and fundamental state of distress that outweighs the identified protective factors. The consistent self-reported psychological vulnerabilities and objective physiological markers of arousal are compelling indicators that this individual experiences perceived stress at a level higher than the average study population.

89142,0.0,0.0051813471502590676,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile indicates a vulnerability to perceived stress, characterized by above-average trait anxiety (STAI score 48.0, Z=0.66), which is classified as ""anxious"" and positively correlated with PSS (0.34). This is further supported by below-average self-esteem (Score 32.0, Z=-0.87) and lower self-reported happiness (Current 3.0, Z=-0.53). A particularly salient finding is the participant's significantly low satisfaction with their physical health (Score 1.0, Z=-2.45), indicating a substantial area of perceived distress, even if the direct correlation with PSS is weak. While depressive symptoms are within the average range (CESD score 12.0, Z=-0.14, ""Not depressed""), academic performance has shown a declining trend over recent semesters (GPA from 3.73 to 3.33), which could serve as an additional source of stress within an academic context.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a notably sedentary lifestyle. They report not engaging in exercise either alone (Z=-1.93) or with others (Z=-1.58), nor participating in sports (Z=-1.09), placing their activity levels significantly below the population average. In contrast, they engage in significantly more video gaming (Z=1.71) and reading (Z=2.28) than their peers, suggesting a preference for solitary and less physically active leisure pursuits. Substance use is consistently reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, indicating very low engagement in alcohol or drug consumption, which suggests an absence of these potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms.

Sleep patterns reveal a critical objective discrepancy. Despite reporting subjectively ""Good Sleep"" as measured by the PSQI (Score 4.0, Z=-1.26), wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of only 5 hours 50 minutes (Z=-1.68), which is significantly shorter than the study population average. This suggests that the participant may not fully perceive the impact of chronic sleep deprivation. Sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability are both within the average range. Furthermore, the participant reports slightly above-average napping (Z=0.7), which may serve as a partial, but likely insufficient, compensatory mechanism for the short nightly sleep.

From a physiological perspective, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a significantly low mean heart rate (Mesor 60.11, Z=-1.89) and resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z=-1.49). Circadian rhythmicity appears generally robust, with average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation. Intradaily variability is slightly below average (Z=-0.74), suggesting relatively consistent physiological patterns throughout the day. The acrophase, or time of peak heart rate, occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:57 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear diurnal pattern of physiological arousal: heart rate is significantly elevated above baseline during typical waking hours, with pronounced increases observed in the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z=1.81; 9-10 AM, Z=1.69), sustained activity through the afternoon and early evening, and appropriate reductions during the night. This indicates a well-regulated physiological response to the daily light-dark cycle and activity.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

To assess whether the participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS, falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution (where the population median PSS score is 22.0), we consider the cumulative evidence.

Evidence supporting a high PSS score (top 50th percentile, >22.0) is substantial. The participant reports above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.66), a factor strongly and positively correlated with perceived stress. Crucially, their self-reported satisfaction with physical health is exceptionally low (Health Satisfaction Z=-2.45), indicating a profound dissatisfaction in a fundamental domain of well-being that is likely a significant stressor. Objectively, the participant experiences very short median sleep duration (5 hours 50 minutes, Z=-1.68), which represents a chronic physiological stressor known to negatively impact mood, cognitive function, and stress perception, even if subjectively reported as good sleep. Additionally, below-average self-esteem (Z=-0.87) and happiness (Z=-0.53), coupled with a declining GPA, further suggest an elevated vulnerability to and experience of stress.

Conversely, some factors might point towards a lower or average PSS score (bottom 50th percentile, <=22.0). The participant exhibits excellent cardiovascular fitness, as evidenced by a significantly low resting heart rate (Z=-1.49) and mesor (Z=-1.89), which are generally indicators of good physical health and potentially greater resilience to stress. They also report very low substance usage across all categories, avoiding common maladaptive coping strategies. Subjectively, their sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z=-1.26), which could buffer the perceived impact of their objectively short sleep. Furthermore, engagement in reading is significantly higher than average (Z=2.28), which can be a relaxing and stress-reducing activity.

Holistically, while the participant demonstrates strong physiological health markers and avoids substance use, the confluence of elevated trait anxiety, extremely low health satisfaction, and chronic, objectively short sleep duration are powerful indicators of heightened perceived stress. The magnitude of the deviations for health satisfaction and sleep duration, despite some weak correlations, points to significant and likely unaddressed stressors. The participant's self-perception of ""good sleep"" despite critically short duration suggests a potential lack of awareness or normalization of a significant physiological stressor. When weighed against the protective factors, the evidence for elevated psychological and behavioral risk factors for stress is more compelling. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall perceived stress level places them in the top half of the study population.

24898,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex psychological profile characterized by both vulnerabilities and strengths. Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score 45.0, Z-score 0.37) is slightly elevated, categorizing the participant as ""anxious,"" a psychological state positively correlated with perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 31.0, Z-score -1.01) is notably below the study population average, which is negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting a significant area of vulnerability that could contribute to higher perceived stress. In contrast, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.88), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS, indicating positive aspects of overall well-being. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D (score 14.0, Z-score 0.07), are within the ""not depressed"" classification and are average for the population. Trust in others is significantly below average (Z-score -1.1), though its correlation with PSS is weak.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active and engaged lifestyle. Exercise frequency is consistently high across all reported categories (""Exercised Alone,"" ""Exercised with Others,"" and ""Sports""), with Z-scores well above population averages (1.07 to 1.58). Substance use is minimal, with alcohol consumption reported as ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" and no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits further indicate a preference for engaging and active pursuits, including extensive listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and reading (Z-score 2.28), as well as substantial time socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95). Notably, engagement in reading is strongly negatively correlated with PSS, suggesting it may serve as a significant stress-buffering activity. Conversely, engagement in ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and ""Internet Usage"" for recreation is significantly below average, indicating reduced sedentary screen time.

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture when considering subjective experience versus objective consistency. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating subjective difficulties. However, relative to the study population, the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates a slightly *better* subjective sleep quality than the average participant for this measure. Wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, which is significantly below the population average (Z-score -1.18), an objective factor that could impact well-being. Despite this shorter duration, the participant exhibits remarkable consistency in sleep habits; both the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score -0.88) and sleep start time (Z-score -1.07) are well below average, indicating highly regular sleep-wake patterns. The consistency in sleep parameters, particularly the low variability in sleep duration and start time, is associated with lower PSS, while shorter overall duration has a weak negative correlation. The absence of naps (Z-score -0.86) further contributes to this consistent nocturnal sleep structure.

The participant's physiological data derived from wearables points to a highly regulated and robust circadian rhythm, indicative of strong biological organization. The Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.99) and Amplitude (Z-score 1.64) of heart rate are very high, while Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.45) is very low. These metrics collectively signify a remarkably stable and pronounced 24-hour heart rate rhythm with clear periods of activity and rest, factors generally associated with lower physiological stress. The Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 0.81) further supports this strong daily rhythmicity. The participant also exhibits a significantly low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z-score -1.04), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness and a parasympathetically dominant state at rest. This low resting heart rate correlates positively with PSS, implying it is associated with lower perceived stress in this population. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a distinct daily profile: heart rate is significantly suppressed during early morning hours (e.g., -31.54 bpm at 4-5 AM, Z-score -2.22), consistent with deep rest, and shows pronounced peaks of arousal during the late morning (e.g., 9.86 bpm at 7-8 AM, Z-score 2.41) and especially the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 21.24 bpm at 2-3 PM, Z-score 2.62; 24.94 bpm at 6-7 PM, Z-score 2.15). The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, is at 4:05 PM. This robust and energetic daily physiological rhythm, coupled with excellent circadian features, suggests effective physiological coping mechanisms.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence supporting a perceived stress level that would place the participant in the bottom half of the study population distribution, despite some areas of psychological vulnerability.

Evidence for a lower or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile) is robust. The participant exhibits excellent physiological regulation, characterized by very high interdaily stability (Z=1.99), low intradaily variability (Z=-1.45), strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=0.81), and high amplitude (Z=1.64) in their heart rate circadian rhythm. These features indicate a highly organized and consistent daily physiological pattern, which is generally protective against stress. A significantly low resting heart rate (Z=-1.04) further suggests superior cardiovascular fitness and efficient autonomic regulation, a factor positively correlated with PSS, thus pointing towards lower stress. Behaviorally, the participant engages in high levels of physical exercise (all Z-scores > 1.0) and beneficial recreational activities such as reading (Z=2.28, negatively correlated with PSS) and socializing (Z=0.95), which are typically associated with stress reduction. Self-reported happiness (Z=0.55) and health satisfaction (Z=0.88) are above average and negatively correlated with PSS. Furthermore, while the PSQI raw score suggests ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates *better* subjective sleep quality than the population average for this measure. Objectively, wearable sleep data shows remarkable consistency in sleep duration (Z=-0.88 for standard deviation) and sleep start time (Z=-1.07 for standard deviation), both of which are associated with lower PSS, despite the objectively shorter median sleep duration.

Evidence for a higher PSS score (top 50th percentile) includes significantly lower self-esteem (Z=-1.01, negatively correlated with PSS, meaning lower self-esteem associated with higher PSS) and slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.37, positively correlated with PSS). Additionally, the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes is notably short (Z=-1.18). While a short sleep duration is a potential stressor, its correlation with PSS in this dataset is very weak (-0.04), and the high consistency of the participant's sleep parameters appears to mitigate some of the negative impact of the absolute duration.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the participant's strong physiological resilience, highly active and engaged lifestyle, and consistent sleep patterns, along with above-average happiness and health satisfaction, likely buffer the impact of lower self-esteem and elevated trait anxiety. The numerous and strong indicators pointing towards lower stress outweigh the more limited set of factors that might elevate PSS. Therefore, the participant is most likely to have a PSS score in the bottom half of the distribution.

74413,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by notably low self-reported psychological distress and effective engagement in protective behavioral strategies, alongside some physiological indicators suggesting internal strain or fragmented daily physiological regulation.

Psychologically, the participant demonstrates a robust profile of well-being. Scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) (6.0, Z-score: -0.76) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (31.0, Z-score: -1.02) are both significantly below the study population average, indicating lower-than-average depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness. This is further supported by a higher-than-average self-esteem score (46.0, Z-score: 1.1). Consistent with these findings, the participant maintains a high academic performance, evidenced by a 2016 Fall GPA of 3.7. However, this positive psychological landscape is nuanced by lower-than-average self-reported happiness (3.0, Z-score: -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (2.67, Z-score: -1.2), which suggest areas of subjective dissatisfaction despite broader psychological strengths.

Behaviorally, the participant adheres to several habits generally considered beneficial for stress management. There is no reported use of alcohol (beer, wine, liquor) or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low Z-scores, suggesting an absence of maladaptive coping mechanisms involving substance use. Exercise habits are robust, with frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07). The participant also engages in reading more than the average population (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score: 1.3), an activity negatively correlated with perceived stress. Conversely, engagement in passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage is notably low, with Z-scores well below average, particularly for internet usage (Z-score: -2.5, indicating ""Do not do"").

Regarding sleep, the participant exhibits a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes, which is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.47). Objectively, sleep duration consistency is remarkably high, as indicated by a very low standard deviation (42 minutes, Z-score: -1.34). However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" though the Z-score (-0.33) suggests this subjective disturbance is slightly less severe than the average for the study population. The median sleep start time is 00:31:59, with average variability.

Physiological data reveal an interesting pattern of daily heart rate regulation. The participant's resting heart rate is lower than average (55.4 bpm, Z-score: -0.33), typically indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics show an average MESOR and amplitude. However, there is significantly higher intradaily variability (0.76, Z-score: 1.51), suggesting more fragmentation or instability in heart rate patterns throughout the day, a metric positively correlated with perceived stress. Interdaily stability (0.36, Z-score: -0.41) is slightly below average, indicating less day-to-day regularity in heart rate rhythms. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals pronounced peaks, notably during the late evening hours. Specifically, the deviation between 10-11 PM (22.05) exhibits a particularly high Z-score (2.46), suggesting significant physiological arousal during a period typically associated with winding down for sleep. This elevated late-night activity could indicate a demanding schedule or difficulty with physiological relaxation, despite the specific correlation for this hour being negative with PSS.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits strong and consistent evidence for a relatively low or average perceived stress level. The most compelling indicators come from self-reported psychological measures: significantly lower-than-average scores on the CESD (Z-score: -0.76) and STAI (Z-score: -1.02) suggest minimal depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness, both of which correlate positively with PSS (meaning lower scores on these scales predict lower PSS). High self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1) is also a protective factor, negatively correlated with PSS. Behaviorally, the participant engages in frequent solitary exercise and above-average reading, with reading being strongly negatively correlated with PSS (correlation: -0.21). The complete absence of substance use further indicates a lack of maladaptive coping. Objectively, the participant achieves a healthy sleep duration with very high consistency (low standard deviation for sleep duration, Z-score: -1.34), which generally contributes to well-being. Their resting heart rate is also lower than average (Z-score: -0.33), typically a sign of good cardiovascular health.

**Evidence for High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several factors suggest potential areas of elevated perceived stress. The most prominent physiological indicator is the significantly higher-than-average intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score: 1.51), which shows a positive correlation with PSS (correlation: 0.17). This points to less stable or more fragmented daily physiological regulation, a pattern often associated with stress. Slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.41) also contributes to this picture of less rhythmic physiological patterns. Subjectively, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and significantly lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: -1.2), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (meaning lower satisfaction/happiness predict higher PSS). Additionally, while the PSQI Z-score is slightly below average, the classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 6.0) indicates subjective sleep quality concerns. Finally, pronounced physiological arousal late in the evening (e.g., 10-11 PM heart rate deviation, Z-score: 2.46) could indicate difficulty unwinding, although its direct correlation with PSS for this specific hour is negative.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are notable physiological signs of internal strain (high intradaily variability) and subjective dissatisfaction (lower happiness and health satisfaction), the overall weight of evidence strongly points towards the participant likely experiencing lower-than-average perceived stress. The robust psychological protective factors—specifically, very low self-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness, coupled with high self-esteem and engagement in positive coping behaviors like frequent reading and exercise—are direct and powerful indicators of lower perceived psychological burden. These self-reported measures directly address subjective psychological state, which is central to the concept of perceived stress. The high intradaily variability, while significant, might reflect an active lifestyle or individual physiological differences rather than *perceived* distress, especially when core psychological well-being is high. Therefore, despite some physiological challenges and subjective discontent, the participant's psychological resilience and adaptive coping strategies suggest they manage daily demands without reporting high levels of overall perceived stress.

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and physiological profile, with several indicators suggesting an elevated level of perceived stress. Psychologically, self-report data reveal significant distress, including a CESD score of 20.0 (Z-score 0.7), classifying the participant as 'Depressed', and a STAI score of 43.0 (Z-score 0.17), classifying them as 'anxious'. Both these scores are above the population average and show moderate positive correlations with perceived stress. Concurrently, the participant reports notably low satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -0.86), a factor that can contribute to overall distress. While self-esteem is slightly below average and happiness is slightly above average, the prominent depressive and anxious symptomatology points towards an individual prone to experiencing higher stress. Academic performance remains consistently high, with GPAs of 4.0, 3.86, and 4.0, which may indicate a strong academic drive that could potentially be a source of pressure, even if not directly measured as stress.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits patterns that may both exacerbate and mitigate stress. Engagement in physical activity is notably low across all categories, including exercising alone (Z-score -0.43), exercising with others (Z-score -1.58), and sports (Z-score -1.09). Reduced physical activity, especially social activity, often correlates with higher stress. Similarly, time spent on many common recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, internet usage, and listening to music is below average. Socializing with friends is also reported as below average (Z-score -0.62). In contrast, the participant dedicates an above-average amount of time to reading (Z-score 1.3), an activity that shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS, suggesting it may serve as a beneficial coping mechanism or preferred leisure activity. Substance use is generally low, indicating it is not a primary factor in stress management for this individual.

Sleep patterns are a significant area of concern, strongly indicating a contribution to increased stress. The participant's median sleep duration is short at 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score -0.8), falling below the population average. More critically, their sleep duration exhibits exceptionally high variability (standard deviation of 166 minutes, Z-score 1.49), which points to inconsistent sleep schedules. Such irregularity can severely disrupt physiological processes and heighten perceived stress. Although the PSQI score of 6.0 classifies subjective sleep quality as 'Disturbed Sleep', its Z-score of -0.33 suggests it is slightly better than the average for disturbed sleepers in the study population. The participant also maintains a late median sleep start time of 01:19:14, though with average variability in this timing.

Physiologically, wearable data reveals several markers consistent with elevated arousal and chronic stress. The participant's resting heart rate (68.7 bpm, Z-score 1.25) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 83.16 bpm, Z-score 1.26) are significantly higher than the population averages, indicating persistent sympathetic nervous system activation. Furthermore, the amplitude of their heart rate circadian rhythm is notably blunted (Z-score -0.99), suggesting a reduced physiological range of response to daily cycles, which can be an indicator of chronic stress or dysregulation. While the participant exhibits a higher interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) and slightly lower intradaily variability (Z-score -0.39) in their heart rate rhythm, generally positive indicators of rhythm consistency, these do not counteract the overall elevated heart rate measures. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a particularly pronounced surge in cardiovascular activity during the 8-9 AM period (Z-score 1.71), reflecting a sharp and exaggerated physiological response possibly linked to morning stressors or the start of the day. Conversely, certain afternoon and evening hours show heart rate deviations lower than the population average (e.g., 6-7 PM, Z-score -1.53), which may suggest periods of relative hypoarousal or reduced physical activity compared to peers.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The evidence strongly suggests the participant's perceived stress level (PSS score) falls into the top 50th percentile of the study population. Self-report measures are highly indicative, with the participant classified as 'Depressed' (CESD Z-score 0.7) and 'anxious' (STAI Z-score 0.17), both of which show moderate positive correlations with PSS. Their low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.86) also aligns with a higher stress burden. Objectively, sleep patterns are a significant contributor to elevated stress; the participant exhibits a short median sleep duration (Z-score -0.8) and, critically, an exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.49). Irregular and insufficient sleep are well-established precursors and consequences of heightened stress. Physiologically, the data reveals significant and consistent markers of chronic arousal, including a substantially elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.25) and a higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.26). The blunted amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm (Z-score -0.99) further suggests physiological dysregulation often associated with chronic stress. The exaggerated heart rate surge during the 8-9 AM period (Z-score 1.71) points to a heightened physiological response during a key daily activation window. The combination of these robust self-reported psychological symptoms, objective sleep disturbances, and consistent physiological indicators of sympathetic activation provides compelling evidence for elevated perceived stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
A few factors might suggest a lower or average perceived stress level, though these are largely outweighed by the aforementioned evidence. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and trust (Z-score 0.83); however, the correlations of these self-reported emotions with PSS are weak and negative (-0.19 and -0.04 respectively), indicating a limited impact on overall perceived stress. Similarly, high academic achievement (consistent high GPAs) might be seen as a stress buffer, but can also represent a source of pressure. While the participant's subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.33) is slightly better than the average for disturbed sleepers, this nuanced detail does not negate the significant issues with sleep duration and its extreme variability. Furthermore, their heart rate circadian rhythm shows higher interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) and lower intradaily variability (Z-score -0.39), which are typically positive indicators of rhythm regularity; however, these are observed against a backdrop of overall elevated heart rates and blunted amplitude, suggesting underlying strain despite structural regularity. Lastly, above-average reading time (Z-score 1.3) with a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21) could serve as a mild stress-reducing activity.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Upon a holistic analysis, the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant experiences a relatively high level of perceived stress. The strong positive correlations of depressive and anxious symptoms with PSS, coupled with significant physiological markers of chronic arousal (elevated resting and mean heart rate, blunted heart rate amplitude, and a pronounced morning HR surge), are powerful indicators. The extremely high variability in sleep duration and the overall short sleep duration further corroborate a state of elevated stress. While some self-reported positive aspects (happiness, trust, reading) and circadian rhythm stability exist, their impact is insufficient to counter the robust and consistent pattern of psychological and physiological distress. Therefore, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is likely to be found in the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents with a predominantly positive psychological profile, characterized by notably low levels of self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. The CESD score of 2.0 (Z-score: -1.18) indicates an absence of depressive symptomatology, while the STAI score of 28.0 (Z-score: -1.31) classifies the individual as not anxious, both falling significantly below the study population's average. This is further supported by substantially elevated self-esteem (Score: 46.0, Z-score: 1.1) and a high level of current happiness (Score: 5.0, Z-score: 1.64), both considerably exceeding the population mean. Additionally, health satisfaction (Score: 5.0, Z-score: 0.55) and trust in others (Score: 3.67, Z-score: 0.83) are reported above average. Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with a GPA ranging from 3.93 to 4.0. These convergent psychological indicators suggest a resilient individual with a strong sense of well-being and competence, which typically aligns with lower levels of perceived stress.

Despite these psychological strengths, the participant's sleep patterns reveal significant areas of concern. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (Score: 6.0), indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" although the associated Z-score (-0.33) suggests this level of disturbance is slightly less severe than the average for the study population. However, wearable data provides a more pronounced picture of sleep insufficiency; the median sleep duration is significantly short at 5 hours 57 minutes (Z-score: -1.53). Furthermore, the median sleep start time of 02:34:14 indicates a markedly delayed sleep onset. While the consistency of sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 68 minutes, Z-score: -0.76) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 40 minutes, Z-score: -0.95) are both slightly above average (indicating relative regularity once sleep commences), the overall pattern points to chronically short and delayed sleep, which can serve as a significant physiological stressor.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a complex interplay between baseline cardiovascular health and acute arousal. The participant exhibits a remarkably low Mesor (65.04, Z-score: -1.22) and Resting Heart Rate (47.35, Z-score: -1.28), both significantly below the population average. These values are typically indicative of good cardiovascular fitness and a generally low physiological stress response at rest. However, analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates distinct periods of pronounced physiological activity. Most notably, the period between 1-2 AM shows an exceptionally high positive deviation (14.11, Z-score: 3.1), suggesting substantial physiological arousal or activity during a time when heart rate is typically at its lowest during deep sleep. Other late-night and evening hours (e.g., 12-1 AM, 8-9 PM) also exhibit elevated heart rate deviations, albeit to a lesser extent. The acrophase, or the peak in heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 6:01 PM. Circadian rhythm metrics such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -0.57) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: -0.78) are somewhat below average, suggesting a less robust or regular daily heart rate rhythm, while Intradaily Variability (Z-score: 0.60) is slightly above average. Collectively, these physiological patterns suggest a healthy baseline cardiovascular system that experiences significant, potentially disruptive, nocturnal arousal.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant demonstrates a mix of habits. Alcohol consumption (beer usage at 1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01) is above average, but usage of other substances is moderate or non-existent. The participant reports high levels of physical activity, exercising alone ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score: 1.07) and with others ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score: 0.53), both above population averages. Conversely, engagement in many sedentary or social recreational activities is below average. Time spent watching TV/videos (Z-score: -0.62), playing video games (Z-score: -0.56), and socializing with friends (Z-score: -0.62) is notably low. The participant reports ""do not do"" for reading (Z-score: -0.67) and sedentary hobbies (Z-score: -0.96). While frequent exercise is a known buffer against stress, the limited engagement in other common leisure and social activities, particularly the absence of reading which shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS, could signify a less diversified set of coping or restorative behaviors.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The overwhelming majority of self-reported psychological well-being measures strongly indicate a lower-than-average level of perceived stress for this participant. Depressive symptoms (CESD score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.18, correlation with PSS: 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI score: 28.0, Z-score: -1.31, correlation with PSS: 0.31) are both significantly low and positively correlated with PSS, directly suggesting lower perceived stress. Furthermore, a notably high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1, correlation with PSS: -0.15) and significantly high happiness (Z-score: 1.64, correlation with PSS: -0.19) are robust indicators that are negatively correlated with PSS, providing strong evidence for reduced perceived stress. Other positive indicators, such as above-average health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.55, correlation with PSS: -0.07) and trust (Z-score: 0.83, correlation with PSS: -0.04), also weakly support a lower PSS. Physiologically, a significantly low Mesor (Z-score: -1.22, correlation with PSS: 0.06) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score: -1.28, correlation with PSS: 0.13) generally reflect good cardiovascular health, which would typically be associated with lower chronic stress. Even the PSQI Z-score (-0.33) indicates sleep disturbance that is less pronounced than the study population average.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the strong psychological indicators of low stress, several physiological and behavioral factors suggest underlying challenges that could contribute to higher perceived stress. The most salient is the exceptionally high heart rate deviation from the mesor observed between 1-2 AM (Z-score: 3.1), indicating profound physiological arousal during a typical sleep period. While its direct correlation with PSS is weak (0.06), the sheer magnitude of this physiological disruption is a significant marker of acute stress or disturbance. Objectively, the participant experiences significantly short sleep duration (5 hours 57 minutes, Z-score: -1.53), a known stressor, though its correlation with PSS is weakly negative (-0.05). Circadian rhythm metrics, including below-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score: -0.57, correlation with PSS: -0.12) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score: -0.78, correlation with PSS: -0.17), suggest less regular daily rhythms which could contribute to physiological strain. Conversely, above-average Intradaily Variability (Z-score: 0.60, correlation with PSS: 0.16) indicates greater short-term HR fluctuation, positively correlating with PSS. From a behavioral perspective, the participant's reported lack of engagement in reading (""Do not do"", Z-score: -0.67) shows a moderate negative correlation with PSS (-0.21), implying that this absence is associated with higher perceived stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
A comprehensive assessment reveals a compelling dichotomy in this participant's data. On one hand, the participant reports exceptionally strong psychological well-being, characterized by very low symptoms of depression and anxiety, and high levels of self-esteem and happiness. These self-reported psychological states are directly and robustly negatively correlated with perceived stress, forming a powerful argument for a lower PSS score. The participant's academic success further points to effective functioning and potentially robust coping mechanisms. On the other hand, objective physiological data and sleep metrics indicate significant underlying disruptions, particularly the chronically short and late sleep schedule, and the dramatic nocturnal heart rate elevation. While these objective stressors are substantial, their direct correlations with PSS are often weak, or in some cases, counter-intuitive when interpreted in isolation. When evaluating *perceived* stress, the participant's own subjective experience, as captured by the self-report measures of psychological well-being, is paramount. The strength and consistency of these positive self-reported indicators suggest that, despite physiological challenges, the individual likely possesses strong internal resources or coping strategies that buffer against these stressors, leading to a lower overall perception of stress. Therefore, the robust psychological indicators of well-being, which directly align with lower perceived stress, are given greater weight in determining the participant's overall PSS ranking.

**Conclusion:** Based on the preponderance of evidence from self-reported psychological measures strongly correlated with perceived stress, the participant is more likely to fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution for PSS.

19245,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"The participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress alongside some indicators of physical resilience and engagement in various activities. Self-report data reveals notably elevated depressive symptoms, with a CESD score of 26.0 (Z-score 1.32), classifying the individual as experiencing depressive symptoms above the population mean. Similarly, trait anxiety is considerably high, indicated by a STAI score of 55.0 (Z-score 1.35), placing them in the 'anxious' category relative to the study population. These psychological markers are positively correlated with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores (0.28 and 0.31 respectively), suggesting a direct link to higher stress. Further supporting this, self-reported happiness is significantly below average (Z-score -1.61), and health satisfaction is also lower than the mean (Z-score -0.78). Self-esteem is slightly below average, although its correlation with PSS is weak. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, which, while indicative of high achievement, could also be a source of pressure.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in above-average substance use, including beer (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01) and recreational drugs (less than 1-2 times a month, Z-score 1.61). These behaviors could potentially serve as coping mechanisms, though their correlations with PSS are negligible in this dataset. Exercise habits are robust, with the participant exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07), which typically acts as a stress buffer. Leisure activities show above-average engagement in listening to music and socializing with friends, potentially offering outlets for stress reduction. However, reading, which shows a weak negative correlation with PSS, is infrequent.

Sleep patterns are a significant area of concern. Despite a high median sleep duration of over 8 hours (Z-score 1.14), the individual reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 7.0, indicating clinically significant disturbance). More critically, objective wearable data highlights substantial irregularity in sleep: both sleep duration (standard deviation of 155 minutes, Z-score 1.23) and sleep start times (median 02:38:30, standard deviation of 125 minutes, Z-score 0.92) show high variability. These high variability measures for sleep are positively correlated with PSS (0.13 and 0.17 respectively), directly linking sleep irregularity to higher perceived stress. The participant also takes significantly more naps than average (Z-score 2.27), potentially as a compensatory mechanism for irregular nighttime sleep.

Physiological data from wearables presents a mixed picture. The participant exhibits excellent cardiovascular fitness, as evidenced by a low resting heart rate of 49.6 BPM (Z-score -1.02). However, heart rate data reveals significant physiological arousal in the late evening and early morning hours (10 PM to 1 AM), with mean aggregate deviations from mesor being notably elevated compared to the population (e.g., 20.73 at 10-11 PM, Z-score 2.25; 16.74 at 11-12 AM, Z-score 1.98). This sustained late-night arousal precedes the participant's very late and irregular sleep onset. Circadian rhythm metrics show below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82), indicating less consistency in daily physiological rhythms, which is weakly negatively correlated with PSS (-0.11). The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day (6:21 PM), aligning with a potential evening chronotype or a lifestyle dominated by late-day activity. While the correlations of specific late-night hourly heart rate deviations with PSS are weakly negative, suggesting these particular periods of arousal may not directly contribute to *perceived* stress for this individual, the overall pattern of physiological and behavioral irregularity combined with significant psychological distress points towards an elevated stress experience.

**Overall Ranking of PSS Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant’s overall perceived stress level would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50%):**

*   **Significant Psychological Distress:** The participant reports markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score 1.32, 'Depressed' classification) and trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.35, 'anxious' classification). Both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS (0.28 and 0.31 respectively), making them strong indicators of higher perceived stress. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is significantly low (Z-score -1.61), which aligns with higher stress levels.
*   **Highly Irregular and Disturbed Sleep:** Despite a high median sleep duration, the PSQI score of 7.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. More importantly, both the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score 1.23) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.92) are very high, pointing to extreme irregularity in sleep patterns. These sleep variability metrics are positively correlated with PSS (0.13 and 0.17), directly linking irregular sleep to elevated stress. The high frequency of naps (Z-score 2.27) further suggests disrupted sleep architecture or compensatory behaviors.
*   **Lack of Circadian Regularity:** The below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.82) suggests a less regular daily physiological rhythm, which can be a consequence of or contributor to perceived stress, showing a weak negative correlation with PSS.
*   **Late-Night Physiological Arousal:** The pronounced and sustained elevation of heart rate in the late evening and early morning hours (10 PM - 1 AM), with Z-scores well above 1.5, indicates significant physiological activation preceding a very late sleep onset. While the direct correlations of these specific hourly deviations with PSS are weakly negative, this general pattern of physiological irregularity and delayed wind-down is often associated with a lifestyle that contributes to higher stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50%):**

*   **Good Cardiovascular Fitness:** A very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.02) suggests excellent cardiovascular health, which is generally associated with better stress resilience.
*   **Above-Average Exercise Engagement:** The participant exercises frequently (Z-score 1.07), a known protective factor against stress.
*   **Engagement in Social and Recreational Activities:** Above-average time spent socializing and on hobbies could serve as positive coping mechanisms, although their correlations with PSS are negligible.
*   **High Academic Achievement:** Consistent high GPA might suggest effective stress management in an academic context, although no direct correlation with PSS is provided.
*   **Specific Hourly HR Deviations Negative Correlation:** The counter-intuitive negative correlation between late-night heart rate elevations and PSS score (-0.17, -0.15) suggests that for this individual, these specific periods of arousal may not be *perceived* as stressful, possibly being a habitual, non-distressing routine.

**Holistic Conclusion:**

While the participant demonstrates notable physical fitness and engagement in some potentially adaptive behaviors like exercise and socializing, the overall psychological and sleep profile strongly indicates heightened perceived stress. The significantly elevated scores in CESD and STAI, directly correlated with PSS, combined with markedly irregular and disturbed sleep patterns (high variability in duration and start time, disturbed sleep quality, high napping frequency), provide compelling evidence for an elevated internal experience of stress. The physiological data, while showing good baseline fitness, also points to a highly irregular daily rhythm with significant late-night arousal, which, even if not directly perceived as stressful during those specific hours, contributes to an overall state of physiological dysregulation. Given the strong psychological indicators and the pervasive sleep disturbances that align with higher perceived stress, the evidence heavily favors the conclusion that this participant experiences a higher level of perceived stress compared to the general student population.

83748,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notably robust psychological profile, characterized by significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.71) and reduced depressive symptomatology (CESD Z-score: -0.45) compared to the study population. These factors typically correlate positively with perceived stress, suggesting a protective effect for this individual. Further supporting this pattern are elevated levels of self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.52) and self-reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64), both of which are negatively correlated with perceived stress. Overall satisfaction with physical health is also above average (Z-score: 0.72), although its correlation with perceived stress is modest. These self-report measures collectively indicate a psychological disposition that is generally resilient and associated with lower levels of perceived stress.

Regarding sleep, the participant's self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score: 6.0) crosses the threshold commonly associated with ""disturbed sleep""; however, their PSQI Z-score (-0.33) indicates that their perceived sleep disturbance is slightly less pronounced than the average for the study population. While median sleep duration (6 hours 54 minutes) is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.35), a salient finding is the notably high regularity of sleep onset, with a significantly lower standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-score: -0.93). This consistent sleep schedule is a positive indicator for overall physiological stability. The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86), which, in this population, shows a mild positive correlation with PSS, suggesting non-napping may be related to lower stress.

The participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, engaging in exercise and sports at frequencies well above the population average across all categories (Exercised Alone Z-score: 1.07; Exercised with Others Z-score: 1.23; Sports Z-score: 1.58). This high level of physical activity is generally associated with positive mental health outcomes and can serve as a buffer against stress. Substance use, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is notably low or non-existent compared to peers. In contrast to these healthy physical habits, the participant reports spending an extremely limited amount of time socializing with friends (Z-score: -2.20), suggesting a relatively solitary social engagement pattern. Most other recreational activities are also generally low in reported time.

Physiological data from wearables reveal a lower overall basal heart rate, indicated by a Mesor of 69.43 bpm (Z-score: -0.62) and a resting heart rate of 55.3 bpm (Z-score: -0.34), both below the population mean and generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics show somewhat reduced interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.33) and significantly lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -0.87), implying less day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns than their peers. Interestingly, for this population, these less stable or less consistent patterns are weakly associated with lower perceived stress. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:35 PM.

An examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further illustrates this individual's physiological profile. During the typical overnight period, particularly between 3-6 AM, the heart rate deviations are notably low and below the population average, suggesting profound physiological rest. However, the participant exhibits distinct periods of elevated physiological arousal during the evening hours. Specifically, heart rate deviations are significantly above average from 5-7 PM (e.g., 6-7 PM Z-score: 2.67) and dramatically so during the late evening to pre-midnight hours (10-11 PM Z-score: 1.68; 11-12 AM Z-score: 3.51). These substantially elevated heart rates in the late evening, combined with the late acrophase, suggest a pattern of significant physiological activation extending into periods when many individuals are preparing for sleep. This pattern could indicate sustained engagement or a delayed wind-down phase.

## Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a low or median PSS score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological measures provide substantial evidence for a lower perceived stress level. Their trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.71) is markedly below the population average and shows a notable positive correlation with PSS, indicating lower anxiety is associated with lower stress. Similarly, depressive symptoms (CESD Z-score: -0.45) are below average, with a positive correlation to PSS. High self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.52) and elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64) are both significantly above average and negatively correlated with PSS, further supporting a lower stress profile. Behaviorally, the participant maintains a high frequency of physical exercise and sports activity, which are generally considered stress-reducing behaviors, with sports having a mild negative correlation with PSS. Physiologically, their resting heart rate and overall mesor heart rate are slightly below average, consistent with lower cardiovascular load, and demonstrate a positive correlation with PSS (lower RHR/Mesor associated with lower stress). Furthermore, their significantly more stable sleep start times (Z-score: -0.93) suggest good sleep regularity, and while sleep disturbance (PSQI) is classified as disturbed, its Z-score (-0.33) is below the population average, suggesting it is less severe than their peers.

**Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the overall favorable psychological profile, some aspects of the participant's data could potentially contribute to, or reflect, elevated stress. The self-reported PSQI score of 6.0 indicates ""disturbed sleep,"" which, irrespective of its population Z-score, suggests some personal experience of sleep difficulties. A highly salient behavioral observation is the extremely limited time spent socializing with friends (Z-score: -2.20). While the correlation with PSS is weak in this dataset, a marked reduction in social engagement can sometimes be both an indicator of, and a contributor to, psychological distress or a coping mechanism for stress. Physiologically, the consistent and significantly elevated heart rate deviations observed during late evening and pre-midnight hours (e.g., 11-12 AM Z-score: 3.51) point to sustained physiological arousal or activity during a time when others are typically transitioning to rest. Such a pattern, while not directly correlated with perceived stress in this aggregated data, could represent a physiological load that, for some individuals, is associated with higher stress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the predominant evidence strongly suggests the participant experiences relatively low levels of perceived stress. The robust psychological indicators, including exceptionally low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with high self-esteem and happiness, are powerful predictors of lower perceived stress and are consistently supported by their correlations with PSS. Their highly active lifestyle and stable sleep schedule further contribute to this assessment. While the limited social engagement and pronounced late-evening physiological arousal are noteworthy and could indicate underlying challenges or unique behavioral patterns, they do not collectively override the compelling evidence from the core psychological well-being measures that directly assess components of perceived stress. The correlations provided generally align the participant's unique patterns (e.g., lower interdaily stability, lower 24-hour autocorrelation) with lower PSS in this population. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, the participant's perceived stress level is more likely to be in the lower half of the study population distribution.

The participant's psychological profile reveals a nuanced picture, characterized by slightly elevated trait anxiety alongside average depressive symptoms. Specifically, the participant scored 45 on the STAI-Trait scale, yielding a Z-score of 0.37, which is classified as ""anxious"" and shows a positive correlation (0.31) with perceived stress. Conversely, the CES-D score of 14 (Z-score 0.07) indicates depressive symptoms within the non-depressed range, suggesting general emotional stability in this domain. Protective factors are evident in self-esteem and happiness, with scores (SelfEsteem: 40, Z-score 0.26; Happy: 4, Z-score 0.55) placing the participant above the population mean, both of which negatively correlate with perceived stress. However, health satisfaction is notably lower than average (score 3.22, Z-score -0.78), potentially indicating an area of concern that could contribute to overall stress or reflect underlying physical health perceptions. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA (3.95, 3.88), suggesting effective management of academic demands.

Sleep patterns present a significant area of concern. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7 (Z-score 0.13) classifies the participant's sleep as ""disturbed,"" indicating subjective difficulties. Objectively, Fitbit data corroborates some issues, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score -0.46), which is slightly below the population average. More critically, the standard deviation of sleep duration is 151 minutes (Z-score 1.14), reflecting considerable day-to-day variability in sleep timing, a factor positively correlated (0.14) with perceived stress. Despite this variability in duration, the standard deviation of sleep start time is close to the population average (80 minutes, Z-score -0.06), suggesting that while the *length* of sleep is inconsistent, the *initiation* of sleep might be somewhat more stable, or perhaps disrupted by inconsistent wake times leading to varying sleep durations.

Physiological data derived from heart rate monitoring reveals a robust, yet potentially elevated, autonomic profile. The Mesor, representing the participant's mean heart rate, is 82.2 BPM (Z-score 1.13), significantly higher than the population average and positively correlated (0.06) with perceived stress, indicating an overall elevated physiological arousal. Despite this high Mesor, the resting heart rate of 56.9 BPM (Z-score -0.15) is slightly below average, suggesting good cardiovascular fitness at rest. The circadian rhythm metrics indicate strong regulation, with an Amplitude of 16.02 (Z-score 1.69) being exceptionally high, signifying a pronounced fluctuation between peak and trough heart rates, which is typically a healthy indicator of robust physiological rhythm. Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.58) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98) are both above average, reflecting consistent daily patterns in heart rate. Conversely, Intradaily Variability is notably low (Z-score -1.38), suggesting less day-to-day fluctuation within the heart rate rhythm itself, which surprisingly shows a positive correlation (0.16) with PSS. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a clear diurnal pattern, with heart rate dropping significantly during early morning hours (e.g., -24.88 from Mesor at 3-4 AM) and rising throughout the day, peaking dramatically in the late evening. The deviation between 7-8 PM is particularly high (24.66 from Mesor, Z-score 2.29), indicating a period of significant physiological activity or arousal, potentially reflecting evening stressors or intense activity.

Behavioral habits largely indicate a sedentary and less socially engaged lifestyle. The participant reports ""Not at all"" for all categories of exercise (exercising alone, with others, or sports), with corresponding Z-scores ranging from -1.93 to -1.09, which are considerably below the population average. This pronounced lack of physical activity is a notable behavioral feature. Substance usage is minimal, with ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" or ""Not at all"" across all categories, placing the participant below average in substance consumption. Daily recreational habits also show reduced engagement compared to peers; for instance, ""Socializing with Friends"" is reported as ""16-30 minutes"" (Z-score -1.41), significantly less than average. Similar patterns of reduced engagement are observed in internet usage and reading. This composite behavioral profile suggests a potential lack of engagement in typical stress-buffering activities such as exercise and social interaction, which could contribute to perceived stress, despite the low use of substances.

### Overall Ranking of PSS Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median PSS Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several characteristics commonly associated with lower perceived stress. Their CES-D score is within the non-depressed range, and self-reported happiness and self-esteem are above average, with both negatively correlating with PSS. The participant's academic performance is consistently high, suggesting effective coping with scholastic demands. Behaviorally, substance use is significantly low across all categories. Physiologically, the robust circadian rhythm, indicated by high Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (both negatively correlated with PSS), along with a significantly high heart rate Amplitude (also negatively correlated with PSS), suggests well-structured daily physiological regulation. Furthermore, a slightly below-average resting heart rate indicates good baseline cardiovascular fitness.

**Evidence for a High PSS Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several factors suggest the participant may experience elevated perceived stress. The most direct psychological indicator is the STAI-Trait score, which is classified as ""anxious"" and has a notable positive correlation (0.31) with PSS, placing the participant slightly above average in chronic anxiety proneness. Sleep disturbances are pronounced, with a self-reported ""disturbed sleep"" classification from the PSQI and significantly high day-to-day variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.14), which positively correlates with PSS. Physiologically, the participant's Mesor (mean heart rate) is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.13), and this is positively correlated with PSS, indicating a generally heightened state of physiological arousal. The low Intradaily Variability, though it reflects less physiological fluctuation within the day, also shows a positive correlation (0.16) with PSS in this dataset. The mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals a particularly high heart rate peak in the late evening (7-8 PM, Z-score 2.29), which could signify periods of acute physiological arousal or stress. Behaviorally, the complete absence of physical exercise (all Z-scores significantly negative) and significantly reduced social interaction, along with lower engagement in several other recreational activities, point towards a sedentary and potentially isolated lifestyle. While the direct correlations of these behavioral factors with PSS are low in this dataset, these are well-established risk factors for overall well-being and stress. Finally, below-average health satisfaction also weakly aligns with higher PSS.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant benefits from high self-esteem, happiness, robust circadian rhythm amplitude, and low substance use, the evidence for elevated stress is more compelling and directly linked to the PSS. The elevated trait anxiety (STAI), combined with significant sleep disturbances (PSQI and high sleep duration variability), and a consistently elevated mean heart rate (Mesor), are strong indicators. The markedly sedentary lifestyle and reduced social engagement, although not strongly correlated with PSS in this specific dataset, are significant behavioral patterns known to undermine resilience to stress. The participant appears to manage academic demands well but exhibits a pattern of psychological and physiological arousal and behavioral deficits that collectively suggest a higher burden of perceived stress. Therefore, considering the balance of evidence, particularly the psychological vulnerability (STAI), sleep quality issues, and physiological markers of arousal, it is more likely that the participant's PSS score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.
