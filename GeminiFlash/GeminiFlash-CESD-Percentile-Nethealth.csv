44869,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant sleep disturbance, elevated physiological arousal, and highly sedentary behavioral patterns, alongside some psychological strengths. Self-reported data indicate disturbed sleep quality (PSQI Z-score 1.52), which is corroborated by wearable metrics showing extreme inconsistency in sleep duration (Z-score 2.09) and sleep start times (Z-score 1.63). The median sleep duration of 8 hours 26 minutes (Z-score 1.55) is notably longer than the population average, potentially indicating hypersomnia. These sleep dysregulations are accompanied by an elevated Intradaily Variability of heart rate (Z-score 1.16), suggesting a fragmented physiological rhythm throughout the day. The circadian acrophase occurs relatively late at 5:09 PM, and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly dampened (Z-score -0.91), pointing towards a less robust or potentially shifted circadian system.

Physiologically, the participant displays markers of heightened chronic arousal, including a significantly elevated resting heart rate of 78.4 bpm (Z-score 2.41) and a high overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.97). While hourly heart rate deviations demonstrate a typical diurnal pattern, with pronounced nocturnal dips and daytime increases, the elevated baseline of the mesor suggests a general state of increased cardiovascular activity compared to the study population.

Behaviorally, a pronounced sedentary lifestyle is evident. The participant reports spending significantly more time on sedentary hobbies (Z-score 3.19) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.91). This is coupled with very low engagement in social exercise (Z-score -1.58) and sports (Z-score -1.09), suggesting limited physical activity, particularly in social contexts. In contrast, substance usage is minimal across all categories, indicating healthy choices in this domain. Psychologically, the participant reports average levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.17). However, current happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53). Counterbalancing these observations are above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.26) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55), which typically serve as protective factors against depressive symptoms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators pointing towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The most compelling evidence comes from the profound sleep disturbances, including subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 1.52), extremely high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 2.09, correlation 0.19), and significantly inconsistent sleep start times (Z-score 1.63, correlation 0.21). Physiologically, the markedly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 2.41, correlation 0.19) and mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.97, correlation 0.19) suggest chronic physiological stress or sympathetic activation, which frequently co-occurs with depressive states. Behavioral patterns of extreme sedentary activity (sedentary hobby Z-score 3.19, watching TV/videos Z-score 1.91) and significantly low social physical activity (exercised with others Z-score -1.58) are also highly indicative of reduced engagement and energy, common in depression. Furthermore, below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.46) directly aligns with lower mood.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Conversely, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.26, correlation -0.71) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55, correlation -0.39), which are strong protective factors against depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.17) are within the average range, indicating these are not significant contributing risk factors for this individual. The participant's very low substance usage across all categories also reflects positive health behaviors often associated with better mental well-being.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When weighing the evidence, the magnitude and pervasiveness of the negative indicators strongly suggest a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. The extreme Z-scores for sleep variability, physiological arousal (RHR, Mesor), and sedentary behavior represent substantial deviations from the population mean, and many of these are positively correlated with CES-D. While the above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction are significant protective factors, they appear to be outweighed by the severe dysregulation observed in sleep, physiological function, and activity levels. The combination of significantly disturbed and inconsistent sleep, heightened physiological arousal, and a highly sedentary lifestyle points towards a considerable burden of symptoms consistent with elevated CES-D scores.

92552,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable discrepancies between self-reported well-being and objective physiological and sleep disruptions. Psychologically, the individual reports higher-than-average self-esteem (Z-score: 0.82) and happiness (Z-score: 0.55), both of which show significant negative correlations with CES-D scores, suggesting a protective role. Perceived stress levels are slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.17). However, the participant is classified as anxious based on their STAI score (45.0, Z-score: 0.37), a trait that correlates very strongly and positively with CES-D (0.81). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, shows a declining trend across the academic semesters. Furthermore, self-reported health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score: -0.78), a factor negatively correlated with CES-D. Behavioral habits reveal above-average use of alcohol (beer and wine/liquor) and moderate engagement in exercise and social activities, with relatively low participation in passive entertainment like watching TV or playing video games.

Sleep patterns are a significant area of concern. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep, indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59). Objectively, while the median total sleep duration is above average at 7 hours 49 minutes (Z-score: 0.79), there is exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 174 minutes, Z-score: 1.66), which correlates positively with CES-D. The median sleep start time is notably late at 03:48:12, accompanied by above-average variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 94 minutes, Z-score: 0.25), also positively correlated with CES-D. Additionally, the participant reports a high frequency of napping (mean daily naps: 0.22, Z-score: 1.75), which similarly correlates positively with CES-D. These combined metrics point to a highly irregular and subjectively poor sleep schedule despite adequate overall duration, indicative of significant sleep disturbance.

Physiological data from wearables further elucidate profound disruptions. The participant exhibits a significantly lower mesor (63.0, Z-score: -1.49) and resting heart rate (48.8, Z-score: -1.11) compared to the population, which might typically suggest good cardiovascular fitness. However, the hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a highly atypical daily rhythm. There are extremely high physiological arousal levels during typical sleep hours (e.g., 12-1 am, Z-score: 2.03; 1-2 am, Z-score: 2.92; 2-3 am, Z-score: 4.03), suggesting nocturnal restlessness or disturbed sleep architecture. Conversely, heart rate during typical morning activity hours (e.g., 9-10 am, Z-score: -2.57; 10-11 am, Z-score: -3.25; 11-12 pm, Z-score: -3.45) is significantly blunted, potentially indicating low morning energy or reduced activity. The circadian rhythm analysis shows an acrophase (peak physiological activity) at a very late 8:48 PM, indicating a significant phase delay that aligns with the late median sleep start time. While interdaily stability is near average (Z-score: -0.24), intraday variability is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.32). This combination of nocturnal hyperarousal, morning hypoactivity, and a markedly delayed circadian rhythm, despite an overall lower resting heart rate, paints a picture of significant physiological dysregulation and desynchronization.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards the participant likely having a CES-D score in the top 50th percentile of the study population (i.e., above 11.0). The most compelling factor is the high STAI score (45.0), classifying the participant as anxious, which exhibits an exceptionally strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). This suggests that anxiety symptoms are highly concordant with depressive symptoms in this individual. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 8.0 indicates clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, a well-established comorbidity and risk factor for depression. Objective sleep data reinforces this with notably high standard deviations in both sleep duration (Z-score: 1.66) and sleep start time (Z-score: 0.25), along with frequent napping (Z-score: 1.75), all of which positively correlate with CES-D, reflecting disrupted sleep patterns often associated with depressive states. The hourly heart rate data reveals significant physiological dysregulation, specifically extreme elevations in heart rate during early morning sleep hours (Z-scores up to 4.03), suggesting nocturnal arousal that correlates positively with CES-D. Conversely, there is a pronounced blunting of heart rate during typical morning hours (Z-scores down to -3.45), which can be indicative of lethargy or reduced engagement, symptoms frequently associated with depression. The very late acrophase (8:48 PM) and median sleep start time (03:48:12) are strong indicators of a phase-delayed circadian rhythm, a common biological disruption observed in individuals with depression. Finally, the observed decline in GPA and lower self-reported health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.78), which negatively correlates with CES-D, further support a profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Some factors might suggest a lower or average CES-D score. The participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Z-score: 0.82) and happiness (Z-score: 0.55), both of which demonstrate significant negative correlations with CES-D, typically indicating a protective effect. Perceived stress levels are slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.17), which, given a positive correlation with CES-D, would imply a lower depressive symptom burden. Objectively, the participant's mesor (Z-score: -1.49) and resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.11) are significantly lower than the population mean. Considering the positive correlation between these metrics and CES-D, a lower baseline heart rate could be interpreted as being associated with lower CES-D scores. Additionally, the median sleep duration is objectively adequate or slightly above average (7 hours 49 minutes, Z-score: 0.79).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant reports certain psychological strengths such as higher self-esteem and happiness, the cumulative evidence strongly points towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The exceptionally high positive correlation of anxiety (STAI) with CES-D is a dominant indicator. This is compounded by severe subjective and objective sleep disturbances, including high variability in sleep patterns and frequent napping, which are all positively associated with CES-D. Most critically, the physiological data reveals profound circadian rhythm disruption and autonomic dysregulation, characterized by significant nocturnal hyperarousal and morning hypoactivity, coupled with a severely delayed acrophase. These objective physiological and behavioral patterns are highly characteristic of depressive states, particularly those with atypical features or significant sleep/circadian involvement. Despite some reported psychological buffers and a low overall resting heart rate, the magnitude and pervasiveness of the anxiety, sleep disruption, and physiological dysregulation provide compelling evidence to place the participant's CES-D score in the top half of the study population.

The participant demonstrates a robust profile of psychological well-being. Self-reported trait anxiety is notably low (STAI score 24.0, Z-score -1.71), indicating a disposition less prone to chronic anxiety, a trait strongly positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is exceptionally high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 50.0, Z-score 1.66), which is strongly inversely correlated with depressive symptoms (r=-0.71). This participant also reports significantly higher happiness levels (Z-score 1.64) and lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.71) compared to the study population, both of which are moderately negatively and weakly positively correlated with CES-D scores, respectively. Academic performance is consistently excellent, with GPAs near 4.0 across multiple semesters. Satisfaction with physical health is also elevated (Z-score 0.8), a factor moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39). Interpersonal trust levels are within the average range. These factors collectively suggest a resilient psychological state and strong academic functioning.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports abstaining from all surveyed substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs), placing them significantly below the population average for these behaviors. Exercise habits are mixed, characterized by frequent participation in exercise with others (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.23), a behavior weakly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.23). However, solitary exercise and participation in sports are less frequent than average. Daily recreational habits indicate higher engagement in passive entertainment such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.96). Conversely, engagement in internet usage, listening to music, reading, socializing with friends, and sedentary hobbies is notably lower than the population average. The correlations between these recreational activities and CES-D are generally weak, providing limited direct insight into depressive symptomatology from these patterns alone.

Sleep patterns reflect a combination of good subjective quality and shorter duration. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26) classifies the participant as having 'Good Sleep,' indicating infrequent sleep disturbances and satisfactory perceived sleep quality. This score is below the common clinical threshold for significant sleep disturbance. However, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.25). Despite this shorter duration, sleep start times are highly consistent (median 11:35 PM, standard deviation of 67 minutes, Z-score -0.36), and napping is absent. The negligible correlation between median sleep duration and CES-D score (r=-0.01) suggests that while sleep duration is somewhat reduced, it does not strongly predict depressive symptoms in this dataset, particularly in conjunction with the favorable PSQI score and regular schedule.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal a stable and robust cardiovascular circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average Mesor (65.92 bpm, Z-score -1.1) and a notably low resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z-score -1.18), both of which are generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. These metrics show a weak positive correlation with CES-D, implying that lower values might be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm regularity metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.16) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score -0.11), are near the population average, while Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.74) is lower than average, suggesting a more consistent daily physiological pattern. The heart rate acrophase is observed at 1:01 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a highly pronounced and early physiological activation, with heart rates surging significantly above the Mesor between 5 AM and 7 AM (Z-scores 3.1 and 4.41, respectively), marking a very robust and early awakening response. This is followed by sustained, though less extreme, elevation throughout the day, and a consistent decline in the evening hours, underscoring a well-entrained and active physiological rhythm.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits a strong and consistent pattern of indicators suggesting a low or average depressive symptom burden. Their trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.71) is significantly lower than the population mean, and this measure has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81), indicating a strong predictive relationship towards lower CES-D. Similarly, their self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score 1.66) is markedly high and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71), also predictive of lower CES-D. High self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64, r=-0.46 with CES-D) and lower perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.71, r=0.28 with CES-D) further support this interpretation. The participant also reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26), which is generally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Higher satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.8, r=-0.39 with CES-D) and less substance usage also align with a healthier psychological profile. Academically, the participant maintains an exceptional GPA, indicating strong functioning. Physiologically, a lower resting heart rate and Mesor, which weakly correlate positively with CES-D, also suggest a profile less associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards an elevated CES-D score is largely absent or weak in its predictive power. While the participant's wearable data indicates a shorter median sleep duration (6 hours 11 minutes, Z-score -1.25), a factor sometimes associated with depression, its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is negligible (r=-0.01). This potential concern is further mitigated by the participant's self-reported 'Good Sleep' quality on the PSQI and highly consistent sleep schedule. Regarding daily habits, lower engagement in activities like internet usage, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, while notable, show weak positive correlations with CES-D, meaning lower engagement would actually predict *lower* rather than higher CES-D scores according to these correlations. Socializing with friends is also reported to be less frequent than average, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible (r=-0.02). No other significant self-report or physiological measures present a compelling case for elevated depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Considering the totality of the multimodal data, the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is likely to be low or average relative to the study population. The consistently positive self-report scores across multiple, strongly correlated psychological well-being measures (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, low stress, good sleep quality) provide compelling support for this conclusion. While certain behavioral patterns like shorter sleep duration are noted, their limited or negligible correlation with CES-D, combined with the strength of other indicators, renders them insufficient to outweigh the robust evidence for a low depressive symptom profile. Therefore, the participant is most likely to fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

45963,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates a significant burden of internal distress. Scores on the STAI-Trait scale, measuring chronic anxiety, are notably elevated (Score: 62.0, Z-score: 2.05), placing the participant well above the population mean for anxiety proneness. Concurrently, self-esteem is reported as significantly below average (RSES Score: 30.0, Z-Score: -1.15), and current happiness levels are markedly low (Score: 2.0, Z-Score: -1.61). Perceived stress is also above the population average (PSS Score: 24.0, Z-Score: 0.65), as is the self-reported dissatisfaction with physical health (Score: 2.56, Z-score: -1.28). These self-report measures collectively suggest a profile of considerable emotional distress, diminished self-worth, and reduced subjective well-being.

Behavioral patterns extracted from self-reports indicate specific lifestyle choices and habits. The participant reports consuming wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, a frequency that is above the population average (Z-Score: 0.94). Engagement in solitary exercise is very low, with the participant reporting ""Not at all"" (Z-Score: -1.93), though participation in exercise with others and sports is reported as 1-2 times a week, which is at or above population averages. Recreational habits show a tendency to not engage in activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, reading, or sedentary hobbies. However, internet usage is reported as 1-2 hours daily, and listening to music is a pronounced activity, reported as 2-3 hours daily (Z-Score: 1.13), indicating a preference for this form of recreation. Socializing with friends is reported at 1-2 hours, aligning with the population average.

Sleep quality and patterns, as derived from both self-report and wearable data, are significantly disturbed. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 suggests clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance. Objective Fitbit data further reveals that while median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours 40 minutes (Z-Score: -0.64), the most striking feature is the extreme irregularity of the sleep schedule. The standard deviation of sleep start times is exceptionally high at 215 minutes (Z-Score: 2.89), indicating a profound lack of consistency in bedtime. This objective sleep irregularity is corroborated by an extremely low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.16, Z-Score: -2.06), which reflects a highly irregular daily routine in general.

Physiological data from wearable devices highlights a blunted and irregular cardiovascular rhythm. The participant exhibits an elevated average heart rate (Mesor: 81.81, Z-Score: 1.07) and resting heart rate (68.2, Z-Score: 1.2), consistent with a state of heightened physiological arousal or chronic stress. Critically, the amplitude of the circadian heart rate rhythm is extremely low (Value: 4.2, Z-Score: -2.13), indicating minimal physiological fluctuation and a flattened daily pattern of activity. This suggests a lack of distinct peaks and troughs in cardiovascular engagement throughout the day, which can be indicative of reduced vitality, anhedonia, or limited engagement with daily activities. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reinforce this pattern, showing relatively modest fluctuations that are inconsistent with robust physiological responses, especially during typical periods of high activity or deep rest. For instance, the evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, 7-8 PM) show very low deviations relative to the mesor compared to the population, reinforcing the blunted daily activity profile. Intradaily variability is below average (Z-Score: -1.09), which, in conjunction with the low amplitude and interdaily stability, further emphasizes a lack of dynamic physiological regulation.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Based on the multimodal data, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden would likely place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score.

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
*   **Psychological Distress:** The participant displays significantly elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score: 2.05), markedly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score: -1.15), and very low reported happiness (Z-score: -1.61). These metrics are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (STAI correlation: 0.81; SelfEsteem correlation: -0.71; Happy correlation: -0.46), providing robust evidence for elevated depressive symptomatology.
*   **Disturbed Sleep and Circadian Rhythms:** The PSQI score of 7.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. Objective wearable data reveals an extremely high standard deviation in sleep start times (Z-Score: 2.89) and very low interdaily stability (Z-Score: -2.06), signifying severe disruption to the daily routine and sleep-wake cycle. These patterns are strongly associated with depressive states.
*   **Blunted Physiological Reactivity:** The most compelling physiological indicator is the extremely low amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm (Z-Score: -2.13). This suggests a significantly blunted physiological response to daily activities, often observed in individuals experiencing anhedonia, apathy, or reduced psychomotor activity associated with depression.
*   **Elevated Arousal and Stress:** An elevated resting heart rate (Z-Score: 1.2) and mesor (Z-Score: 1.07), coupled with above-average perceived stress (Z-Score: 0.65) and low health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.28), further point towards a sustained state of physiological and psychological strain.
*   **Behavioral Indicators:** Low engagement in solitary exercise (Z-Score: -1.93) and many sedentary recreational activities, alongside elevated alcohol consumption, may reflect coping mechanisms or reduced motivation common in depressive contexts.

**Evidence for Low/Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
*   The participant maintains a high GPA, indicating functional academic performance.
*   Engagement in some social physical activities (exercising with others, sports) is at or above average.
*   Interpersonal trust is slightly above average.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence strongly points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The combination of pronounced psychological distress (high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness), severe objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and a profoundly blunted and irregular physiological circadian rhythm (especially the extremely low heart rate amplitude and interdaily stability) aligns with a profile of significant depressive symptomatology. While academic performance is high and some social engagement in exercise exists, these do not sufficiently counteract the numerous and severe indicators of distress and dysfunction across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains. The strong correlations of several key self-report measures with CES-D further solidify this interpretation. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

22138,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"The analysis below synthesizes self-reported psychological traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiological data to interpret the participant’s psychological state and potential depressive symptoms.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile reveals a complex interplay of traits, with prominent indicators of both distress and resilience. They report a notably high level of trait anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score = 0.86), classifying them as 'anxious' and showing a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, perceived stress is also elevated, with a PSS score of 24.0 (Z-score = 0.65), which moderately correlates (0.28) with CES-D. Furthermore, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53, correlation = -0.46), lower interpersonal trust (Z-score = -0.78, correlation = -0.41), and reduced satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score = -0.62, correlation = -0.39). These patterns collectively suggest a disposition towards psychological distress and dissatisfaction in several life domains. However, counteracting these tendencies, the participant also reports exceptionally high self-esteem, with an RSES score of 42.0 (Z-score = 0.54), a trait that strongly negatively correlates with CES-D scores (-0.71).

In terms of daily habits, the participant's sleep patterns present a nuanced picture. While subjectively reporting 'Good Sleep' via the PSQI (Z-score = -0.8), objective Fitbit data reveals slightly longer median sleep duration (7 hours 32 minutes, Z-score = 0.43). However, there is notably higher variability in sleep start time (121 minutes, Z-score = 0.83) and less napping (Z-score = -0.86) compared to the population, both of which moderately positively correlate with higher CES-D scores (0.22 and 0.21, respectively). Additionally, less variability in sleep duration (Z-score = -0.43) is also associated with a positive correlation to CES-D (0.2). Regarding physical activity, the participant actively avoids exercising alone (Z-score = -1.93) and participating in sports (Z-score = -1.09), yet engages frequently in exercise with others (three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.23), a behavior moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23). Recreational habits show elevated engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos (Z-score = 1.28) and internet usage (Z-score = 0.85), both weakly to moderately correlating positively with CES-D (0.13 and 0.25). Conversely, time spent listening to music (Z-score = -0.72) and socializing with friends (Z-score = -0.62) is below average, with less music listening correlating positively with CES-D (0.25). Alcohol consumption, particularly wine or liquor, is somewhat above average (Z-score = 0.94), but recreational drug use is absent.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicates a distinctive heart rate-based circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits above-average interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.5) and below-average intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.53), suggesting a relatively consistent and less fragmented daily heart rate pattern. The MESOR, or mean heart rate, is slightly elevated at 77.51 bpm (Z-score = 0.49), as is the resting heart rate at 60.6 bpm (Z-score = 0.29), both showing weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.19). A larger heart rate amplitude (Z-score = 0.73) indicates a more pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates, with a weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.1). The acrophase, representing the peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed relatively late in the day at 4:20 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveals prominent peaks in physiological arousal during the early afternoon (e.g., 1-2 PM, deviation of 14.85 with Z-score = 1.1) and evening hours (e.g., 6-7 PM, deviation of 17.25 with Z-score = 0.82), indicating periods of significantly higher cardiovascular activity compared to population averages. A sharp decline towards baseline heart rates occurs in the late evening, specifically between 10 PM and midnight.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant reports exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score = 0.54), a trait strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores (correlation = -0.71). Subjective sleep quality is also reported as good (PSQI Z-score = -0.8). Furthermore, the participant frequently engages in exercise with others (Z-score = 1.23), which shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23). Physiologically, a larger heart rate amplitude (Z-score = 0.73) and less intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score = -0.53) are observed, both having weak negative correlations with CES-D (-0.1 and -0.05, respectively), suggesting more robust and consistent physiological rhythms.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, there is substantial evidence suggesting an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant exhibits notably high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.86), which carries a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Elevated perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.65, correlation = 0.28) and lower self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53, correlation = -0.46) further contribute to this picture. Indicators of reduced social connection, such as lower interpersonal trust (Z-score = -0.78, correlation = -0.41) and less time socializing with friends (Z-score = -0.62), coupled with lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -0.39), are also present and negatively correlated with CES-D. Behavioral patterns include increased passive media consumption (TV/videos and internet usage, Z-scores 1.28 and 0.85 respectively), which weakly to moderately correlate positively with CES-D (0.13 and 0.25). Less engagement in listening to music (Z-score = -0.72) also correlates positively with CES-D (0.25). Objective sleep data shows increased variability in sleep start time (Z-score = 0.83, correlation = 0.22) and less napping (Z-score = -0.86, correlation = 0.21), both associated with higher CES-D. Even less variability in sleep duration (Z-score = -0.43) unexpectedly correlates positively with CES-D (0.2). Physiologically, slightly elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score = 0.49, correlation = 0.19) and resting heart rate (Z-score = 0.29, correlation = 0.19) are also weakly associated with higher CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite strong self-esteem and subjective good sleep, the participant presents a compelling aggregate of factors consistent with an elevated CES-D score. The very high trait anxiety, elevated stress, reduced happiness, and lower trust and health satisfaction, all of which are directly related to psychological distress and have moderate to very strong correlations with CES-D, weigh heavily. While high self-esteem offers a protective factor, its correlation magnitude (-0.71) is slightly less impactful than the very strong positive correlation of trait anxiety (0.81). Furthermore, multiple objective sleep and behavioral patterns, such as increased variability in sleep start time, reduced napping, and higher passive media consumption, align with indicators for increased depressive symptoms. The slightly elevated physiological arousal further supports this. Therefore, considering the overall pattern and the relative strengths of the correlations, the evidence points more strongly towards the participant experiencing a higher burden of depressive symptoms compared to the study population.

The participant exhibits a pattern of elevated psychological distress, notably higher trait anxiety as indicated by a STAI score of 49.0 (Z-score = 0.76), classified as ""anxious."" This measure correlates strongly with depressive symptoms (0.81). Perceived stress is also slightly above the population average (PSS score = 23.0, Z-score = 0.38), positively correlating with CES-D scores. Furthermore, the participant reports lower happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and significantly reduced interpersonal trust (Z-score = -1.42), both of which show negative correlations with CES-D. Health satisfaction is below average (Z-score = -0.45), also negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. In contrast, self-esteem is approximately average (Z-score = 0.11), and given its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), this suggests it does not contribute to an elevated depressive symptom profile.

Sleep patterns show signs of disturbance; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, despite a slightly below-average Z-score (-0.33) relative to the study population. Objective sleep duration is shorter than average, at 6 hours and 41 minutes (Z-score = -0.61), and sleep duration exhibits slightly higher variability (standard deviation of 110 minutes, Z-score = 0.22), which is positively correlated with CES-D. While sleep start time variability is below average, the overall picture points to compromised sleep.

Physiological data from wearables reveal a state of elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The participant's resting heart rate (78.2 bpm) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 91.39 bpm) are both significantly elevated, reflected by Z-scores of 2.38 for both metrics, and both positively correlate with CES-D. Analysis of the circadian rhythm from heart rate data indicates a lower amplitude (Z-score = -0.5), suggesting a blunted daily physiological fluctuation, and a relatively late acrophase at 4:05 PM, indicating a delayed peak in activity. Intradaily variability is notably low (Z-score = -1.24), implying a highly stable heart rate pattern within days, which, in conjunction with blunted amplitude, could suggest reduced physiological responsiveness. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate relatively less pronounced dips during typical sleep hours (evidenced by more positive Z-scores for negative deviations, e.g., 4-5am Z=0.57) and somewhat less pronounced peaks during active evening hours (evidenced by more negative Z-scores for positive deviations, e.g., 6-7pm Z=-0.97) when compared to the study population.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in exercise at an above-average frequency, both alone and with others, which generally correlates negatively with depressive symptoms. However, alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor) is also above average. Recreational habits indicate significantly higher engagement in passive media consumption like watching TV/videos (Z-score = 1.28) and reading (Z-score = 1.3), while internet usage is notably lower than average (Z-score = -1.16). Socializing with friends is at an average frequency. The strong academic performance (GPA consistently above 3.4) and a healthy Body Mass Index (21.03) suggest good academic functioning and no overt physical health concerns based on these metrics.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%)**:
Multiple indicators align with an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant's trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.76), lower reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53), lower trust (Z-score = -1.42), elevated perceived stress (Z-score = 0.38), and reduced health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.45) all point towards higher depressive symptoms, supported by their respective correlations with CES-D. Notably, the STAI score has a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D. Objectively, the PSQI score of 6.0 indicates clinically disturbed sleep, and Fitbit data corroborates shorter sleep duration (Z-score = -0.61) and increased sleep duration variability (Z-score = 0.22), which is positively correlated with CES-D. Physiologically, both resting heart rate and the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) are significantly elevated (both Z-scores = 2.38), which are positively correlated with CES-D. Furthermore, a blunted circadian rhythm amplitude (Z-score = -0.5) and a delayed acrophase are patterns often associated with mood disturbances.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%)**:
In contrast, self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score = 0.11). Given its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), this average score would suggest a relatively lower CES-D score than if self-esteem were low. The participant also reports above-average engagement in exercise, a behavior typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. Significantly lower internet usage (Z-score = -1.16), which has a positive correlation with CES-D, could also suggest a tendency towards lower depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis**:
While certain factors like average self-esteem, higher exercise frequency, and lower internet usage might suggest a lower depressive symptom burden, the overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a higher CES-D score. The participant presents with marked self-reported psychological distress, including high anxiety, stress, and low happiness, trust, and health satisfaction. These are compounded by objective and subjective sleep disturbances and significant physiological dysregulation characterized by an elevated baseline heart rate and blunted circadian rhythm. The magnitude of the Z-scores and the strength of the correlations for factors pointing to higher depressive symptoms (especially STAI, Happy, Trust, RHR, Mesor) considerably outweigh the counter-indicators. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

46558,17.0,0.727979274611399,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a generally positive self-reported psychological profile. They report significantly higher levels of current happiness (Z-score 1.64) and above-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), both of which are strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Concurrently, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is lower than the population average (Z-score -0.43), indicating a reduced predisposition to chronic anxiety, a factor highly correlated with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score 0.1). Furthermore, the participant reports above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8) and a higher degree of interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5), both moderately associated with lower CES-D scores. These self-reported psychological indicators collectively suggest a resilient and generally positive mental state that is protective against depressive symptomatology.

Sleep patterns and circadian rhythms appear to be highly stable and conducive to well-being. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (Score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), falling below the common clinical cutoff for sleep disturbance. Wearable data reinforces this, showing an adequate median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, with notably low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.98) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.61). The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further contributes to a consistent sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data support this regularity, with above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.83), indicating consistent day-to-day rhythmicity, and average intradaily variability (Z-score 0.32). The heart rate acrophase occurs at 5:17 PM, a typical timing for peak physiological activity. The resting heart rate (60.7 bpm, Z-score 0.3) is within a healthy range. The overall pattern of highly consistent and good-quality sleep, coupled with stable physiological rhythms, is generally associated with robust mental health and is protective against depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a notably sedentary lifestyle, characterized by significantly low engagement in physical exercise. Both individual exercise (Z-score -1.18) and exercise with others (Z-score -1.58) are well below the population average, as is participation in sports (Z-score -1.09). Conversely, time spent on sedentary recreational activities is markedly elevated, particularly video gaming (Z-score 3.23) and general sedentary hobbies (Z-score 2.01). Time spent watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (Z-score 0.85) are also higher than average. Despite these sedentary habits, the participant reports above-average time spent socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95), which is a positive social engagement. Substance usage is generally low or non-existent, indicating no reliance on such coping mechanisms. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern of physiological arousal, with expected troughs during sleep and peaks in the afternoon and evening, consistent with the acrophase. While specific hourly deviations show some variation from population means, there is no overall pattern suggesting chronic hyper- or hypo-arousal. The low levels of physical activity, despite high social engagement and typical physiological arousal patterns, could represent a behavioral risk factor, although its direct correlation with CES-D in this dataset is generally low.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological well-being metrics provide strong evidence for a lower depressive symptom burden. Their current happiness (Z-score 1.64), self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), and trait anxiety (Z-score -0.43) are all significantly more favorable than the population average and exhibit strong to moderate negative correlations with CES-D scores. Additionally, self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8), and interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5) are all positive indicators associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Wearable data corroborates these findings, revealing consistent and adequate sleep duration with low variability in sleep start and duration, alongside high interdaily stability in heart rate rhythms. These robust and multifaceted indicators strongly suggest that the participant experiences relatively low or average depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The primary evidence that might suggest a higher CES-D score comes from the participant's activity patterns. They report significantly lower physical exercise levels across all categories (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.58) and notably higher engagement in sedentary activities, especially video gaming (Z-score 3.23) and general sedentary hobbies (Z-score 2.01). While a sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise are generally considered risk factors for poorer mental health, the provided correlations between these specific activity metrics and the CES-D score are relatively weak (ranging from -0.09 to 0.13), indicating they are not strong predictors of depressive symptoms in this dataset for this individual.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When holistically evaluating the evidence, the participant's overall profile overwhelmingly points towards a lower or median CES-D score. The numerous and robust positive self-reported psychological indicators (high happiness, self-esteem, low anxiety, good sleep quality, high trust, health satisfaction) are strongly associated with lower depressive symptom levels. These subjective reports are further supported by objective wearable data indicating excellent sleep consistency and stable circadian rhythms, which are generally protective against depression. While the participant's notably low physical activity and high sedentary screen time represent a potential behavioral risk, the correlations provided for these specific behaviors with CES-D are low, and these habits do not appear to translate into compromised psychological well-being or physiological distress in other measured domains for this individual. The strength and consistency of the protective factors far outweigh the weaker and less directly correlated risk factors. Therefore, it is highly likely that this participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, falls within the lower half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
93699,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"The participant's self-reported psychological measures indicate several areas of potential vulnerability. They report elevated trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 44.0 (Z-score 0.27), classifying them as 'anxious' relative to the study population. This is a particularly salient finding given its strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.82). Concurrently, their self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is below average (Score 35.0, Z-score -0.45), which also exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71). Further suggesting a predisposition to lower mood, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and significantly lower satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -1.11), both of which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D. Interpersonal trust is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.46), with a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.41) with depressive symptoms. Notably, despite these indicators, the participant reports significantly lower perceived stress than the average student (PSS score 13.0, Z-score -2.34), a finding that presents a nuanced picture, especially considering its weak positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.28).

Sleep patterns and physiological rhythms show a mix of regularity and disturbance. The participant reports poor subjective sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance. Wearable data reinforces this with a slightly lower-than-average median sleep duration of 6 hours 51 minutes (Z-score -0.42) and a relatively late median sleep start time (00:58:59). Both sleep duration and start time exhibit slightly higher variability (Z-score 0.16 and 0.14, respectively), and these variabilities are weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting that less consistent sleep is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The participant also reports significantly fewer naps than the average student (Z-score -0.86). Despite these sleep challenges, the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm exhibits higher-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81), indicating a regular daily rhythm in physiological activity, though these metrics show negligible correlation with CES-D. However, the participant's mean heart rate (Mesor: 79.36 bpm, Z-score 0.74) and resting heart rate (64.8 bpm, Z-score 0.79) are both above the population average, correlating weakly positively with CES-D (r = 0.19), suggesting higher baseline cardiovascular activity may be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Hourly heart rate data shows a typical diurnal fluctuation, with the acrophase (peak physiological activity) occurring relatively late at 4:00 PM, and the highest deviation from mesor observed between 12-1 PM (16.31 bpm, Z-score 1.22).

Behavioral habits further contextualize the participant's profile. Their daily recreation is characterized by significantly higher-than-average internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and above-average television/video consumption (Z-score 1.28). Internet usage, in particular, has a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.26). Conversely, the participant reports less time socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and engaging in reading or video games, activities that generally contribute to well-being. Time spent listening to music is also below average (Z-score -0.72), which correlates positively with CES-D (r = 0.25), meaning lower engagement with music is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Regarding physical activity, the participant demonstrates a preference for social exercise, engaging in exercise with others at an above-average frequency (Z-score 0.53), but exercises alone less frequently (Z-score -0.43) and does not participate in sports. Substance use is generally low, with beer consumption at the population average, and wine/liquor use and recreational/non-prescribed drug use below average or non-existent, with negligible correlations to CES-D. Academically, the participant maintains a consistent and above-average GPA.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50% of the study population) is robust and multifaceted. The participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.27, classified as 'anxious') and significantly lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), both of which have strong correlations with CES-D (0.82 and -0.71, respectively). Furthermore, their subjective experience of sleep is severely disturbed (PSQI Z-score 1.05), and they report lower levels of happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -1.11), factors also moderately to strongly associated with higher depressive symptomatology (correlations of -0.46 and -0.39). Behavioral indicators like significantly high internet usage (Z-score 2.19, correlation 0.26) and less time spent listening to music (Z-score -0.72, correlation 0.25) also align with higher CES-D scores. Wearable data shows higher-than-average mean and resting heart rates (Z-score 0.74 and 0.79, respectively) with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (0.19), along with higher variability in sleep duration and start times (Z-scores 0.16 and 0.14) which weakly correlate with higher CES-D.

Conversely, the primary evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50% of the study population) is the participant's significantly lower-than-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score -2.34). While a lower stress score generally suggests lower depressive symptoms, its correlation with CES-D is weak (0.28). The high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation in heart rate-derived circadian rhythm suggest good physiological regularity, which might be a protective factor, but these metrics show negligible correlation with CES-D. Their engagement in social exercise (Z-score 0.53) and low substance use are also potentially beneficial but do not strongly counteract the more direct indicators of depressive symptoms.

Considering the cumulative weight of evidence, the strong and consistent signals from self-reported anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction, and disturbed sleep, along with key behavioral patterns like increased internet usage and reduced engagement in activities typically associated with well-being (like music listening and social interaction), strongly suggest an elevated depressive symptom burden. While the low perceived stress score is an interesting anomaly, it is substantially outweighed by the numerous and more strongly correlated indicators pointing towards higher depressive symptoms.

84011,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"This analysis synthesizes self-reported psychological and behavioral data with wearable-derived physiological and sleep metrics to interpret the participant's overall psychological state and behavioral patterns, with a focus on indicators relevant to depressive symptoms.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex psychological profile marked by elevated internal anxieties and challenges in self-perception, yet alongside notable resilience in perceived external stressors and general well-being. Self-reported trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI (score 44.0, Z-score 0.27), is slightly above the study population average and categorized as ""anxious,"" a characteristic strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.82). Concurrently, self-esteem (RSES score 33.0, Z-score -0.73) is notably below average, indicating lower self-worth, which also exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). In contrast, the participant reports lower perceived stress (PSS score 20.0, Z-score -0.44) than the average, alongside above-average happiness (score 4.0, Z-score 0.55) and satisfaction with physical health (score 5.0, Z-score 0.55). These latter positive indicators are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (happiness -0.46, health satisfaction -0.39), suggesting they may act as protective factors. This discrepancy between elevated anxiety and low self-esteem on one hand, and relatively low perceived stress and high reported happiness/health satisfaction on the other, points to an internal emotional landscape where internal self-perception challenges are prominent despite a more positive outlook on external circumstances and general life satisfaction.

Sleep patterns present a combination of subjective disturbance and objective robustness. The participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, while below the population average (Z-score -0.33), still indicates clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (a score above 5). Objectively, however, Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 28 minutes, significantly above the population average (Z-score 1.59), accompanied by relatively consistent sleep duration (standard deviation of 84 minutes, Z-score -0.38) and average consistency in sleep start times (standard deviation of 82 minutes, Z-score -0.02). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data suggest a slightly less regular pattern of activity over days (Interdaily Stability 0.35, Z-score -0.49) and more fragmentation of activity within days (Intradaily Variability 0.69, Z-score 1.02). The participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor 63.1, Z-score -1.48) and resting heart rate (51.4, Z-score -0.8) are both notably below average, indicating a generally lower physiological baseline. The heart rate rhythm exhibits a moderate amplitude (9.78, Z-score -0.32) and a relatively late acrophase at 3:54 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveals distinct daily physiological patterns, with particularly elevated activity observed in the late morning, early afternoon, and a very strong peak in the early evening (8-9 PM, Z-score 2.19), followed by a sharp decline in the subsequent hour. This suggests periods of significant physiological arousal punctuated by marked resting phases.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical activity, particularly in social contexts. They report exercising with others and participating in sports ""Three times a week or more,"" with corresponding Z-scores of 1.23 and 1.58, respectively, placing them well above the population average for these activities. Exercising with others carries a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23), suggesting a potentially protective role against depressive symptoms. Conversely, engagement in various other recreational activities is relatively low. Self-reported time spent socializing with friends (""16-30 minutes,"" Z-score -1.41) is considerably below average, as is listening to music (Z-score -1.19), video games, and reading. Substance use is generally low across all categories, indicating a lack of problematic substance use. This behavioral profile suggests a focused investment in structured physical activity, which can be a positive coping mechanism, but a comparatively limited engagement in other forms of social and recreational leisure.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

To assess whether the participant's CES-D score is likely in the top or bottom half of the study population (median CES-D: 11.5), we weigh the available evidence, considering both the Z-scores and the correlations of each metric with the CES-D score.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for a higher CES-D score stems from two key self-reported psychological measures. The participant's STAI score (Z-score 0.27) is slightly above average and classified as ""anxious,"" a measure with a very strong positive correlation to CES-D (0.82). This indicates that higher trait anxiety is highly associated with a greater burden of depressive symptoms. Additionally, their self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) is significantly below the population average, and this measure has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), implying that lower self-esteem is strongly linked to higher depressive symptomatology. While the PSQI score (6.0) indicates subjective sleep disturbance, its Z-score (-0.33) is below average, suggesting relatively less disturbance than the overall population average; however, any sleep disturbance can contribute to depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Several factors suggest a potentially lower or average CES-D score. The participant reports lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.44) and above-average levels of happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55). These three metrics are negatively correlated with CES-D (stress 0.28 implies lower stress -> lower CESD, happiness -0.46, health satisfaction -0.39), suggesting protective effects. Objectively, wearable data shows significantly above-average median sleep duration (Z-score 1.59) and below-average sleep duration variability (Z-score -0.38), indicating robust and consistent sleep patterns. While the correlation of sleep duration with CES-D is negligible (0.0), good objective sleep is generally a positive health indicator. Furthermore, the participant demonstrates very high engagement in physical activity, particularly exercising with others and sports (Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58, respectively). Exercising with others has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23), indicating it serves as a protective behavioral mechanism. Substance use is also generally low across all categories.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant presents a mixed profile with significant indicators pointing in both directions. However, the influence of elevated trait anxiety and markedly low self-esteem is particularly strong due to their very high correlation magnitudes with CES-D (0.82 and -0.71, respectively). These core psychological traits are fundamental to an individual's vulnerability to depressive symptoms. While protective factors such as lower perceived stress, higher happiness, better health satisfaction, positive objective sleep metrics, and high physical activity are present, their correlations with CES-D are generally weaker or negligible compared to trait anxiety and self-esteem. The combination of above-average trait anxiety and below-average self-esteem, given their strong associations with depressive symptoms, suggests that these factors would likely exert a greater upward pull on the participant's CES-D score. Therefore, despite the presence of several favorable factors, the substantial psychological vulnerabilities indicated by STAI and Self-Esteem scores likely place the participant's overall depressive symptom burden in the top half of the study population.

88008,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"The participant’s self-reported psychological profile indicates several vulnerabilities that are commonly associated with depressive symptomatology. Their score on the STAI-Trait scale is elevated (Z-score 0.66), indicating higher-than-average chronic anxiety, a trait strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably lower than the population average (Z-score -0.73), which also exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (r=-0.71). Similarly, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) with a moderate negative correlation (r=-0.46), and trust in others is lower (Z-score -0.78) with a moderate negative correlation (r=-0.41). These indicators collectively suggest a psychological landscape characterized by elevated anxiety, diminished self-worth, and reduced overall well-being. Counteracting these, the participant reports lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.44) and higher satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -0.7), both of which are generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is also reported as good (Z-score -0.8).

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits several health-promoting habits. They report no usage of alcohol or recreational drugs, indicating an absence of substance-related risk factors. Exercise frequency is consistently high, with participation in solitary exercise and sports occurring ""three times a week or more"" (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58, respectively), and exercising with others ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.53). These high levels of physical activity are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms, as indicated by modest negative correlations with CES-D. Daily recreational habits include average to slightly above-average engagement in screen-based activities like watching TV/videos (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64) and playing video games (16-30 minutes, Z-score 0.96), with average internet usage and socializing with friends. Reading engagement is also high (16-30 minutes, Z-score 1.3). The overall pattern suggests a structured lifestyle with a strong commitment to physical activity.

Wearable data reveals a complex sleep and physiological circadian rhythm profile. Objectively, the participant's median sleep duration is notably short at 6 hours 9 minutes (Z-score -1.29), falling well below the population average. This short duration, despite subjectively reported good sleep quality, is a significant objective finding often associated with increased health risks. Sleep duration variability is lower than average (Z-score -0.75), indicating relatively consistent sleep durations night-to-night. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data demonstrate remarkable stability and robustness: interdaily stability is high (Z-score 0.91), indicating consistent day-to-day patterns, while intradaily variability is exceptionally low (Z-score -1.73), suggesting minimal fragmentation within the daily rhythm. The circadian amplitude is significantly high (Z-score 1.48), reflecting a robust difference between peak and trough heart rates, and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also high (Z-score 0.73), reinforcing the strong daily rhythmicity. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:06 PM, consistent with typical diurnal activity patterns. The overall mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above average (Z-score 0.61), while the resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.36), which is often indicative of good cardiovascular fitness.

Aggregated hourly heart rate data further supports a robust and consistent daily physiological pattern. During the nighttime hours (approximately 1 AM to 6 AM), heart rate deviations from the mesor are significantly negative, consistent with periods of rest and sleep. As the morning progresses (7-8 AM), heart rate begins to rise towards the mesor. Throughout the daytime and into the evening (from 9 AM to approximately 10 PM), heart rate consistently remains above the mesor, reflecting typical waking activity and physiological arousal. Notable peaks in heart rate activity are observed in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM, Z-score 1.19; 7-8 PM, Z-score 1.39; 8-9 PM, Z-score 1.44), suggesting periods of heightened physical or cognitive engagement. The consistent pattern of these hourly deviations indicates a predictable and strong diurnal rhythm in cardiovascular activity, with expected periods of physiological decline during rest and elevation during activity.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a higher CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological states. Their elevated STAI-Trait score (Z-score 0.66, classified as anxious) has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81). Simultaneously, their lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) exhibits a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71). Additionally, reduced self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.78) are moderately correlated with higher CES-D scores (r=-0.46 and r=-0.41, respectively). These core psychological vulnerabilities are highly pertinent to depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the objective wearable data shows a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours 9 minutes (Z-score -1.29), which is a known risk factor for mental health issues and contributes to a profile of heightened vulnerability despite subjective reports of good sleep.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Conversely, significant evidence supports a relatively lower or average CES-D score. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8) and lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.44), both of which are associated with better mental well-being. Their health satisfaction is also higher than average (Z-score -0.7). Lifestyle behaviors are largely protective, with no reported substance use and high engagement in various forms of exercise (all Z-scores positive and above 0.53, with modest negative correlations to CES-D). Physiologically, the wearable data indicates an exceptionally stable and robust circadian rhythm, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.91), very low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.73), high amplitude (Z-score 1.48), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.73). These metrics reflect a highly regular and strong physiological rhythm that is generally considered protective against mood disturbances. Their resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.36), and sleep duration standard deviation is lower than average (Z-score -0.75), suggesting consistency.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile presents a stark contrast between strong psychological vulnerabilities and robust behavioral and physiological health markers. The self-reported psychological traits (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, trust) show very strong correlations with CES-D scores in the population, directly indicating a predisposition toward elevated depressive symptoms. The objectively short sleep duration further adds to this risk profile, regardless of subjective sleep quality. While the participant engages in many protective behaviors (exercise, no substance use) and exhibits an exceptionally stable and robust physiological circadian rhythm, the direct and highly correlated psychological indicators carry substantial weight in predicting overall depressive symptom burden. Given the magnitude of the correlations for the psychological self-report measures, these factors are likely to exert a stronger influence on the CES-D score than the protective physiological and behavioral factors, whose correlations with CES-D are generally much weaker. Therefore, despite significant areas of resilience, the pervasive and strongly linked psychological vulnerabilities, coupled with objectively short sleep, suggest a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms.

**Psychological Traits and Mental Well-being:**
This participant exhibits a profile marked by significant psychological distress, with several self-report measures indicating elevated symptom burden. Their trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated (Score: 62.0, Z-score: 2.05), placing them well above the average study population and warranting a classification of ""anxious."" This high anxiety shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is considerably low (Score: 29.0, Z-Score: -1.29), a factor that is strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Self-reported current happiness is also markedly low (Score: 2.0, Z-Score: -1.61), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.45). The participant reports above-average perceived stress (PSS Score: 24.0, Z-Score: 0.65), a metric positively correlated with CES-D (0.28). Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" according to the PSQI (Score: 8.0, Z-Score: 0.59), indicating significant difficulties in this domain. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.37), with a negative correlation to CES-D (-0.39). These self-reported measures collectively suggest a state of considerable emotional and psychological burden. Despite these challenges, the participant maintains a strong academic record with consistent GPAs above 3.5.

**Behavioral Patterns and Social Engagement:**
Analysis of the participant's lifestyle behaviors reveals broad disengagement from various activities. Engagement in exercise is notably low, particularly in social contexts (""Exercised with Others"": ""Not at all"", Z-Score: -1.58) and structured sports (""Sports"": ""Not at all"", Z-Score: -1.09), both significantly below the population mean. Similarly, participation in several daily recreational activities is minimal or absent, including watching TV/videos/movies (""Do not do"", Z-Score: -1.25), reading (""Do not do"", Z-Score: -0.67), and engaging in sedentary hobbies (""Do not do"", Z-Score: -0.96). Socializing with friends is also below average (""31 minutes an hour"", Z-Score: -0.62). This widespread lack of engagement across social, physical, and leisure domains suggests a pattern consistent with reduced interest or pleasure in activities. In contrast, substance usage is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, indicating an absence of these coping behaviors.

**Physiological Indicators and Circadian Rhythms:**
Wearable-derived heart rate data indicate an elevated baseline physiological arousal. The participant's Mesor (mean heart rate) is notably high (84.83 bpm, Z-Score: 1.49), as is their resting heart rate (69.4 bpm, Z-Score: 1.34), both showing a mild positive correlation with CES-D (0.18). These elevated cardiovascular markers suggest a state of chronic physiological activation relative to the study population. The daily pattern of heart rate deviation from the Mesor reveals typical diurnal fluctuations, with lower heart rates during sleep periods and higher rates during waking hours, peaking in the afternoon and early evening. However, these fluctuations occur around a higher overall baseline. Circadian rhythm stability, as measured by Interdaily Stability (Z-Score: 0.09) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-Score: 0.9), appears to be within or slightly above average, suggesting a relatively consistent daily rhythm, even if the overall heart rate level is elevated. Intradaily Variability is slightly above average (Z-Score: 0.24), which could suggest some fragmentation, but it is not highly pronounced.

**Sleep Metrics:**
The participant's sleep patterns show a distinct profile. Fitbit data indicates a long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 8 minutes (Z-Score: 1.18), placing them significantly above the population average for sleep time. Both the variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 65 minutes, Z-Score: -0.82) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 66 minutes, Z-Score: -0.37) are lower than average, suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule. However, despite these seemingly positive objective sleep metrics, the self-reported PSQI score classifies their subjective sleep quality as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating a discrepancy between objective duration/regularity and subjective experience of restorative sleep. The correlations between lower sleep variability (duration and start time) and higher CES-D scores (0.21 and 0.22 respectively) are somewhat counterintuitive, possibly suggesting a rigid but unrefreshing sleep pattern or reflecting a complex interplay between sleep regulation and mood. Napping is absent (Z-Score: -0.86), which also correlates positively with CES-D (0.22).

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The evidence strongly suggests that this participant's depressive symptom burden is likely in the top half of the study population distribution. Several key self-report measures are highly indicative: an exceptionally high trait anxiety score (STAI Z-score: 2.05, correlation with CES-D: 0.81), very low self-esteem (Z-score: -1.29, correlation: -0.71), and notably low self-reported happiness (Z-score: -1.61, correlation: -0.45). Each of these factors, especially given their extreme Z-scores and strong correlations with CES-D, points towards elevated depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average perceived stress (Z-score: 0.65) and ""Disturbed Sleep"" (PSQI score of 8), both common features associated with depression. Behaviorally, there is widespread disengagement from social and recreational activities, including significantly low participation in exercise, sports, watching TV, reading, and social interaction. This pattern of anhedonia and social withdrawal is a cardinal feature often associated with depressive symptoms. Physiologically, both the Mesor and Resting Heart Rate are significantly elevated (Z-scores 1.49 and 1.34 respectively), indicating a heightened state of physiological arousal consistent with chronic stress and anxiety, and these also show mild positive correlations with CES-D.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Some aspects of the data might, at first glance, suggest a lower CES-D score, though their interpretive weight is less when viewed holistically. The participant exhibits no substance use, which can be a protective factor against some maladaptive coping mechanisms, although its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is negligible. Academically, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA, suggesting cognitive functioning and academic performance are not overtly impaired. Objective Fitbit data shows a long median sleep duration of over 8 hours and relatively low variability in sleep duration and start times, which might typically be considered positive sleep hygiene. Circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation at 24 hours, are average or slightly above, indicating a relatively stable daily heart rate rhythm. However, these seemingly positive sleep and circadian regularity measures are contradicted by the self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" and elevated physiological arousal (Mesor, RHR). Moreover, the positive correlations between lower sleep variability and higher CES-D scores in this specific population suggest that consistency in this case does not necessarily equate to restorative sleep or lower symptom burden.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the evidence, the overwhelming indicators of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, high perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, significant behavioral disengagement, and elevated physiological arousal strongly outweigh the factors that might suggest a lower or average CES-D score. The extreme Z-scores and high correlations with CES-D for several key psychological measures, coupled with behavioral patterns highly consistent with depressive symptoms, point to a participant experiencing a substantial burden of depressive symptomatology. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's overall CES-D score falls within the top 50% of the study population distribution.

87032,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notable pattern of elevated psychological distress and compromised well-being, particularly in areas highly associated with depressive symptomatology. Subjective sleep quality is significantly poor, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), placing the participant considerably above the population mean for sleep disturbance. This is further compounded by elevated perceived stress (PSS score 26.0, Z-score 1.19). Affective measures reveal below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.31), both of which are strongly to moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Trait anxiety, measured by the STAI, is slightly above average (Z-score 0.27) and shows a very strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D, suggesting a high co-occurrence of anxiety with depressive symptoms in this individual. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score -0.53). Collectively, these self-reported indicators suggest a significant burden of psychological and emotional difficulties.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly sedentary lifestyle. Self-reported exercise frequency is consistently ""Not at all"" across individual and group activities, with associated Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93, indicating significantly less exercise than the study population average. This low physical activity is accompanied by notably high engagement in sedentary recreational pursuits, including watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.91), extensive internet usage (Z-score 2.19), prolonged listening to music (Z-score 2.06), and above-average reading time (Z-score 2.28). While substance use is minimal and academic performance (GPA) remains strong, the overall behavioral profile is characterized by a lack of physical activity and a high prevalence of passive leisure, which can sometimes be observed in individuals experiencing depressive states.

Wearable-derived sleep statistics corroborate the self-reported sleep disturbance. The median sleep duration is slightly shorter than average at 6 hours 43 minutes (Z-score -0.58). More critically, the participant's sleep start times exhibit significant variability (standard deviation 145 minutes, Z-score 1.36), indicating an irregular sleep schedule. An elevated frequency of daily naps (Z-score 1.27) further suggests potential fatigue or compensatory napping due to inadequate or disrupted nighttime sleep. The notable variability in sleep start times and increased napping are weakly but positively correlated with higher CES-D scores, reinforcing their potential relevance to depressive symptoms.

Physiological data from heart rate metrics suggest an elevated basal level of physiological arousal and disrupted circadian rhythmicity. Both the resting heart rate (Z-score 1.34) and the overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.56) are significantly above the population average. This suggests a sustained state of heightened cardiovascular activity. The participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythm displays reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -1.15) and substantially increased intradaily variability (Z-score 1.44), alongside very low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -1.87). These metrics indicate a less consistent and more fragmented daily physiological pattern, which can reflect dysregulation in the biological clock. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations reveals periods of higher-than-average heart rate during typical sleep hours (e.g., 2-3 AM and 6-7 AM, with Z-scores of 1.6 and 2.23 respectively), suggesting physiological activity during times when the body should be in deeper rest, consistent with the noted sleep disturbances. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurring at 4:28 PM, is relatively late compared to typical healthy diurnal patterns.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is substantial and widespread across multiple domains. The participant reports significantly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score 1.52), elevated perceived stress (PSS Z-score 1.19), and below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, moderately negatively correlated with CES-D). Crucially, trait anxiety is above average (STAI Z-score 0.27) with a very strong positive correlation to CES-D (0.82), and self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.31) with a very strong negative correlation to CES-D (-0.71). Physiologically, resting heart rate and MESOR are significantly elevated (Z-scores 1.34 and 1.56, respectively), both weakly positively correlated with CES-D. Sleep patterns are characterized by highly variable sleep start times (Z-score 1.36) and increased napping (Z-score 1.27), both weakly positively correlated with CES-D. The participant also engages in significantly less exercise and more sedentary recreational activities, which, while having weaker correlations, are commonly associated behavioral patterns in individuals with higher depressive symptomatology.

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is limited. The participant's substance usage is consistently low, with Z-scores well below average, and correlations with CES-D are negligible. Academic performance, as indicated by a consistently high GPA, is strong. However, these positive indicators are notably fewer and generally have weaker or non-existent correlations with CES-D compared to the extensive and often strongly correlated indicators of distress.

Considering the comprehensive multimodal data, the convergent findings of significantly disturbed sleep, elevated stress, lower self-esteem and happiness, elevated trait anxiety, elevated physiological arousal, and disrupted circadian rhythms, many of which exhibit strong to moderate correlations with CES-D, strongly suggest an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. Therefore, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden would most likely place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

94641,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits several self-reported psychological characteristics indicative of increased vulnerability to depressive symptoms. Their trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated (Score: 54.0, Z-score: 1.25), placing them significantly above the population mean in chronic anxiety proneness, a factor with a strong positive correlation to CES-D scores (0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem, assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is considerably lower than average (Score: 32.0, Z-score: -0.87), a finding strongly inversely correlated with depressive symptomatology (-0.71). Further suggesting psychological distress, the participant reports lower-than-average satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score: -1.61) and a reduced degree of interpersonal trust (Z-score: -0.78), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Perceived stress is slightly above the population average (Z-score: 0.38), which also positively correlates with CES-D. While self-reported happiness is somewhat above average (Z-score: 0.55), its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46) implies that a higher happiness score would typically be associated with lower depressive symptoms, suggesting the overall profile leans towards elevated psychological distress.

Significant disturbances are evident in the participant's sleep architecture and subjective sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52) indicates clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, reflecting poor sleep quality over the past month. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, which is markedly shorter than the population average (Z-score: -1.15). Moreover, the participant demonstrates high variability in nightly sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 168 minutes, Z-score: 1.52), a factor positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.19). A substantial frequency of daily napping (0.3 naps per day, Z-score: 2.66) further suggests insufficient or inconsistent nocturnal sleep, which is also positively correlated with CES-D (0.19). Regarding circadian rhythms derived from heart rate data, the participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 83.09 BPM, Z-score: 1.25) and resting heart rate (70.3 BPM, Z-score: 1.44) are notably elevated compared to the study population, both metrics showing a positive correlation with CES-D (0.19). These elevated baseline heart rates, coupled with the noted sleep disturbances, point towards a state of increased physiological arousal. Hourly heart rate deviations indicate a typical diurnal pattern with lower rates during sleep and higher rates during wakefulness, peaking in the late afternoon (Acrophase: 4:49 PM). However, the overall elevated baseline heart rate suggests that even ""resting"" levels are higher than average.

The participant's daily activities reveal a notable pattern of social disengagement and sedentary behavior. Socializing with friends is reported at an exceptionally low frequency (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -2.2), signifying marked social withdrawal, a key behavioral correlate often associated with depressive symptoms. Physical activity levels are also notably low across all categories, with ""Not at all"" reported for exercising alone (Z-score: -1.93), exercising with others (Z-score: -1.58), and sports participation (Z-score: -1.09). In contrast, the participant reports extremely high engagement in sedentary hobbies (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 3.19), including a high frequency of video game play (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47) and listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score: 2.06). Substance usage across all categories is reported as ""Not at all"" or very low, which is generally not associated with higher CES-D scores in this context. This constellation of behaviors—pronounced social withdrawal, lack of physical activity, and extensive sedentary pursuits—points towards a lifestyle that may both reflect and contribute to depressive symptomatology.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score:**
The participant reported a slightly above-average level of happiness (Z-score: 0.55), which typically correlates negatively with CES-D scores. Furthermore, their self-reported substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) is consistently at ""Not at all"" or significantly below average, showing negligible or slightly negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting a behavioral pattern not typically associated with increased depressive symptoms. Objectively, wearable heart rate data indicates average interdaily stability and slightly lower intradaily variability, with higher autocorrelation at 24 hours, suggesting a relatively consistent daily rhythm in heart rate, which could be indicative of some degree of physiological regularity.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score:**
A substantial body of evidence points towards an elevated CES-D score. Psychologically, the participant exhibits significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.25, correlation: 0.81) and considerably low self-esteem (Z-score: -0.87, correlation: -0.71), both being strong predictors of higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI Z-score: 1.52), accompanied by objective short sleep duration (Z-score: -1.15) and high variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 1.52, correlation: 0.19), along with frequent napping (Z-score: 2.66, correlation: 0.19)—all patterns often observed in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. Behaviorally, there is pronounced social withdrawal (socializing with friends Z-score: -2.2) and a general lack of physical activity (multiple exercise categories at ""Not at all"" with negative Z-scores), counterbalanced by extensive sedentary hobby engagement (Z-score: 3.19). Physiologically, the participant demonstrates an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.44, correlation: 0.19) and a higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score: 1.25, correlation: 0.19), suggesting a state of heightened physiological arousal that is positively correlated with CES-D scores. Additionally, lower health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.61) and slightly elevated perceived stress (Z-score: 0.38) further align with an increased symptom burden.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that the participant's CES-D score would fall into the top half of the study population distribution. While some minor points suggest average regularity or behavior (e.g., low substance use, consistent HR rhythm), these are significantly outweighed by numerous, highly salient indicators across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains that are strongly associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Specifically, the combination of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep (both subjective and objective), pronounced social withdrawal, lack of physical activity, and elevated physiological arousal (resting HR, mesor) collectively forms a profile highly consistent with elevated depressive symptom burden. The high Z-scores for several key variables (e.g., STAI, PSQI, Sleep Duration SD, Naps, RHR, Mesor, Socializing, Sedentary Hobby) and their correlations with CES-D decisively point towards the upper end of the depressive symptom spectrum within this population.

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by strong academic performance and robust physiological circadian rhythms, juxtaposed with indications of compromised subjective well-being and disturbed sleep. Academically, the participant maintains a consistent 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters, suggesting high cognitive functioning and ability to meet academic demands. Psychologically, self-reported trait anxiety is below the study population average (STAI score 39.0, Z-score -0.23), classifying them as ""not anxious."" However, this is contrasted by slightly below-average self-esteem (RSES score 37.0, Z-score -0.17) and notably below-average self-reported happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53). Perceived stress is slightly above average (PSS score 22.0, Z-score 0.1), and satisfaction with physical health is also below average (score 3.67, Z-score -0.45). Trust levels are slightly above average (score 3.33, Z-score 0.18).

Lifestyle habits indicate a lack of substance use, with ""Not at all"" reported for beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, and non-prescribed drugs, with corresponding negative Z-scores. The participant engages in regular physical activity, exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), both above population averages. However, participation in organized sports is absent (Z-score -1.09). Daily recreational screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage are low (all negative Z-scores), as is time spent listening to music and reading. Socializing with friends is also reported at a lower frequency than average (Z-score -0.62), while time spent on sedentary hobbies is slightly above average (Z-score 0.23). This pattern suggests an active physical lifestyle but potentially reduced engagement in certain social and passive recreational activities.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports disturbed subjective sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0, placing them above the average for sleep disturbance (Z-score 0.13). Objective Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours 59 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.25). Sleep duration exhibits slightly lower variability (standard deviation of 92 minutes, Z-score -0.21), suggesting relatively consistent nightly sleep durations. However, the median sleep start time of 01:05:30 exhibits slightly higher variability (standard deviation of 93 minutes, Z-score 0.21), indicating less consistent bedtimes. The participant does not engage in napping (Z-score -0.86). Collectively, the objective and subjective sleep metrics suggest a pattern of slightly insufficient and somewhat inconsistent sleep, contributing to perceived disturbance.

Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate monitoring reveals a highly regular and robust circadian rhythm. Key parametric measures indicate an above-average MESOR (76.53 bpm, Z-score 0.35) and a significantly high amplitude (15.56, Z-score 1.54), reflecting a pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs at 4:54 PM. Non-parametric measures further support this robust rhythm, with above-average interdaily stability (0.5, Z-score 0.75), below-average intradaily variability (0.47, Z-score -0.53), and significantly high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.45, Z-score 1.06). These metrics collectively demonstrate highly predictable and stable day-to-day heart rate patterns and strong within-day rhythmicity, indicative of well-regulated physiological processes. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above average (60.2 bpm, Z-score 0.24). Hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR highlight a typical pattern of lower heart rate during the night, reaching its nadir around 6-7 AM (-24.17 bpm from MESOR), and a substantial peak in physiological arousal during the late afternoon (5-6 PM), with a deviation of 27.42 bpm above the MESOR, representing a particularly salient and high level of cardiovascular activity during this period (Z-score 2.47). This distinct hourly heart rate pattern reinforces the presence of a strong underlying physiological rhythm.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several factors that typically correlate with lower depressive symptomatology. Notably, their self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score 39.0, Z-score -0.23) is below the population average and classified as ""not anxious,"" with a strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D, suggesting that lower anxiety is associated with lower CES-D. Academically, a consistent 4.0 GPA indicates high functioning and potential resilience. From a physiological standpoint, the participant displays a highly robust and stable circadian rhythm, characterized by above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75), below-average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.53), and significantly elevated amplitude (Z-score 1.54) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06). While the correlations of these objective circadian metrics with CES-D are weak in this dataset, strong physiological regularity is generally considered a protective factor against mood disturbances. Furthermore, consistent engagement in exercise, particularly exercising alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 0.53), alongside abstinence from substance use, generally indicates positive health behaviors associated with better mental well-being.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, several self-reported subjective experiences suggest an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The participant reports below-average self-esteem (RSES score 37.0, Z-score -0.17) which has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is highly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, self-reported happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) is notably below average and shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), further linking lower happiness to higher depressive symptom scores. Subjective sleep quality is also significantly compromised, as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0, classifying it as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and placing it above the population average for sleep disturbance (Z-score 0.13), a well-established symptom of depression. Perceived stress is slightly above average (Z-score 0.1), and satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score -0.45), both of which have negative correlations with CES-D (-0.39 for health satisfaction), suggesting associations with higher depressive symptoms. Objective sleep metrics also show slightly below-average sleep duration (Z-score -0.25) and slightly more variable sleep start times (Z-score 0.21), contributing to a pattern of suboptimal sleep.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a mixed profile. While they maintain strong academic performance, exhibit low anxiety, and demonstrate highly regulated physiological circadian rhythms, the strong indicators from self-report measures of core depressive symptoms such as diminished self-esteem, reduced happiness, and disturbed sleep cannot be overlooked. The correlations provided suggest that even relatively small deviations in self-esteem and happiness have substantial associations with CES-D scores. Despite robust objective physiological regulation, the subjective experience of compromised mood and sleep quality, as captured by the PSQI and direct happiness/self-esteem scales, points more directly towards an increased likelihood of depressive symptomatology. Therefore, weighing the strength of these direct psychological indicators with their correlations, it is more probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents with a complex psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.27, classified as 'anxious') and significantly heightened levels of perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 2.01). This pattern is further supported by below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -0.95). In contrast, the participant reports notably high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.38) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83). While these positive traits, particularly high self-esteem (strong negative correlation with CES-D of -0.71), typically act as protective factors for mental well-being, their co-occurrence with substantial anxiety, very high stress, and reduced happiness (moderate negative correlation with CES-D of -0.46) suggests an intricate internal state where significant distress exists despite robust personal resources.

Sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, is classified as 'Disturbed Sleep,' suggesting subjective difficulties despite the Z-score (-0.33) being slightly below the population mean. Objectively, wearable data shows the participant achieves an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score = 0.56) and maintains relatively stable sleep start times (standard deviation Z-score = -0.44), although the median sleep start is late (00:57:00). However, heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal lower interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.74), suggesting less day-to-day regularity in physiological patterns, and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.32), indicating more fragmentation within daily rhythms. This combination of subjective sleep disturbance and less stable objective physiological rhythms, despite adequate sleep duration, points to an underlying dysregulation that may impact overall well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a very high commitment to physical activity, exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports three times a week or more, with all associated Z-scores exceeding 1.0. This consistent and varied exercise regimen is a significant health-promoting behavior. Substance use is limited to moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.94), with no other substance use reported. Daily recreational habits include above-average engagement in watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 1.28) and average social interaction. Notably, there is very low engagement in internet usage (Z-score = -1.83), listening to music, and reading. Academic performance is consistently strong, with GPAs ranging from 3.52 to 3.72, suggesting effective coping and functioning in the academic domain.

Physiologically, the participant maintains an average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.04) and a slightly below-average overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score = -0.49) with a slightly reduced amplitude (Z-score = -0.44) compared to the population. However, aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveal a pronounced pattern of physiological arousal in the late afternoon. Specifically, heart rate deviations are significantly elevated between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM (Value = 17.12, Z-score = 1.48) and peak dramatically between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM (Value = 24.96, Z-score = 2.4). This period aligns with the participant's acrophase at 4:14 PM, indicating the peak of their heart rate-based circadian rhythm. This sustained and markedly high physiological activity in the late afternoon could reflect significant periods of demanding activity, academic pressure, or heightened stress reactivity.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators suggesting a higher burden of depressive symptomatology, likely placing their CES-D score in the top 50% of the study population. Elevated anxiety, as measured by the STAI (Z-score = 0.27, 'anxious' classification), holds a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. More acutely, perceived stress is extremely high (PSS score = 29.0, Z-score = 2.01), which is a pervasive risk factor for mood disorders. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), as is satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -0.95, correlation = -0.39). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score = 6.0), a common symptom associated with depression. Wearable data shows less regular daily heart rate patterns (lower interdaily stability, Z-score = -0.74) and more fragmented within-day rhythms (higher intradaily variability, Z-score = 0.32), which can be physiological markers of distress. The pronounced peak in physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon (HR deviation Z-score = 2.4) may also reflect a sustained stress response.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest mitigating influences that could contribute to a lower or median CES-D score. The participant reports very high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.38), a trait that has a substantial negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, acting as a powerful protective factor. High levels of interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83) also correlate negatively (-0.41) with CES-D. The participant engages in consistently high levels of physical exercise across multiple categories (all Z-scores > 1.0), which is a well-established buffer against depressive symptoms. Objectively, sleep duration is above average (7 hours 38 minutes, Z-score = 0.56), and sleep start times are relatively stable, indicating a degree of consistency in sleep hygiene. Consistently high academic performance (GPA > 3.5) might also reflect effective coping mechanisms and resilience in certain life domains.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite the presence of significant protective factors, particularly very high self-esteem and extensive physical activity, the overall pattern of the participant's self-reported psychological state points towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The convergence of elevated anxiety, extremely high perceived stress (with the highest Z-score among all reported symptoms), subjective disturbed sleep, and diminished happiness and health satisfaction forms a compelling cluster of indicators strongly associated with depressive symptomatology. While high self-esteem is a powerful counter-indicator, its protective effect appears insufficient to fully negate the broad and intense psychological distress experienced across multiple domains. The strong positive correlation of STAI with CES-D, combined with the participant's 'anxious' classification, carries substantial weight in this assessment. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, the participant's aggregate symptom burden is more likely to place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

44872,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a largely positive self-reported psychological profile, characterized by low trait anxiety (STAI score 39.0, Z-score -0.23), significantly elevated self-esteem (RSES score 43.0, Z-Score 0.68), and notably high self-reported happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64). These measures exhibit strong negative correlations with CES-D scores, suggesting a protective factor against depressive symptomatology. Further supporting a robust psychological state are above-average levels of interpersonal trust (score 3.5, Z-Score 0.5) and high satisfaction with physical health (score 6.0, Z-score 1.3), both also negatively correlated with CES-D. Academic performance remains consistently high across multiple semesters, indicating stable cognitive function and engagement. While perceived stress is slightly above the population average (PSS score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), its positive correlation with CES-D (0.28) is moderate, and other indicators suggest resilience.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in both solitary and social exercise three times a week or more, with Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23 respectively. Social exercise, in particular, shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23). Daily recreational habits indicate low engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV, video games, internet usage, and reading, while socializing with friends for 2-3 hours daily is common (Z-score 0.95). High frequency of alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor 'three times a week or more', Z-scores 1.72, 1.68) is observed, but these behaviors have negligible correlations with CES-D in the study population. The overall pattern suggests an engaged, physically active, and socially connected individual.

Despite these positive indicators, the participant exhibits significant irregularities in their sleep and circadian rhythms, particularly from wearable data. While self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score 6.0, Z-score -0.33) is classified as 'Disturbed Sleep,' it is notably better than the average for the study population. However, objective sleep metrics reveal high variability: sleep duration (standard deviation 135 minutes, Z-score 0.77) and sleep start times (standard deviation 154 minutes, Z-score 1.55) both show greater inconsistency than the average participant. These variances are moderately positively correlated with CES-D scores. Furthermore, circadian rhythm metrics indicate disrupted regularity, with low interdaily stability (0.29, Z-score -0.99) and very low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.16, Z-score -1.37), suggesting a poorly synchronized or irregular daily rhythm, though the direct correlation of these specific metrics with CES-D is minimal.

Physiological data from heart rate further illuminates the participant's activity patterns. The participant exhibits a significantly lower mean heart rate (Mesor 61.84 bpm, Z-score -1.65) and resting heart rate (48.3 bpm, Z-score -1.17) compared to the study population, both of which are positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting lower CES-D is associated with lower heart rates. This indicates good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a robust daily pattern of physiological arousal: substantial peaks in heart rate are observed during typical daytime activity hours (e.g., 10 AM-1 PM, 5-6 PM, with Z-scores up to 3.23), followed by distinct troughs during sleep (e.g., 3-6 AM). This pattern signifies a clear, well-differentiated active phase and rest phase in cardiovascular activity, indicating active engagement during the day and appropriate physiological calming during night hours, despite the variability in sleep timing.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial and widespread across multiple domains. The participant reports low anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23, r=0.81), high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 0.68, r=-0.71), very high happiness (Z-score 1.64, r=-0.46), high trust (Z-score 0.5, r=-0.41), and strong health satisfaction (Z-score 1.3, r=-0.39). All these self-report measures are strongly correlated with CES-D scores in a direction indicative of lower depressive symptomatology. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, which is typically associated with better mental well-being. Behavioral data shows frequent exercise (Z-scores 1.07, 1.23) and high rates of socializing, which are often protective factors against depression. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.17) and mesor (Z-score -1.65) indicate good cardiovascular health, which generally correlates with better mental health, and the positive correlation with CES-D means a lower heart rate is associated with a lower CES-D. The robust pattern of hourly heart rate deviation also suggests a physiologically active and engaged daily life.

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is primarily concentrated in the objective sleep and circadian rhythm metrics. The participant exhibits significantly higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.77, r=0.2) and sleep start times (Z-score 1.55, r=0.23), both of which are positively correlated with CES-D. Furthermore, their circadian rhythm shows lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.99) and very low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.37), suggesting a disregularized rhythm. While the self-reported PSQI score indicates ""disturbed sleep,"" its Z-score (-0.33) is below average for the study population, suggesting that the subjective experience of sleep disturbance is not exceptionally high compared to peers. Perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.38, r=0.28), which could contribute to higher CES-D, but this is a relatively mild deviation.

Holistic analysis indicates that the participant's self-reported psychological well-being, including low anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness, along with strong physical activity and favorable cardiovascular health metrics, are powerful indicators against high depressive symptoms. These positive indicators are numerous and, crucially, show strong correlations with *lower* CES-D scores. While the objective sleep and circadian irregularities are significant and warrant attention, their correlations with CES-D are generally weaker than those of the self-report psychological traits. The discrepancy between moderately higher perceived stress and strong positive psychological states is resolved by the strong negative correlations of the latter with CES-D. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence, particularly from strongly correlated psychological trait measures, strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
27306,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a profile generally indicative of strong psychological resources and healthy lifestyle habits, which typically act as protective factors against depressive symptoms. Self-report measures show notably low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43, classified as ""not anxious""), and exceptionally high self-esteem (RSES Z-Score 1.66). These traits are significantly correlated with lower CES-D scores (STAI: 0.81, Self-Esteem: -0.71). Additionally, the participant reports above-average interpersonal trust (Z-Score 1.15) and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.8), both of which are moderately associated with lower depressive symptomatology (Trust: -0.41, Health Satisfaction: -0.39). Perceived stress levels are average (PSS Z-Score -0.17), while current happiness is slightly below the population mean (Z-Score -0.53), a factor moderately correlated with higher CES-D scores (-0.46). Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, has shown improvement and consistency across semesters.

Regarding sleep and physiological rhythms, the participant reports excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI Score 4.0, Z-Score -1.26, classified as ""Good Sleep""). Objectively measured sleep from wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-Score -0.6), but with greater consistency in both duration and start time than the average participant (Sleep Duration Standard Deviation Z-Score -0.37, Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-Score -0.57). Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a notably low Mesor (63.03, Z-Score -1.49) and Resting Heart Rate (46.2, Z-Score -1.42), suggesting a well-conditioned cardiovascular system. The circadian amplitude is slightly above average (Z-Score 0.46), indicating a pronounced difference between daily peak and trough heart rates. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability are near average, suggesting typical regularity in daily heart rate patterns.

Behavioral habits further underscore a highly active and disciplined lifestyle. The participant reports very low engagement in substance use across all categories (e.g., Beer Usage Z-Score -0.41, Recreational Drugs Z-Score -0.31). Exercise habits are significantly above average, with the participant exercising alone and with others ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-Scores 1.07 and 1.23, respectively), while reporting no engagement in sports (Z-Score -1.09). Daily recreational activities typically involving sedentary behavior, such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, reading, and general sedentary hobbies, are largely reported as ""Do not do"" or with very minimal time investment (e.g., Internet Usage ""15 minutes or less"", Z-Score -1.83). Socializing with friends is reported at 31 minutes per hour, which is slightly below the average (Z-Score -0.62). These patterns suggest a preference for active pursuits over sedentary leisure, potentially contributing to the low observed resting heart rate. The participant's Body Mass Index of 17.11 is at the lower end of the healthy range, indicating a lean physique.

The analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct and pronounced physiological activity patterns. During nighttime hours (12 AM - 6 AM), heart rate values are substantially below the mesor, with Z-scores as low as -2.45 to -2.08, indicating profound periods of rest. A sharp and significant surge in heart rate occurs in the early morning (7 AM - 8 AM), reaching an extremely high deviation from the mesor (Value 34.91, Z-Score 5.17), followed by a gradual decrease. A notable dip in heart rate below the mesor is observed in the mid-day period (12 PM - 2 PM), with Z-scores around -2.61, suggesting a quiescent phase. This is then followed by another intensely active period in the late afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM), with an exceptional peak between 4 PM and 5 PM (Value 61.42, Z-Score 7.8). Heart rate then progressively declines into the late evening and night. This biphasic pattern, characterized by extraordinary peaks of physiological arousal during typical activity times and pronounced troughs during rest, indicates an individual with periods of exceptionally high energy expenditure and activity levels that significantly exceed the study population average.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits a substantial number of psychological traits and behavioral patterns that are strongly associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Notably, their self-esteem is exceptionally high (Z-Score 1.66) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). Trait anxiety is low (Z-score -0.43) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (correlation 0.81, meaning lower anxiety is linked to lower CES-D). Subjective sleep quality is reported as very good (PSQI Z-Score -1.26), and health satisfaction is high (Z-score 1.8), both protective factors. The participant engages in significantly more physical exercise than peers, both alone and with others (Z-Scores 1.07 and 1.23, respectively), a behavior generally linked to improved mood and reduced depressive symptoms. Substance use is extremely low across all categories. The low resting heart rate and mesor suggest good cardiovascular fitness, which is typically a marker of overall health. Furthermore, consistent academic performance indicates functional adaptation within the university environment.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting an elevated CES-D score is considerably less prominent. The participant's reported current happiness is slightly below average (Z-Score -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46, indicating lower happiness correlates with higher CES-D). While the participant reports limited engagement in a range of common sedentary recreational activities (e.g., TV, internet use, reading), and slightly less socializing with friends, the provided correlations for these specific activities with CES-D are generally weak or even slightly positive (meaning less engagement correlates with *lower* CES-D). The Body Mass Index of 17.11 is low and might warrant clinical attention, but no direct correlation with CES-D is provided to suggest it is indicative of higher depressive symptoms in this context.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the multimodal data, the overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a lower burden of depressive symptoms. The strong protective factors, including very high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, good subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, and robust exercise habits, are key indicators. While slightly lower current happiness and limited engagement in certain recreational activities are noted, these are largely offset by the strength of the protective psychological and behavioral factors. The extreme physiological activity peaks observed in the hourly heart rate data suggest a highly active individual rather than one experiencing the psychomotor retardation or anhedonia often associated with significant depressive symptoms, even if these activities are not categorized as traditional ""leisure."" Therefore, the participant's overall profile is more consistent with an individual experiencing relatively low or average depressive symptomatology within the study population.

46365,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a complex psychological and physiological profile that exhibits both strengths and areas of potential concern when evaluating depressive symptoms. Psychologically, the participant reports slightly above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.37) and exhibits lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score = -1.45). These indicators suggest a degree of internal distress. However, this is counterbalanced by above-average self-esteem (Z-score = 0.26), below-average perceived stress (Z-score = -0.44), and consistent excellent academic performance (GPA 4.0). A moderately lower-than-average trust score (Z-score = -0.46) is also noted, potentially indicating social apprehension.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant subjectively reports good sleep quality as indicated by a PSQI score of 5 (Z-score = -0.8), placing them better than average within the study population. Objectively, wearable data reveals an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score = 0.11), but a notably late median sleep start time of 01:34:00. There is relatively low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score = -0.23) and sleep start time (Z-score = -0.47), suggesting a consistent but delayed sleep schedule. Moreover, the participant engages in significantly more frequent napping than the average (Z-score = 1.09). This discrepancy between subjective good sleep and objective indicators of a delayed, napping-prone schedule suggests a potentially less restorative or dysregulated sleep-wake cycle.

Circadian rhythmicity, as derived from heart rate data, appears less robust than average. Interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.9) is below average, indicating less day-to-day regularity in activity. Intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.31) is significantly low, suggesting a less dynamic or flatter physiological profile within a typical day. Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -1.37) is also notably low, further pointing to a weaker 24-hour rhythm. The Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly above average (Z-score = 0.43), while the amplitude is average. The acrophase, representing the peak physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 6:09 PM, which is a delayed timing compared to typical healthy patterns. Despite these less regular rhythms, the participant's resting heart rate (55.8 bpm, Z-score = -0.28) is slightly below the population average, indicating good underlying cardiovascular fitness.

A detailed examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinctive pattern of physiological arousal. During the late evening and early morning hours (10:00 PM to 1:00 AM), heart rate is markedly elevated, averaging 10-15 bpm above the Mesor (approximately 87-92 bpm). This is a substantial increase, 30-37 bpm higher than the participant's resting heart rate, suggesting significant physiological arousal during a period typically dedicated to rest and sleep preparation. Conversely, the early morning hours (6:00 AM to 8:00 AM) show significantly negative heart rate deviations, placing the average heart rate at or even slightly below the participant's resting heart rate (approximately 54-56 bpm). This prolonged period of very low physiological activity post-awakening implies a delayed onset of daily engagement and activity following the late-night arousal. This pattern indicates a notable misalignment in daily physiological arousal, with elevated activity persisting late into the night and a subdued, delayed morning activation.

Behavioral habits include significantly high beer consumption (Z-score = 1.72) and robust social engagement, as evidenced by more than 4 hours of socializing with friends (Z-score = 2.53). The participant also engages in higher-than-average sports activity (Z-score = 0.91) but reports less frequent general exercise. Recreationally, internet usage is notably high (more than 4 hours, Z-score = 2.19), while engagement in other common sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, or reading is reported as absent or very low. This suggests a pattern of active social and online engagement alongside sports, but a preference away from other common passive leisure activities.

In synthesis, the participant presents with several indicators that point towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. Specifically, self-reported trait anxiety, lower happiness, and significantly reduced health satisfaction align with patterns often seen in individuals with higher CES-D scores. The physiological data provides strong corroborating evidence: the profound late-night physiological arousal, a delayed acrophase, generally less robust circadian rhythms, and increased napping collectively suggest significant sleep-wake and autonomic dysregulation. Furthermore, significantly high internet usage, which positively correlates with CES-D scores, is also present. These factors collectively appear to outweigh the protective elements, such as high self-esteem, low perceived stress, excellent academic performance, and high social engagement, making a higher overall depressive symptom burden more likely.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Based on the multimodal data analysis, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

Evidence supporting a relatively high CES-D score (top 50%):
*   **Self-Reported Anxiety (STAI):** The participant's STAI score (Z-score = 0.37, classified as anxious) has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, indicating that higher anxiety is associated with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Low Happiness:** The participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53), which correlates negatively (-0.46) with CES-D, meaning lower happiness is associated with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Low Health Satisfaction:** A significantly low self-reported satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -1.45) correlates negatively (-0.39) with CES-D, suggesting lower health satisfaction is associated with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Low Interpersonal Trust:** Below-average trust (Z-score = -0.46) correlates negatively (-0.41) with CES-D, linking lower trust to higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Increased Internet Usage:** The participant's significantly high internet usage (Z-score = 2.19) has a positive correlation (0.26) with CES-D.
*   **Physiological Arousal:** The distinct pattern of significantly elevated heart rate during late evening and early morning hours (10 PM to 1 AM, ~30-37 bpm above resting HR), indicative of physiological stress and dysregulation, is a strong marker often associated with affective distress.
*   **Elevated Mesor (Mean Heart Rate):** The slightly above-average Mesor (Z-score = 0.43) correlates positively (0.19) with CES-D.
*   **Increased Napping:** Significantly more frequent napping (Z-score = 1.09) correlates positively (0.21) with CES-D.
*   **Circadian Irregularity:** Below-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -0.9) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score = -1.37) suggest less robust daily rhythms, which can be associated with depressive symptoms.
*   **Sleep Start Time Variability:** While the participant has *less* variability in sleep start time (Z=-0.47), this specific metric correlates positively with CES-D (0.22), meaning less variability is associated with higher CES-D. A similar pattern is seen for sleep duration variability (Z=-0.23, correlation 0.2).

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):
*   **High Self-Esteem:** The participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score = 0.26), which has a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, suggesting higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms.
*   **Good Academic Performance:** Consistent 4.0 GPA indicates strong academic functioning.
*   **Low Perceived Stress:** Below-average perceived stress (Z-score = -0.44) correlates positively (0.28) with CES-D, meaning lower stress is associated with lower depressive symptoms.
*   **Subjective Sleep Quality (PSQI):** A PSQI score of 5 (Z-score = -0.8) indicates better-than-average subjective sleep quality within the population, despite being borderline for clinical significance.
*   **Good Resting Heart Rate:** A slightly below-average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.28) correlates positively (0.19) with CES-D, suggesting lower RHR is associated with lower depressive symptoms.
*   **High Socializing and Sports Participation:** These activities typically correlate with lower depressive symptoms, though their direct correlations with CES-D were weak or slightly negative in this dataset.

Holistic Analysis: While the participant exhibits significant protective factors such as high self-esteem, excellent academic performance, and low perceived stress, the cumulative evidence from other domains strongly points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The strong correlations of trait anxiety, low happiness, and notably low health satisfaction with higher CES-D scores are significant. Critically, the objective physiological data reveals substantial dysregulation, including pronounced late-night physiological arousal, a delayed acrophase, and generally less robust circadian rhythms. These physiological disruptions, coupled with increased napping and high internet usage (which correlates positively with CES-D), collectively suggest a higher level of internal distress and symptom burden that outweighs the protective factors. Therefore, despite some areas of resilience and good functioning, the participant's overall profile aligns more closely with characteristics observed in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms.

The participant presents a psychological profile characterized by generally low anxiety and stress levels. Their self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI–Trait scale, is below the population average (Score 37.0, Z-score -0.43) and categorized as 'not anxious'. This is a significant finding, given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Similarly, perceived stress (Score 18.0, Z-score -0.98) is also notably below the population mean. The participant reports significantly higher satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.71) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83). While self-esteem is average (Z-score -0.03), current happiness (Z-score -0.53) is slightly below the population average, an indicator that typically shows a moderate negative correlation with depressive symptomatology. Collectively, these self-reported psychological measures suggest a resilient profile with several protective factors against depressive symptoms.

Objective and subjective sleep data largely align, indicating good sleep health. The participant's subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is notably superior to the population average (Score 3.0, Z-score -1.72), categorized as ""Good Sleep."" This self-report is supported by Fitbit-derived data showing a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 23 minutes, which is significantly longer than the typical duration in the study population (Z-score 1.49). Sleep start times exhibit average regularity (Z-score -0.15). However, there is slightly higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.67) and a significantly higher frequency of napping (Z-score 2.07) compared to peers. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a significantly lower-than-average resting heart rate (40.6 bpm, Z-score -2.09) and MESOR (57.82, Z-score -2.2). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data, including Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.33) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.17), are within average ranges, indicating a stable and robust daily physiological rhythm. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly above average (Z-score 0.56), suggesting a healthy range of physiological activation and deactivation throughout the day.

Behavioral patterns reveal a combination of healthy habits and some areas of potential deviation from population norms. The participant consistently reports abstaining from substance use, with Z-scores notably below average across all categories, indicating a very low risk profile in this domain. Exercise habits are generally positive, particularly engagement in ""Exercising with Others"" which occurs ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.23). While recreational screen time (e.g., watching TV/Videos/Movies, Video Games) is significantly lower than average, internet usage is notably high (""3-4 hours,"" Z-score 1.52). Furthermore, time spent socializing with friends is significantly less than the population average (""16-30 minutes,"" Z-score -1.41). Hourly heart rate data indicates physiological patterns consistent with typical activity during the day and rest at night. However, there are pronounced and significantly elevated heart rate deviations from the MESOR during the late evening hours (9-11 PM, Z-scores up to 2.37), suggesting periods of heightened physiological arousal or activity during times typically associated with winding down. This elevated late-night activity, combined with higher internet usage and reduced social interaction, constitutes a noteworthy pattern that warrants consideration.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators suggesting a relatively low or median depressive symptom burden. Notably, their STAI-Trait score is significantly below average (Z-score -0.43) and classified as 'not anxious', which is strongly (correlation 0.81) linked to lower CES-D scores. Subjective sleep quality, measured by the PSQI, is markedly better than average (Z-score -1.72), a factor consistently associated with better mental health outcomes. The participant also reports lower-than-average perceived stress (Z-score -0.98), higher satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.71, correlated negatively with CES-D), and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83, correlated negatively with CES-D). Physiologically, a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score -2.09) and MESOR (Z-score -2.2) suggest excellent cardiovascular fitness, which typically correlates with improved overall well-being. Furthermore, positive lifestyle choices such as very low substance use and consistent exercise, particularly with others, generally serve as protective factors against depressive symptoms. The longer median sleep duration (8h 23m, Z-score 1.49), while potentially indicative of hypersomnia in some cases, is presented alongside good subjective sleep quality.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, a few aspects of the data could be interpreted as potentially leaning towards a higher depressive symptom burden, although these indicators are generally less pronounced or have weaker correlations with CES-D. The participant's reported current happiness is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) with CES-D. Behavioral data shows significantly less socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) and significantly higher internet usage (Z-score 1.52), though these activities have very low to low correlations with CES-D (socializing: -0.02, internet usage: 0.26). Fitbit data indicates a significantly higher frequency of napping (Z-score 2.07) and slightly greater variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.67), both with low positive correlations with CES-D (0.22 and 0.2, respectively). Lastly, the hourly heart rate data shows pronounced, significantly elevated physiological arousal or activity during late evening hours (9-11 PM, Z-scores up to 2.37) when compared to the population, which could potentially interfere with restorative processes or indicate less adaptive late-night behaviors.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence for a lower or median CES-D score is substantially stronger and more consistently supported by highly salient features and strong correlations. The participant demonstrates a robust profile of mental well-being, characterized by low anxiety and stress, excellent subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, and superior cardiovascular health. These protective factors, especially low anxiety and good sleep quality, are highly indicative and represent significant deviations from the population mean in a positive direction. While aspects like slightly reduced happiness, lower social engagement, higher internet use, and elevated late-night physiological activity are noted, their associations with CES-D are either weaker or less impactful in magnitude compared to the overwhelming evidence pointing towards lower depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is more likely to fall within the lower half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits notably elevated trait anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 61.0 (Z-score 1.95), which classifies them as anxious and demonstrates a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is lower than average (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 31.0, Z-score -1.01), a factor strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Perceived stress is slightly elevated (Perceived Stress Scale score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), aligning with higher CES-D scores (correlation 0.28). Furthermore, the participant reports lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1) and lower satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -1.03), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D, suggesting these factors tend to co-occur with elevated depressive symptomatology. While the participant reports slightly higher current happiness (Z-score 0.55), its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46) suggests that higher happiness is generally associated with lower depressive symptoms, potentially indicating a complex interplay or specific coping mechanisms for this individual.

Sleep quality is subjectively reported as disturbed (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score 8.0, Z-score 0.59). Objective Fitbit data corroborates significant sleep irregularities, including a notably short median sleep duration of 6 hours 26 minutes (Z-score -0.94) and substantial variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.4). Most strikingly, the participant exhibits extremely high variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 208 minutes, Z-score 2.74), which is strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.2). Physiologically, the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm demonstrates significantly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -1.48) and amplitude (Z-score -1.61), alongside higher intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51). These metrics collectively indicate a less regular, flatter, and more fragmented physiological rhythm, consistent with disturbed sleep-wake patterns and potentially reflecting broader neurophysiological dysregulation.

Behaviorally, the participant reports very low engagement in physical exercise, both alone (Z-score -1.18) and with others (Z-score -1.58), which is weakly but negatively correlated with CES-D, indicating that reduced activity is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Daily recreational habits reveal a marked avoidance of screen-based activities such as TV/videos (Z-score -1.25), video games (Z-score -0.56), and internet usage (Z-score -1.83). In contrast, the participant reports exceptionally high engagement in listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53). Notably, the high music listening is positively correlated with CES-D (0.25), suggesting it may not serve as a purely ameliorative activity in this context. While socializing is very high, its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.02). From a physiological perspective, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows periods of lower physiological arousal compared to the population average during typical daytime hours, specifically from 11 AM-12 PM (Z-score -1.33), 2-3 PM (Z-score -1.56), and 4-5 PM (Z-score -1.19). Combined with a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.48), these patterns might suggest underlying physiological stress coupled with reduced daily energy expenditure or engagement.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The participant's data presents substantial evidence suggesting a high CES-D score. Critically, the STAI score for trait anxiety is exceptionally high (Z-score 1.95) and demonstrates a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), indicating a pronounced predisposition to anxiety that frequently co-occurs with depressive symptoms. Similarly, self-esteem is notably low (Z-score -1.01) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), a key psychological vulnerability associated with depression. Elevated perceived stress (Z-score 0.38, correlation 0.28), lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1, correlation -0.41), and reduced health satisfaction (Z-score -1.03, correlation -0.39) further align with higher CES-D scores. Objectively, sleep patterns are highly disrupted, with an extremely high variability in sleep start times (Z-score 2.74), which shows a significant positive correlation with CES-D (0.2). This severe sleep irregularity, coupled with disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score 0.59) and shorter median sleep duration, strongly points to sleep disturbances often seen in depression. Physiologically, the blunted amplitude (Z-score -1.61) and reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -1.48) of the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm, along with observed periods of lower physiological arousal during typical daytime hours, suggest a pervasive dysregulation consistent with depressive states. Finally, exceptionally low engagement in physical exercise (e.g., Z-scores -1.18 to -1.58) and the positive correlation between high music listening and CES-D (0.25) further contribute to this pattern.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
The primary evidence that might suggest a lower or median CES-D score is the participant's slightly higher self-reported current happiness (Z-score 0.55), which has a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), implying higher happiness generally aligns with lower depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant reports very high engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53), although its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.02). The participant also demonstrates strong academic performance (GPAs ranging from 3.5 to 3.92), suggesting some level of functional capacity. Substance usage is generally low or typical, with weak correlations to CES-D. The median heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.15) is typical, and its correlation with CES-D is weak (0.19).

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the totality of the data, the evidence strongly weighs towards a high CES-D score. The psychological traits (STAI, Self-Esteem, Stress, Trust, Health Satisfaction) show a consistent pattern of indicators highly correlated with increased depressive symptomatology. The objective sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions, particularly the extreme variability in sleep start times, are profound and directly linked to higher CES-D. While high current happiness and social engagement are present, the strong, consistent, and highly correlated indicators of anxiety, low self-esteem, and severe sleep dysregulation are more robust predictors of depressive burden. The presence of periods of reduced physiological arousal during typical daytime hours further supports a potential reduction in energy and engagement. Therefore, despite some counter-indicators, the overall pattern of evidence is highly suggestive of an elevated depressive symptom burden.

The participant presents with a psychological profile indicative of relatively low trait anxiety and high self-esteem. Their STAI-Trait score (33.0, Z-score: -0.82) is notably below the population average, classifying them as ""not anxious,"" which is a strong protective factor against depressive symptoms given its significant positive correlation with the CES-D score (0.81). Similarly, the participant's self-esteem (39.0, Z-score: 0.11) is slightly above the population mean and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Perceived stress (21.0, Z-score: -0.17) is also slightly below average. Conversely, the participant reports current happiness (3.0, Z-score: -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (3.33, Z-score: -0.70) that are moderately below the population average. These lower scores, especially for happiness, align with a negative correlation to CES-D (-0.46 for happiness, -0.39 for health satisfaction), suggesting areas of potential subjective distress despite the overall low trait anxiety and high self-esteem. The participant also demonstrates above-average interpersonal trust (3.67, Z-score: 0.83), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41), further suggesting a robust social-emotional disposition. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA across semesters, indicating consistent academic performance.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI score of 5.0 (Z-score: -0.80), placing them below the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance and significantly better than the study average. Wearable data corroborates some aspects of healthy sleep, showing an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes (Z-score: 0.47) and relatively low variability in both sleep duration (85 minutes, Z-score: -0.36) and sleep start time (68 minutes, Z-score: -0.32). These consistent sleep patterns, especially the low variability, are generally associated with better mental health outcomes. However, the participant reports an above-average frequency of daily naps (0.13, Z-score: 0.70), which shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.21), potentially indicating some residual sleep debt or daytime fatigue despite otherwise good sleep metrics. The median sleep start time is 00:29:45, suggesting a moderately late sleep schedule.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal a generally stable and robust circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.47, Z-score: 0.50) is above average, indicating consistent day-to-day patterns in physiological activity. Intradaily Variability (0.55, Z-score: 0.03) is average, and the rhythm's amplitude (12.52, Z-score: 0.56) is above average, suggesting a well-defined and strong daily rhythm in heart rate, with a distinct difference between active and rest periods. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs at 4:00 PM, which is a typical time for peak alertness or activity. The participant's resting heart rate (56.4 bpm, Z-score: -0.21) is slightly below the population average, indicating good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor (72.0, Z-score: -0.27) illustrates a clear pattern: significant reductions in heart rate during early morning hours (e.g., -22.45 bpm from 3-5 AM), consistent with deep sleep. Heart rate steadily increases through the morning, peaking in the late afternoon/early evening with notable elevations (e.g., 15.05 bpm above mesor from 3-4 PM, and a significant 25.34 bpm above mesor from 6-7 PM, Z-score: 2.22). This pronounced peak in the evening suggests periods of high physiological arousal or activity, followed by a gradual decline into the night.

Behavioral habits further contextualize the participant's lifestyle. Substance usage is minimal, with beer consumption reported as ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Z-score: -0.41) and recreational/non-prescribed drug use reported as ""Not at all."" The participant engages in exercise alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.32), which is slightly above average, but rarely exercises with others or participates in sports. Daily recreational habits indicate low engagement with digital media, such as watching TV/videos (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.62) and internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.16), and reports ""Do not do"" for video games and listening to music (Z-score: -1.19). Socializing with friends is reported at 31 minutes per hour (Z-score: -0.62), suggesting less time spent on this activity compared to the average. Reading is reported at 15 minutes or less (Z-score: 0.32), which is slightly above average for engagement. Overall, the participant exhibits a profile of low substance use, moderate solitary exercise, and relatively low engagement in various common recreational activities, particularly those involving digital media or passive entertainment.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators consistent with a lower burden of depressive symptoms. Their STAI-Trait score is significantly low (Z-score -0.82), indicating low trait anxiety, which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). This suggests a foundational resilience to anxiety-related distress often comorbid with depression. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is excellent (Z-score -0.80), directly contradicting a common symptom of depression. Furthermore, the participant's self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), serving as another protective factor. Lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.17) and higher interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83), both correlated in expected directions, also lean towards lower CES-D. Physiologically, stable sleep duration (Z-score -0.36) and consistent sleep start times (Z-score -0.32), combined with high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.50) and amplitude (Z-score 0.56) in their heart rate circadian rhythm, suggest strong physiological regulation typically associated with better mental well-being. Their resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.21), which is also typically associated with better cardiovascular health and potentially lower stress.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Some aspects of the participant's profile suggest potential areas of subjective distress, which could elevate depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.70) are both moderately below the population average. Both metrics show a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively), implying that lower scores here might contribute to higher depressive symptom burden. Additionally, the participant reports an above-average frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.70), which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.21), possibly indicating issues with daytime energy or sleep quality not fully captured by other sleep metrics. Their relatively low engagement in various recreational activities, particularly social ones, could also be a subtle indicator, though the correlations with CES-D for these specific activities are generally weak or negligible.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are some indications of lower subjective happiness and health satisfaction, the preponderant evidence points towards a lower overall burden of depressive symptoms. The significant protective factors, particularly the very low trait anxiety, good subjective sleep quality, and above-average self-esteem, carry substantial weight given their strong correlation with CES-D scores. The robust and stable circadian rhythm further supports a well-regulated physiological state. The areas of concern (lower happiness and health satisfaction, increased napping) are less pronounced in their Z-scores or have weaker correlations with CES-D compared to the strong protective factors. Therefore, the participant's overall profile aligns more closely with individuals experiencing relatively low or average depressive symptomatology.

The participant presents with a complex profile, exhibiting a combination of traits and behaviors that suggest both resilience and potential vulnerabilities concerning depressive symptoms. Self-report measures indicate an above-average level of self-esteem (Z=0.68) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0, Z=-0.8), factors typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Additionally, the participant reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z=0.38) and interpersonal trust (Z=0.18), both of which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Academically, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA, further indicating a degree of functional competence.

However, several other self-report and objective metrics suggest potential areas of concern. The participant reports below-average happiness (Z=-0.53) and above-average perceived stress (Z=0.92). While the STAI score for anxiety is near the population average (Z=0.07), its classification as ""anxious"" combined with a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) suggests that even average anxiety levels in this population may be linked to depressive symptom burden. Behaviorally, the participant engages significantly less in physical exercise across all categories (Z-scores ranging from -1.18 to -1.58), indicating a highly sedentary lifestyle. Conversely, leisure activities include notably more video gaming (Z=2.47), above-average internet usage (Z=0.85), and above-average listening to music (Z=1.13), with internet usage and music listening showing moderate positive correlations with CES-D. This pattern of reduced physical activity coupled with increased sedentary screen-based recreation points towards a less active and potentially more isolated lifestyle. Objectively, sleep data from wearables indicate shorter than average median sleep duration (6 hours 48 minutes, Z=-0.47) but with very high consistency in sleep duration (Z=-0.89 for standard deviation).

Physiologically, the wearable data reveals a pattern of generally elevated cardiovascular activity. The participant's Mesor (mean heart rate, Z=0.61) and Resting Heart Rate (Z=0.86) are both above the population average and show weak positive correlations with CES-D. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor further supports this, showing relatively less decrease in heart rate during typical sleep hours and more pronounced increases during waking hours compared to the study population's average daily rhythm, indicative of heightened physiological arousal across the 24-hour cycle. Despite this elevated physiological state, circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Z=0.42) and particularly 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=1.15), suggest a highly regular and structured heart rate-based daily rhythm, which could reflect a stable routine.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a relatively low or average CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile, i.e., <= 11.5) includes the participant's significantly above-average self-esteem (Z=0.68) with a strong negative correlation to CES-D (-0.71), indicating a powerful protective factor. Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z=-0.8), higher health satisfaction (Z=0.38), and above-average interpersonal trust (Z=0.18), all moderately negatively correlated with CES-D. High academic performance and consistent sleep patterns also suggest areas of adaptive functioning.

Conversely, significant evidence points towards a relatively high CES-D score (top 50th percentile, i.e., > 11.5). The participant reports below-average happiness (Z=-0.53, moderately negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.46) and above-average perceived stress (Z=0.92, weakly positively correlated at 0.28). While the STAI score is average (Z=0.07), its ""anxious"" classification and strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) suggests a baseline anxiety that may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a notably sedentary lifestyle with significantly less physical exercise (Z-scores for exercise habits are very negative) and increased engagement in sedentary screen-based activities such as video gaming, internet usage (Z=0.85), and music listening (Z=1.13), with the latter two having moderate positive correlations with CES-D (0.25). Physiologically, the participant displays elevated overall cardiovascular activity, including a higher Mesor (Z=0.61) and Resting Heart Rate (Z=0.86), both weakly positively correlated with CES-D. The consistent pattern of higher heart rate across the 24-hour cycle, indicating elevated physiological arousal, further aligns with potential stress and depressive symptom burden.

Holistically, while the participant benefits from high self-esteem and good subjective sleep quality, the cumulative weight of other factors tips the balance towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The combination of lower happiness, higher perceived stress, a self-reported ""anxious"" disposition (despite an average STAI score, given its strong correlation), a significantly sedentary lifestyle with increased screen time (which correlates positively with CES-D), and objective markers of chronic physiological arousal suggests that the participant likely experiences a symptom load that places them in the upper half of the study population's CES-D distribution.

67918,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile presents a complex but predominantly adaptive pattern across multiple domains. Self-report data indicate notably low levels of trait anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI score of 35.0 (Z-score -0.62), classifying them as ""not anxious."" This is a significant finding, given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D scores in the study population. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem, with an RSES score of 48.0 (Z-Score 1.38), which also exhibits a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D. These two factors are substantial indicators of resilience against depressive symptomatology. Further reinforcing a positive mental health profile, the participant reports excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 3.0, Z-Score -1.72, classified as ""Good Sleep"") and high overall satisfaction with their physical health (Score 5.89, Z-score 1.22), the latter having a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39). While current self-reported happiness is lower than average (Score 3.0, Z-Score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), this is largely counterbalanced by other robust indicators of well-being. Perceived stress levels are average (PSS score 21.0, Z-Score -0.17), with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. Lifestyle behaviors are generally healthy, characterized by a complete absence of substance use, though exercise frequency is lower than average, with ""1-2 times a month"" for both exercising alone and with others. Academic performance is strong, indicated by consistent high GPAs.

Objective wearable data reveal a highly structured and stable physiological profile. The participant demonstrates exceptional sleep patterns, with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 42 minutes (Z-Score 1.88), significantly exceeding the population average. This lengthy sleep duration is coupled with notable consistency, as indicated by lower-than-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (74 minutes, Z-Score -0.6) and sleep start time (55 minutes, Z-Score -0.6), and a reported absence of napping. These robust and consistent sleep habits align with generally favorable mental health outcomes. Furthermore, circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data underscore this stability: interdaily stability (Z-Score 1.49) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-Score 1.65) are both notably high, while intraday variability (Z-Score -1.24) is low. These metrics collectively indicate a highly regular and consolidated physiological rhythm, suggesting a well-entrained biological clock. The heart rate mesor (81.27, Z-Score 1.0) and resting heart rate (62.8, Z-Score 0.55) are slightly above the population average, and both show weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear diurnal pattern, with pronounced troughs during typical sleep hours and significant peaks during the active daytime, particularly between 1 PM and 3 PM, where deviations reach Z-scores of 1.95 and 2.34. This strong amplitude (Z-Score 1.59) in daily heart rate fluctuation suggests healthy physiological responsiveness and recovery, despite a slightly elevated overall heart rate.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a relatively low or median CES-D score (bottom 50% of the study population) is robust and multi-faceted. The participant's self-reported low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62) and high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 1.38) are critically important, given their strong negative correlations with CES-D (-0.81 and -0.71, respectively). These are the most influential psychological indicators, suggesting a lower depressive symptom burden. Complementing this, excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.72) and objectively measured significantly long (Z-score 1.88) and highly consistent sleep duration and timing from Fitbit data provide strong physiological evidence for well-being. The participant also reports high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), and maintains a lifestyle free of substance use. Furthermore, highly regular and stable physiological circadian rhythms, indicated by high interdaily stability, low intraday variability, high autocorrelation, and high amplitude, are generally associated with better mental health outcomes, even if their direct correlation with CES-D in this dataset is negligible.

Evidence suggesting a higher CES-D score (top 50% of the study population) is comparatively weaker. The primary indicator is lower self-reported current happiness (Z-score -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). Additionally, the participant's exercise frequency is below average, and while its correlation with CES-D is weak, reduced physical activity can sometimes align with elevated depressive symptoms. Slightly elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.0) and resting heart rate (RHR Z-score 0.55) are also weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). However, the magnitude of these correlations and the Z-scores themselves are considerably less pronounced than the strong protective factors identified.

Holistic analysis indicates that the preponderance of evidence strongly points towards a low or average depressive symptom burden. The substantial protective effects stemming from low anxiety, high self-esteem, excellent sleep quality and consistency, robust circadian rhythms, and high health satisfaction significantly outweigh the less impactful indicators of lower happiness, slightly elevated heart rate metrics, and infrequent exercise. The strength of the inverse correlations for STAI and Self-Esteem with CES-D is particularly compelling. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the lower half of the study population's distribution.

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile indicates a robust level of emotional well-being and adaptive coping mechanisms. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (Z-score = -0.82), classifying the participant as ""not anxious."" This low anxiety score is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms, given its high positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Similarly, self-esteem is higher than the population average (Z-score = 0.26), exhibiting a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), indicating a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Reported happiness is significantly elevated (Z-score = 1.64), also negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Satisfaction with physical health is above average (Z-score = 0.8) and negatively associated with depressive symptomatology (-0.39). Perceived stress levels are within the average range (Z-score = 0.1), and academic performance, as indicated by consistently high GPAs, suggests effective functioning. The participant reports no substance usage across all categories, which is generally not associated with increased depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant engages in frequent exercise, particularly with others (Z-score = 1.23, three times a week or more), a behavior moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23), suggesting a protective influence on mental health. Engagement in other daily recreational activities is generally lower than average, though correlations with CES-D are mixed and weak. Overall, these psychological and lifestyle factors present a profile that is largely protective against elevated depressive symptoms.

Despite the generally positive psychological and behavioral profile, the participant exhibits significant sleep disturbances. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), is notably poor (score = 8.0, Z-score = 0.59), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep"" due to a score exceeding the clinical threshold of 5. Objectively, wearable data reveal considerable irregularity in sleep patterns. While median sleep duration is slightly longer than average (7 hours 24 minutes, Z-score = 0.28), both the standard deviation of sleep duration (128 minutes, Z-score = 0.61) and, more notably, the standard deviation of sleep start time (134 minutes, Z-score = 1.12) are significantly elevated. This indicates substantial variability in the participant's nightly sleep schedule. Additionally, the frequency of daily naps is higher than average (Z-score = 0.61). These metrics, particularly the high variability in sleep timing and increased napping, are positively correlated with CES-D (ranging from 0.20 to 0.22), suggesting an association with increased depressive symptoms. The confluence of poor subjective sleep quality and objective sleep irregularity points to a significant area of concern for sleep health.

Analysis of heart rate data reveals a complex pattern concerning circadian rhythm and physiological arousal. The participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness, as evidenced by a significantly low mean heart rate (MESOR = 58.35 bpm, Z-score = -2.13) and a low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z-score = -1.49). Both MESOR and resting heart rate show a positive correlation with CES-D (0.19), implying that these lower values are associated with a *lower* depressive symptom burden. The hourly aggregate deviation from the mesor exhibits a clear and robust circadian rhythm: heart rate decreases significantly during early morning hours (e.g., 12-5 AM, with Z-scores as low as -2.15) and increases sharply during the waking period, particularly a very pronounced rise in the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z-score = 3.24). This distinct day-night physiological oscillation suggests a well-defined circadian regulation and capacity for physiological arousal. However, certain aspects of circadian rhythm regularity are compromised. Interdaily stability is lower than average (Z-score = -0.9), and intradaily variability is significantly higher (Z-score = 1.44), suggesting less consistent day-to-day patterns and more frequent, rapid heart rate changes within a single day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also slightly lower than average (Z-score = -0.51), which, given its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.1), would imply a slightly higher depressive symptom burden. While the strong underlying physiological fitness and robust daily heart rate rhythm suggest a protective physiological profile, the increased variability and blunted amplitude might indicate some degree of physiological dysregulation.

The multimodal data present a nuanced picture with both strong protective factors and notable risk indicators for depressive symptoms. There is substantial evidence suggesting the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would likely place them in the bottom 50% of the study population distribution. Strong support for a lower depressive symptom burden comes from self-reported measures of psychological well-being: notably low trait anxiety (Z-score = -0.82, correlation with CES-D = 0.81), high self-esteem (Z-score = 0.26, correlation = -0.71), and significantly elevated happiness levels (Z-score = 1.64, correlation = -0.46). These factors exhibit strong correlations with CES-D, indicating that the participant's favorable scores on these measures are strongly associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.8, correlation = -0.39) and frequent exercise (Z-score for exercising with others = 1.23, correlation = -0.23) also contribute to a profile associated with lower depressive symptoms. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness (low resting heart rate Z-score = -1.49 and low MESOR Z-score = -2.13), both of which, given their positive correlation with CES-D (0.19), suggest a lower depressive burden. The robust and well-defined daily heart rate rhythm further reinforces this.

Conversely, evidence for an elevated depressive symptom burden primarily stems from significant sleep disturbances and certain aspects of circadian dysregulation. The participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score = 8.0). Objective sleep data show high variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 0.61) and, more critically, in sleep start times (Z-score = 1.12), alongside increased napping (Z-score = 0.61). These sleep irregularities are positively, albeit weakly (correlations ~0.2 to 0.22), associated with CES-D. Similarly, wearable data indicate higher intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score = 1.44) and a slightly lower heart rate rhythm amplitude (Z-score = -0.51), which, given its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.1), points towards higher depressive symptoms. However, the correlations between these sleep and circadian metrics and CES-D are generally weaker compared to the psychological well-being measures.

In a holistic assessment, the robust psychological protective factors (e.g., high self-esteem, low anxiety, high happiness), coupled with strong physiological fitness and consistent engagement in exercise, appear to significantly mitigate the impact of the noted sleep and circadian dysregulation on the participant's overall depressive symptom burden. While the sleep issues are a clear and notable concern, the strength of the correlations with CES-D from the self-reported well-being measures is substantially greater than those from the sleep/circadian metrics for which correlations are provided. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is relatively low or average within the study population.

59673,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by overall psychological resilience tempered by significant sleep disturbances and lower physical health satisfaction. Self-report data indicate a ""not anxious"" classification on the STAI-Trait scale (Z-score = -0.43) and notably high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.66), suggesting robust internal psychological resources. This is further supported by higher self-reported happiness (Z-score = 0.55) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 1.15). Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score = 0.1). Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, indicating strong functioning in their academic environment. However, this positive psychological outlook contrasts with a self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score = 0.59), which categorizes their sleep as disturbed, and a low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -1.2). Lifestyle behaviors include above-average wine or liquor consumption (Z-score = 0.94) and moderate engagement in exercise, particularly with others (Z-score = 0.53). Conversely, the participant reports low engagement in several passive recreational activities such as watching TV, playing video games, reading, and socializing with friends, potentially indicating a more active but less leisure-focused lifestyle, or a lack of engagement in these specific domains.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics corroborate the self-reported sleep difficulties. While the participant's median sleep duration is longer than average at 7 hours 37 minutes (Z-score = 0.54), there is significantly high variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 144 minutes, Z-score = 0.98), suggesting inconsistent sleep schedules. Sleep start times also show moderate variability (standard deviation of 98 minutes, Z-score = 0.33), and the participant engages in more frequent napping than the average study population (Z-score = 1.27). These objective metrics align with the subjective experience of disturbed sleep reported in the PSQI, pointing to issues with sleep regularity and quality rather than just duration.

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm features reveals generally average stability (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 0.09) and variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score = 0.17). However, the autocorrelation at 24 hours is lower than average (Z-score = -0.7), which may indicate less consistent day-to-day patterns in physiological activity. The MESOR and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm are average (Z-scores = 0.1 and 0.0, respectively), with the acrophase (peak physiological activity) occurring at 5:58 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.11). Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits notably elevated heart rate deviations during late-night hours (12-1 AM, Z-score = 1.72; 11-12 AM, Z-score = 1.49) and also shows higher activity in the early afternoon (1-2 PM, Z-score = 1.22) and early evening (6-7 PM, Z-score = 1.44; 5-6 PM, Z-score = 0.81). These patterns suggest heightened physiological arousal during periods typically associated with rest or lower activity, particularly late in the evening and stretching into the early morning, which could contribute to the observed sleep disturbances. Conversely, heart rate is appropriately low in the early morning hours (3-6 AM), consistent with deep sleep.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To determine the participant’s likely CES-D score ranking, we evaluate the combined evidence, giving greater weight to metrics with strong correlations to CES-D and salient Z-scores.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
The strongest indicators for a lower depressive symptom burden come from the self-report psychological trait measures. The participant's STAI-Trait score is in the ""not anxious"" range (Z-score = -0.43), and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81). A lower anxiety score thus strongly predicts a lower CES-D score. Similarly, the participant exhibits exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.66), a trait which has a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71). High self-esteem, therefore, strongly predicts a lower CES-D score. Additionally, higher self-reported happiness (Z-score = 0.55, r = -0.46) and above-average trust (Z-score = 1.15, r = -0.41) further support a lower depressive symptom profile. The participant's average perceived stress (Z-score = 0.1) does not indicate elevated stress contributing to depression, and a slightly lower resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.11, r = 0.19) could be interpreted as indicating lower overall physiological stress.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest an elevated risk for depressive symptoms. The participant reports clinically disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score = 8.0, Z-score = 0.59), which has a moderately strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.59). Further, objective sleep data from the wearable indicates significant variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 0.98) and more frequent napping (Z-score = 1.27), both of which have weak positive correlations with CES-D (r = 0.2 and r = 0.22, respectively). Low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -1.2) also presents as a factor, with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.40), implying lower health satisfaction is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The patterns of elevated physiological arousal at night (e.g., 12-1 AM and 11-12 AM heart rate deviations), while having weak or slightly negative correlations with CES-D in this dataset, could suggest underlying restlessness or difficulty unwinding, which can often accompany depressive states.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite significant sleep disturbances and lower health satisfaction, the participant's overall profile is strongly influenced by fundamental psychological well-being. The very strong inverse relationship between self-esteem and CES-D, coupled with a very strong positive relationship between anxiety and CES-D, means that the participant's high self-esteem and low anxiety are powerful protective factors against higher depressive symptomatology. These correlations are substantially stronger than those observed for sleep quality or health satisfaction. While the disturbed and variable sleep, along with increased napping, are notable concerns, they appear to be offset by robust psychological traits. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

74899,17.0,0.727979274611399,"This participant's data presents a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and elevated physiological activity, alongside notable strengths in interpersonal trust, health satisfaction, and exercise habits.

**Psychological Traits and Well-being:**
The participant reports a notably anxious disposition (STAI score 52.0, Z-score 1.06, classified as 'anxious'), which correlates strongly and positively with CES-D scores (0.81). This is accompanied by lower self-esteem (RSES score 32.0, Z-score -0.87), a factor strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Perceived stress levels are markedly elevated (PSS score 30.0, Z-score 2.28), an observation that has a positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). Self-reported happiness is below average (Current Happiness 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Academically, the participant's GPA shows a declining trend across recent semesters. Counteracting these indicators of distress, the participant reports a significantly higher degree of interpersonal trust (Trust score 4.17, Z-score 1.79), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41), and also higher than average satisfaction with their physical health (Health Satisfaction 6.0, Z-score 1.3), also negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). Overall, this suggests an individual experiencing considerable internal distress, anxiety, and self-esteem challenges, yet maintaining positive outlooks on trust and health.

**Sleep Patterns and Quality:**
Both self-reported and wearable data indicate significant sleep difficulties. The participant’s Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) classifies their sleep as disturbed. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 5 hours 58 minutes (Z-score -1.52), indicating significantly shorter sleep than the study population average. The median sleep start time is notably late at 02:25:30. Despite the short duration and late onset, there is relatively low variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 84 minutes, Z-score -0.39) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 65 minutes, Z-score -0.38). The participant also reports no daily napping (Z-score -0.86). These findings collectively describe a pattern of objectively restricted and subjectively disturbed sleep, though with a degree of day-to-day regularity.

**Circadian Rhythms and Physiological Activity:**
The participant's heart rate data reveals an average baseline cardiovascular activity (Mesor of 80.87, Z-score 0.95) and slightly elevated resting heart rate (62.1 bpm, Z-score 0.47), both of which are weakly positively correlated with CES-D. Circadian rhythm regularity, as indicated by Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.17) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.46), falls within or slightly above average ranges. The Acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:49 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor demonstrates a typical diurnal pattern with significantly reduced heart rate during the sleep period (e.g., -21.29 bpm at 7-8 AM) followed by a substantial increase during the waking hours. A particularly salient feature is the pronounced peak in physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon/early evening, specifically between 5-6 PM, where the mean heart rate deviates by 22.1 bpm from the mesor, representing a Z-score of 1.69, indicating significantly higher activity during this period compared to the population average. This strong late-day activation suggests a robust daily rhythm, but with a notable peak in cardiovascular activity that could be related to daily stressors or a highly active routine.

**Lifestyle Behaviors:**
The participant exhibits an active lifestyle, reporting exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), and engaging in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.91). These exercise habits are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Substance use includes 1-2 times a week consumption of beer (Z-score 1.01), which is higher than average, and 1-2 times a month consumption of wine or liquor, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. In terms of daily recreation, the participant spends 1-2 hours on the internet and socializing, but reports doing no video games, reading, or sedentary hobbies, and listening to music for 15 minutes or less, suggesting a lower engagement in solitary, often calming, leisure activities.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score:**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The participant's self-reported psychological state exhibits several strong indicators for an elevated depressive symptom burden. They report significantly higher than average anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.06, strongly correlated with CES-D at 0.81), very high perceived stress (PSS Z-score 2.28, correlated at 0.28), and lower self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.87, strongly negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.71), all of which align with increased depressive symptomatology. Lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) also correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.46). Furthermore, both self-reported and objective sleep data point to significant sleep disturbance: a high PSQI score (9.0, Z-score 1.05) and objectively short median sleep duration (5 hours 58 minutes, Z-score -1.52) are commonly associated with depressive symptoms. The elevated Mesor heart rate (Z-score 0.95) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.47), both weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggest a slightly higher baseline physiological arousal. The declining GPA trend might also indirectly reflect the impact of psychological distress on academic functioning.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest potential resilience or protective mechanisms against higher depressive symptoms. The participant demonstrates significantly higher interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.79, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.41) and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.3, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.39). Engagement in frequent exercise, both alone and with others, and sports (all Z-scores > 0.5) are generally considered protective against depression. Objective sleep metrics also indicate relatively low variability in sleep duration and start times (Z-scores -0.39 and -0.38 respectively), and an absence of napping (Z-score -0.86), all of which, given their positive correlations with CES-D, suggest these aspects of sleep are not contributing to a higher burden of symptoms for this participant.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When weighing the evidence, the indicators pointing towards an elevated CES-D score are more numerous and, crucially, include variables with strong correlations to depressive symptoms (STAI, Self-Esteem, Perceived Stress, Happiness, and sleep quality). The magnitudes of the Z-scores for anxiety (1.06), perceived stress (2.28), low self-esteem (-0.87), and short sleep duration (-1.52) are substantial. While the participant exhibits commendable strengths in social trust, health satisfaction, and consistent exercise, these do not appear sufficient to fully offset the pervasive internal distress and sleep deficits. The combination of high anxiety, significant perceived stress, lower self-esteem, and chronic sleep deprivation strongly suggests a depressive symptom burden beyond the population median. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

35011,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a complex profile, exhibiting a notable contrast between self-reported psychological well-being and objective physiological and behavioral indicators. Subjective psychological measures suggest relatively low levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.52) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.98), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-reported happiness is higher than average (Z-score = 0.55), and self-esteem is notably elevated (Z-score = 0.96), both factors typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Interpersonal trust is at an average level (Z-score = -0.14). These self-perceptions, if taken in isolation, would indicate a resilient psychological state.

However, this subjective emotional profile stands in stark contrast to several critical objective and self-reported health and behavioral metrics. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7 categorizes the participant's sleep as disturbed, indicating significant sleep difficulties. Wearable data further substantiates this, showing a short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score = -1.37) and a very late median sleep start time of 02:34:00, despite a relatively average sleep duration consistency (Standard Deviation Z-score = -0.87). This pattern of late, short, and disturbed sleep is a strong indicator of sleep dysregulation, a common feature in depressive states.

Furthermore, a significant degree of physiological and circadian rhythm disruption is evident. The participant's resting heart rate is markedly high (77.6 bpm, Z-score = 2.31), as is their MESOR (average heart rate over 24 hours) at 86.67 (Z-score = 1.74), both suggesting elevated chronic physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm derived from heart rate data displays very low interdaily stability (0.17, Z-score = -1.98) and a very low amplitude (4.29, Z-score = -2.1), alongside high intradaily variability (0.74, Z-score = 1.37). This combination indicates a highly irregular, fragmented, and blunted daily physiological rhythm, reflecting a significant breakdown in the regular patterning of rest and activity, which is strongly associated with adverse mental health outcomes including depression. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR show periods of elevated activity during the day but reveal that even during typical rest periods (e.g., 2-7 AM), heart rate remains relatively elevated when considering the overall high resting heart rate and MESOR.

Behaviorally, the participant reports lower than average engagement in physical exercise (1-2 times a month across categories) and reduced socialization with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = -0.62). They also report not engaging in reading or sedentary hobbies, but spend a higher amount of time watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score = 0.64). Substance use (beer, wine/liquor) is above average, but these behaviors showed only weak correlations with CES-D scores in the study population. These activity patterns, particularly reduced physical activity and social engagement, can be both symptoms and contributing factors to depressive symptomatology. Academically, the participant's GPA shows a concerning decline across academic semesters (Fall 2015: 3.53 to Fall 2016: 3.1), which may indicate functional difficulties or reduced engagement. Most strikingly, the participant reports very low satisfaction with their physical health (Score = 1.89, Z-score = -1.78), a metric that shows a negative correlation with CES-D scores, suggesting that lower health satisfaction is associated with higher depressive symptoms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence pointing towards a higher depressive symptom burden despite some self-reported emotional well-being. The participant exhibits significant objective sleep disturbance (PSQI score of 7, short sleep duration, very late sleep onset), profound circadian rhythm disruption (very low interdaily stability and amplitude, high intradaily variability), and elevated physiological arousal (very high resting heart rate and MESOR). These physiological and sleep metrics represent extreme deviations from the study population average and are strongly implicated in depressive disorders. Complementing these objective findings are subjective reports of very low health satisfaction and a concerning decline in academic performance, along with reduced engagement in physical activity and social interaction. While self-reported anxiety, stress, happiness, and self-esteem suggest a more favorable emotional state, the comprehensive picture of physiological dysregulation, impaired sleep, and reduced functional capacity strongly outweighs these self-perceptions. Given the prevalence of somatic and behavioral symptoms in depression, the robust evidence from wearables and health satisfaction points to a higher overall symptom burden. Therefore, it is likely that the participant's CES-D score would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
89710,39.0,0.9818652849740933,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety and significantly diminished self-worth. Specifically, their STAI score of 55.0 (Z-score = 1.35) places them considerably above the population mean for chronic anxiety, a measure strongly positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Concurrently, their Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 25.0 (Z-score = -1.85) indicates very low self-esteem, which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.7). Further evidence of psychological distress includes markedly low self-reported happiness (Z-score = -1.61, r=-0.45) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.7, r=-0.39), alongside notably low interpersonal trust (Z-score = -1.74, r=-0.4). While perceived stress levels (Z-score = -0.17) are near the population average, the confluence of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and general dissatisfaction across several life domains presents a pattern often associated with increased depressive symptomatology.

Regarding sleep and circadian patterns, the participant reports significant subjective sleep disturbance, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score = 1.52), indicating clinically significant poor sleep quality. Objectively, Fitbit data shows slightly below-average median sleep duration of 6 hours and 44 minutes (Z-score = -0.56). More notably, there is considerable variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 133 minutes, Z-score = 1.09), a metric positively correlated with CES-D (r=0.21). Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms reveals significantly low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.56) and a somewhat reduced amplitude (Z-score = -1.04), indicating a less regular and less robust day-to-day physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:57 PM. Hourly heart rate data further supports this, showing a pronounced peak of physiological activity in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, deviation from mesor = 20.32, Z-score = 1.43), which is significantly higher than the population mean for that hour, contrasting with relatively less pronounced activity in the morning. This pattern of irregular sleep timing and a dampened, shifted physiological rhythm, combined with subjectively poor sleep quality, suggests challenges in maintaining a stable and healthy sleep-wake cycle.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in several sedentary and screen-based recreational activities at levels substantially above the study population average. This includes high engagement in video games (Z-score = 1.71), internet usage (Z-score = 2.19), and listening to music (Z-score = 2.06). Notably, internet usage and music listening are moderately positively correlated with CES-D (both r=0.24). Alcohol consumption (wine or liquor) is also somewhat elevated (Z-score = 0.94). Exercise habits appear mixed, with less frequent solitary exercise but average frequency of exercising with others. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, showed a decline from 3.7 in Fall 2015 to 3.2 in Fall 2016. These behavioral tendencies suggest a lifestyle that leans towards increased solitary, screen-based activities, which, when coupled with the observed psychological and sleep disturbances, could contribute to or reflect difficulties in well-being.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological traits provide substantial evidence for a high CES-D score. They exhibit significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.35, r=0.81), severely low self-esteem (RSES Z-score = -1.85, r=-0.7), and markedly reduced happiness (Z-score = -1.61, r=-0.45) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.7, r=-0.39). Interpersonal trust is also significantly low (Z-score = -1.74, r=-0.4). All these metrics demonstrate strong correlations with CES-D scores, with the participant's values consistently aligning with indicators of higher depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is profoundly disturbed (PSQI Z-score = 1.52), and objective sleep timing is highly irregular (sleep start time standard deviation Z-score = 1.09, r=0.21), both of which are common features in depression. Circadian rhythm analysis also indicates lower interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.56) and amplitude (Z-score = -1.04), which suggest a less robust and regular physiological rhythm, often associated with mood dysregulation. Increased sedentary screen time, particularly for internet usage and listening to music, is also observed and shows moderate positive correlations with CES-D (both r=0.24).

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score is comparatively limited. The participant's perceived stress level is near the population mean (Z-score = -0.17), rather than elevated, although its correlation with CES-D is weakly positive (r=0.29). Their resting heart rate (Z-score = 0.01) and intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.03) are within the average range. While the heart rate mesor is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.45), its weak positive correlation (r=0.2) would, if anything, slightly lean towards a lower CES-D, but this effect is minimal and not strong enough to counter other evidence. Several hourly heart rate deviations show weak or near-zero correlations with CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the participant experiences a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. The profound deviations in self-reported psychological traits—including elevated anxiety, critically low self-esteem, reduced happiness and health satisfaction, and low trust—are particularly compelling, given their strong correlations with CES-D scores. These findings are significantly reinforced by severe subjective sleep disturbance, objective irregularities in sleep timing, and an overall less stable and robust physiological circadian rhythm. While a few metrics, such as perceived stress and some average physiological measures, do not strongly indicate high depression, they are vastly outweighed by the numerous and potent indicators pointing to elevated depressive symptomatology across multiple domains. Therefore, based on the holistic integration of self-report and wearable data, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the upper half of the study population distribution.

97596,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress alongside generally healthy lifestyle behaviors and stable, albeit slightly elevated, physiological arousal. Self-report measures reveal notable psychological challenges: the participant's STAI score of 47.0 (Z-score 0.56) indicates above-average trait anxiety, a finding strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.82). Concurrently, self-reported happiness is significantly low (score 2.0, Z-score -1.61), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.46), and perceived stress is markedly high (score 32.0, Z-score 2.83), positively correlating with CES-D (0.27). Furthermore, self-esteem is slightly below average (score 36.0, Z-score -0.31) with a strong negative correlation to CES-D (-0.71), and interpersonal trust is also below average (score 2.83, Z-score -0.78), showing a moderate negative correlation (-0.41). These combined psychological indicators present a consistent pattern suggestive of elevated emotional distress and vulnerability.

Regarding sleep, a notable discrepancy exists between subjective experience and objective wearable data. The participant reports extremely poor subjective sleep quality, indicated by a PSQI score of 15.0 (Z-score 3.83), which is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" and is substantially higher than the population average. In contrast, objective Fitbit data show a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes (Z-score 1.22), indicating longer-than-average nightly sleep. The consistency of sleep duration is also above average (standard deviation of 60 minutes, Z-score -0.92), and sleep start times are relatively stable (standard deviation of 90 minutes, Z-score 0.15). The disconnect between objectively adequate sleep duration and subjectively poor sleep quality, coupled with the high PSQI score, suggests that while sleep quantity may be sufficient, the participant experiences significant qualitative sleep issues, which are frequently associated with depressive symptoms.

The participant's lifestyle behaviors generally lean towards health-promoting activities. Exercise frequency is high, with self-reported exercise alone three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), both correlating negatively with CES-D. Substance usage is low across categories, with minimal alcohol consumption and no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (score 5.22, Z-score 0.72), which correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.4). In terms of daily recreation, the participant spends a significant amount of time listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06), which interestingly shows a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.24), and also engages in above-average reading and socializing. These activity patterns suggest engagement in potentially buffering behaviors, but some choices, like extensive music listening, could also align with coping mechanisms in distress.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices indicate a pattern of slightly elevated underlying arousal. The participant's average heart rate (Mesor 77.83 bpm, Z-score 0.53) and resting heart rate (63.6 bpm, Z-score 0.65) are both modestly above the population mean, with positive correlations to CES-D (0.19). The Intradaily Variability (0.66, Z-score 0.81) is also higher than average, suggesting less stable physiological rhythms throughout the day. While other circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability and Autocorrelation, are near population averages, the elevated Mesor and Resting Heart Rate, coupled with higher Intradaily Variability, could be indicative of a sustained state of mild physiological activation. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with pronounced dips during nocturnal hours and peaks during the late morning and late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 9-10 AM, 5-7 PM), consistent with daily activity, and the acrophase is at 4:14 PM. These hourly patterns do not present clear anomalies indicative of severe circadian disruption but rather reflect an elevated baseline and possibly more pronounced physiological responses during active periods.

A substantial body of evidence from the self-report data points towards the participant experiencing a relatively high burden of depressive symptoms, likely placing them in the top 50% of the study population for CES-D scores. The most compelling indicators include a high STAI score (47.0, Z-score 0.56), which assesses chronic anxiety and exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D. This suggests a significant overlap between the participant's anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the participant reports extremely poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 15.0, Z-score 3.83), a level indicating clinically significant sleep disturbance, which is a common and often severe symptom in depression. Perceived stress is also markedly elevated (PSS score 32.0, Z-score 2.83), a factor moderately correlated with CES-D (0.27). In line with these findings, self-reported happiness is significantly low (Z-score -1.61) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (-0.46), and self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.31) with a strong negative correlation (-0.71). Slightly elevated physiological markers, such as Mesor and Resting Heart Rate (Z-scores 0.53 and 0.65 respectively), and higher Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.81), further suggest increased physiological arousal or less stable rhythms, which can be associated with higher distress and depressive symptoms (Mesor and RHR both correlate positively with CES-D at 0.19).

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, certain aspects of the participant's profile suggest counter-indications to high depressive symptomatology, potentially favoring a lower or median CES-D score. The participant maintains a relatively active lifestyle, engaging in above-average frequencies of exercising alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 0.53). These exercise habits typically correlate negatively with CES-D, suggesting a potential protective factor. Objective sleep data from the Fitbit shows a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes (Z-score 1.22), which is longer than the population average, and also indicates more consistent sleep duration (Z-score -0.92). High health satisfaction (Z-score 0.72) also correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.4). Additionally, substance usage is reported as low across all categories, which generally aligns with lower depressive symptom burden.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Weighing the totality of the evidence, the self-reported psychological distress and sleep disturbance are particularly striking and highly indicative of elevated depressive symptoms. The very strong correlations between STAI, self-esteem, happiness, and CES-D, combined with the extreme PSQI score and high perceived stress, represent a compelling case for significant psychological burden. While positive lifestyle factors like frequent exercise and longer objective sleep duration are present, they are overshadowed by the intensity of the reported psychological and subjective sleep difficulties. The discrepancy between objective sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality is critical, as the experience of disturbed sleep (captured by PSQI) is a direct symptom often associated with depression, irrespective of total duration. The slightly elevated physiological arousal further supports a state of heightened distress. Therefore, the overall pattern strongly suggests that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would likely fall into the higher end of the study population distribution.

57359,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile across self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological metrics. Psychologically, the individual reports below-average levels of self-esteem (Z-score -0.45) and happiness (Z-score -0.53), which are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r = -0.71 for self-esteem, r = -0.46 for happiness). This suggests potential difficulties with self-worth and mood. Additionally, self-reported satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score -0.37, r = -0.39 with CES-D), further indicating a subjective sense of reduced well-being. Despite these areas, the participant reports lower-than-average anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.71), traits that typically correlate positively with CES-D (r = 0.81 for STAI, r = 0.28 for PSS). This indicates a capacity to manage general anxiety and stress effectively, potentially serving as a protective factor against overt distress. Interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Z-score 0.18), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.41), suggesting a positive social disposition. Academically, the participant maintains an excellent GPA, indicating strong cognitive functioning and success in their academic environment.

Behaviorally, the participant's sleep patterns show both strengths and areas of concern. While Fitbit data indicates a significantly above-average median sleep duration of 8 hours 8 minutes (Z-score 1.18) and consistent sleep start times (Z-score -0.19 for standard deviation), the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies their subjective sleep as ""Disturbed."" This discrepancy between objective duration and subjective quality suggests that while the participant obtains sufficient sleep hours, the restorative quality may be lacking. Furthermore, a significantly high frequency of daily napping (Z-score 1.27) and average variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.16) weakly correlate with higher CES-D, potentially indicating daytime fatigue or fragmented sleep-wake regulation. In terms of physical activity, the participant engages in sports at an above-average frequency (Z-score 0.91), which weakly correlates with lower CES-D (r = -0.15), suggesting a positive engagement with physical activity. However, participation in exercise with others is notably low (Z-score -1.58), which is weakly correlated with higher CES-D (r = -0.23), indicating potential social withdrawal from group physical activities. Daily recreational habits include above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.85) and listening to music (Z-score 0.21), both weakly correlated with higher CES-D. Substance use, particularly beer, wine, and liquor, is above average, but correlations with CES-D are negligible.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics offer insights into the participant's cardiovascular and circadian regulation. The participant maintains a healthy, below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.7) and a below-average mesor (mean heart rate, Z-score -0.41), both weakly correlated with lower CES-D (r = 0.19). These indicators suggest good cardiovascular fitness. The heart rate-based circadian rhythm, characterized by an acrophase at 4:00 PM and an amplitude slightly above average (Z-score 0.24), indicates a robust daily fluctuation in physiological activity. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a pronounced dip during early morning hours (e.g., -22.17 at 3-4 am), consistent with deep rest, followed by a significant surge in activity in the morning (e.g., +17.81 at 8-9 am) and sustained elevation through the day, returning to baseline late in the evening. This pattern suggests a well-defined daily rhythm of physiological arousal. Circadian stability measures, including interdaily stability (Z-score 0.17) and intradaily variability (Z-score -0.25), are within typical ranges, but autocorrelation at 24 hours is notably low (Z-score -1.03), implying less day-to-day consistency in activity patterns. While this decreased consistency could indicate some irregularity in daily routines, the overall physiological rhythm appears strong, with negligible correlations to CES-D.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

To determine whether the participant's CES-D score likely falls into the top or bottom half of the study population (median CES-D = 11.5), we weigh the available evidence.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits several factors associated with lower depressive symptomatology. They report below-average anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.23) which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), meaning lower anxiety is indicative of lower CES-D. Similarly, their perceived stress is below average (PSS Z-score -0.71), weakly correlating with lower CES-D (r = 0.28). Trust levels are slightly above average (Z-score 0.18) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.41), suggesting higher trust as a protective factor. Engagement in sports is above average (Z-score 0.91) and weakly correlates with lower CES-D. Physically, the participant has a healthy, below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.7) and mesor (Z-score -0.41), both weakly correlated with lower CES-D. Objective sleep duration is significantly high (8 hours 8 minutes, Z-score 1.18), and sleep start times are relatively consistent. These indicators suggest a resilient profile in terms of general anxiety, stress perception, cardiovascular health, and certain aspects of sleep and physical activity.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, several critical indicators suggest elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant's self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.45) and carries a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), implying that lower self-esteem is a significant predictor of higher CES-D. Self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score -0.53) with a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.46), pointing towards reduced positive affect. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI (score 6.0), indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a common symptom associated with depression, despite objective measures of sufficient sleep duration. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score -0.37, r = -0.39 with CES-D), contributing to a general sense of unease. Behavioral patterns such as significantly low participation in exercising with others (Z-score -1.58, r = -0.23 with CES-D) and a high frequency of napping (Z-score 1.27, r = 0.21 with CES-D) are also associated with higher CES-D, potentially reflecting social withdrawal or ongoing fatigue despite ample sleep.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant demonstrates strengths in managing anxiety and stress and exhibits robust physiological rhythms, the cluster of subjective well-being measures – specifically below-average self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, coupled with subjectively disturbed sleep – are strongly and moderately correlated with higher depressive symptoms. The very strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D, combined with the participant's below-average self-esteem, is a particularly potent indicator. The reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score) is a significant clinical flag, often a core component of depression, which is further supported by the high frequency of napping despite long sleep duration. The observed social withdrawal from group exercise also aligns with behavioral patterns sometimes seen in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. Given the substantial correlations of self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction with CES-D, and the clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, the evidence leans towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

17308,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological data present a nuanced profile. They report slightly above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.17) and significantly above-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.92), both of which are positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81 and 0.28, respectively), suggesting a predisposition toward or experience of elevated psychological distress. Complementing this, self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17) and interpersonal trust is also slightly below average (Z-score = -0.14), with both negatively correlating with CES-D scores (-0.71 and -0.41, respectively), indicating that lower levels in these traits are associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score = 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.8), both negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.46 and -0.39), which would typically suggest lower depressive symptomatology. This juxtaposition of elevated anxiety/stress and concurrently high happiness/health satisfaction presents a mixed psychological picture, requiring consideration of the relative strength of correlations.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains high academic performance, with a consistently strong GPA. Their substance usage patterns indicate above-average alcohol consumption (Beer Z-score = 1.01; Wine or Liquor Z-score = 0.94) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise engagement is notably high across all categories (exercising alone, with others, and sports, all with high positive Z-scores), and exercise generally correlates negatively with CES-D scores, suggesting a protective behavioral pattern against depression. However, a significant pattern of very low engagement across multiple daily recreational activities is observed. Specifically, internet usage (Z-score = -1.83) and socializing with friends (Z-score = -1.41) are substantially below population averages, with reading, watching TV/videos, video games, and sedentary hobbies also reported as minimal or non-existent. While direct correlations with CES-D for these individual activities are weak or suggest minimal time spent on them is associated with lower CES-D, the overall pattern of significantly reduced engagement in a broad range of social and leisure pursuits could be indicative of reduced interest or anhedonia.

Objective sleep metrics derived from wearable data reveal remarkably consistent and healthy sleep patterns. Despite a PSQI score of 5, which can indicate sleep disturbance, the participant's Z-score of -0.8 places their subjective sleep quality well below the population average (indicating better sleep). Further, median sleep duration is slightly above average (7 hours 27 minutes, Z-score = 0.33). Crucially, sleep duration standard deviation (Z-score = -0.84) and sleep start time standard deviation (Z-score = -1.02) are both significantly *below* average, indicating exceptional regularity in their sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Z-score = -0.86) also points to consolidated nocturnal sleep. Notably, *all* of these objective sleep consistency metrics have positive correlations with CES-D scores, meaning that the participant's high consistency (low standard deviations, no naps) strongly suggests a *lower* CES-D score.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits indicators of robust cardiovascular health and a well-regulated circadian rhythm. Their resting heart rate (47.2 bpm, Z-score = -1.3) and mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours, Z-score = -1.79) are both significantly below the population average, indicative of high cardiovascular fitness. These metrics also have positive correlations with CES-D scores, meaning their *lower* resting heart rate and mesor suggest a *lower* CES-D score. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear and pronounced diurnal pattern, with deep troughs during sleep hours (e.g., -18.04 to -22.98 deviation from mesor between 1-3 AM, Z-scores down to -1.46) and distinct peaks during active periods (e.g., +18.65 deviation from mesor between 10-11 AM, Z-score = 1.98; and +14.73 to +17.52 between 3-6 PM, Z-scores up to 1.21). This robust amplitude and clear daily fluctuation suggest a healthy physiological response to the sleep-wake cycle, rather than the blunted rhythms sometimes associated with depressive states. Non-parametric circadian rhythm measures (interdaily stability, intraday variability, autocorrelation at 24 hours) are close to population averages, not indicating significant dysregulation.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The participant reports elevated levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.17, with a strong positive correlation to CES-D of 0.81), perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.92, positively correlated with CES-D at 0.28), and slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score = -0.17, with a strong negative correlation to CES-D of -0.71). Additionally, a significantly low engagement across multiple daily recreational and social activities (e.g., Internet usage Z-score = -1.83, Socializing with Friends Z-score = -1.41) suggests a potential reduction in interest or pleasure, which is a common feature of depressive symptomatology.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Despite some indicators of psychological distress, there is substantial evidence pointing towards a lower CES-D score. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score = 0.55, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.46) and health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.8, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.39). Their lifestyle includes high engagement in exercise, a behavior known to be protective against depression. Crucially, objective wearable data demonstrate exceptionally good sleep quality and consistency: a favorable PSQI Z-score (-0.8), above-average sleep duration, and remarkably low standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score = -0.84) and sleep start time (Z-score = -1.02), coupled with no napping (Z-score = -0.86). All these sleep consistency metrics correlate positively with CES-D, meaning the participant's *high consistency* suggests a *lower* depressive symptom burden. Furthermore, physiological measures indicate excellent cardiovascular fitness, with a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.3) and mesor (Z-score = -1.79), both of which also correlate positively with CES-D, thus suggesting a *lower* CES-D score for this individual. The robust diurnal heart rate pattern also indicates healthy physiological regulation.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While self-reported psychological states like anxiety and stress, alongside reduced engagement in leisure activities, suggest a burden of depressive symptoms, the objective physiological and behavioral data provide powerful counter-evidence. The participant's outstanding sleep quality and consistency, coupled with excellent cardiovascular fitness and high exercise levels, are strong protective factors consistently linked to lower depressive symptoms as per their positive correlations with CES-D. These objective and less biased measures heavily outweigh the self-reported psychological distress indicators, and their strong association with *lower* CES-D scores is a critical interpretive point. The consistently high GPA also indicates maintained academic functioning. Therefore, despite some self-reported psychological concerns, the overall picture, heavily influenced by robust objective health and behavioral markers, suggests a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms within the study population.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
51851,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a strong profile of psychological well-being across several self-report measures, which significantly correlates with lower depressive symptoms. Specifically, self-esteem is notably high (Score: 46.0, Z-Score: 1.1), carrying a substantial negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), suggesting elevated self-worth is associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is low (Score: 35.0, Z-score: -0.62) and exhibits a high positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), indicating that lower anxiety is associated with reduced depressive symptoms. Further reinforcing this pattern, the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Score: 6.44, Z-score: 1.63), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.39), and perceives stress at a below-average level (Score: 20.0, Z-score: -0.44), with perceived stress having a positive, albeit weaker, correlation with CES-D (0.28). Conversely, some self-reported aspects present areas of potential concern. The participant reports slightly below-average current happiness (Score: 3.0, Z-score: -0.53), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting a connection between lower happiness and elevated depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is also considerably low (Score: 2.5, Z-score: -1.42) and negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.41), implying that lower trust is associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Regarding sleep and circadian patterns, a notable discrepancy exists between objective sleep duration and subjective sleep quality. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is average (6 hours 57 minutes, Z-score: -0.28). However, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59) classifies their subjective sleep as disturbed, indicating perceived difficulties despite adequate duration. Objectively, there is above-average variability in sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 111 minutes, Z-score: 0.61), which weakly correlates with higher CES-D scores (0.22), suggesting that inconsistent sleep initiation may contribute to depressive symptoms. Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics further elaborate on this. The participant exhibits very low Mesor (60.05 bpm, Z-score: -1.9) and Resting Heart Rate (41.1 bpm, Z-score: -2.03), which, counter-intuitively given typical fitness interpretations, show a low positive correlation with CES-D (0.19 for Mesor and RHR), implying lower HR values are associated with lower CES-D. However, the participant also displays higher than average intradaily variability (0.72, Z-score: 1.23) and lower interdaily stability (0.32, Z-score: -0.74) in heart rate, suggesting a more fragmented and less regular daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs later in the day at 4:57 PM. The aggregated hourly heart rate data show pronounced drops below the mesor during typical sleep hours (e.g., -25.76 bpm between 6-7 AM) and significant peaks above the mesor in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., +18.88 bpm between 6-7 PM, +16.4 bpm between 10-11 PM), consistent with the late acrophase and indicating a clear but somewhat later-shifted daily physiological rhythm.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant exhibits a highly active lifestyle with frequent engagement in exercise, both alone and with others, and sports (all Z-scores > 1.0, with negative correlations to CES-D, ranging from -0.09 to -0.23). Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is slightly above average, though recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent, and substance use correlations with CES-D are negligible. Daily recreation habits show below-average engagement in passive screen-time activities like watching TV/videos, video games, and internet usage. Conversely, music listening is notably high (2-3 hours, Z-score: 1.13), and interestingly, this habit shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.25). Socializing with friends is average, and reading is reported as ""do not do."" This pattern of high physical activity and lower passive screen-time engagement, alongside average social interaction, generally suggests a proactive behavioral profile.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a CES-D score in the bottom 50th percentile (relatively low or average depressive symptomatology) is robust and multifaceted, primarily driven by strong self-reported psychological well-being. The participant exhibits notably high self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1) and low trait anxiety (Z-score: -0.62), both of which are among the strongest correlates with lower CES-D (Self-Esteem correlation: -0.71; STAI correlation: 0.81, indicating that low anxiety is associated with low CES-D). Further supporting this position are high health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.63, correlation: -0.39) and below-average perceived stress (Z-score: -0.44, correlation: 0.28). Objectively, the very low Resting Heart Rate (Z-score: -2.03) and Mesor (Z-score: -1.9) also align with lower CES-D, as these metrics show a positive correlation (0.19) with CES-D, meaning lower values are associated with lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant's frequent engagement in exercise activities and lower engagement in passive screen time are generally indicative of a proactive lifestyle that can buffer against depressive symptoms.

Conversely, some indicators point towards potential elevated depressive symptomatology, suggesting a CES-D score in the top 50th percentile. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI score: 8.0), which is a common feature of depression. Below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score: -1.42, correlation: -0.41) and slightly reduced happiness (Z-score: -0.53, correlation: -0.46) are associated with higher CES-D. Objectively, a higher variability in sleep start times (Z-score: 0.61, correlation: 0.22) and fragmented physiological rhythms (high Intradaily Variability, Z-score: 1.23; lower Interdaily Stability, Z-score: -0.74) are also observed. Lastly, the participant's above-average time spent listening to music (Z-score: 1.13) positively correlates with CES-D (0.25), which, while not a strong correlation, points in the direction of higher depressive symptoms.

Upon holistic analysis, the evidence for lower depressive symptomatology appears more compelling. The strengths in self-esteem, low anxiety, health satisfaction, and low perceived stress, supported by their substantial correlations with CES-D, significantly outweigh the concerns arising from disturbed sleep, lower trust, and slightly reduced happiness. While sleep disturbances and fragmented physiological rhythms are noteworthy, the overall psychological profile, particularly the core mental health indicators, strongly suggests the participant's depressive symptom burden would place them in the lower half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
77872,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a pattern of psychological well-being characterized by lower levels of self-reported anxiety and higher self-esteem compared to the study population. Specifically, the participant's STAI score (Z=-0.82) is significantly below average, indicating low trait anxiety, which strongly correlates positively with lower CES-D scores (r=0.81). Similarly, self-esteem (Z=0.82) is notably higher than the population mean, a factor strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.71). Further supporting this profile are above-average levels of interpersonal trust (Z=0.83) and a significantly higher satisfaction with physical health (Z=0.97), both of which are negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Perceived stress (Z=-0.17) is slightly below average. However, the participant reports lower-than-average current happiness (Z=-0.53), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46), suggesting this could be a contributing factor to depressive symptomatology. Lifestyle habits indicate moderate engagement in exercise, particularly with others (Z=0.53), a behavior moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.23). While beer consumption is slightly above average (Z=1.01), recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreational activities show lower-than-average time spent on TV/videos and internet usage, which might align with lower CES-D, alongside significantly more time spent reading (Z=1.3).

Sleep patterns generally suggest good quality, with a self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (Z=-0.8) indicating good subjective sleep. Wearable data corroborates some aspects of sleep regularity, showing a significantly lower standard deviation in sleep duration (Z=-0.84), indicative of highly consistent sleep times, though median sleep duration (6 hours 50 minutes, Z=-0.44) is slightly below the population average. Consistency in sleep start time is average. Physiologically, the participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythm displays average interdaily stability but remarkably low intradaily variability (Z=-1.31), suggesting a highly stable and regular physiological pattern within each day. The heart rate mesor (mean heart rate) is elevated (Z=0.65), which is weakly positively correlated with CES-D. Conversely, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is higher than average (Z=0.75), signifying a robust circadian signal, which is weakly negatively correlated with CES-D. The acrophase, or peak activity time, is observed at 5:58 PM, consistent with typical diurnal rhythms.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rates during late-night hours, specifically between 11 PM and 12 AM (deviation of 15.87 bpm, Z=1.85) and 12 AM and 1 AM (deviation of 9.64 bpm, Z=1.63). These periods show heart rates considerably higher than the population average, suggesting heightened physiological activity or arousal during times typically associated with sleep onset and deeper sleep. In contrast, heart rate deviations are notably lower than average during the late morning, particularly between 11 AM and 12 PM (deviation of -4.35 bpm, Z=-1.69), indicating a comparatively reduced level of activity or arousal during this midday period. While the correlations of these specific hourly deviations with CES-D are weak, the magnitude of these physiological shifts points to a distinctive and somewhat atypical daily heart rate profile, characterized by pronounced late-night activity and a relative reduction in late-morning physiological output.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Considering the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest the participant's CES-D score would fall into the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a relatively low or average CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is robust. The participant reports significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.82) and significantly higher self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z-score 0.82), which are two of the strongest correlates with CES-D in the dataset (STAI correlation 0.81, SelfEsteem correlation -0.71). These indicators alone point strongly towards a lower depressive symptom burden. Furthermore, subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI Z-score -0.8), and health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score 0.97, correlation -0.39). Physiologically, the participant exhibits high consistency in sleep duration (Z-score -0.84) and very low intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score -1.31), suggesting stable behavioral and physiological rhythms. Above-average exercise with others (Z-score 0.53) also weakly supports a lower CES-D (correlation -0.23).

Conversely, evidence for an elevated CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is comparatively weaker. The most direct self-report suggesting higher symptoms is lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.46). While the participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rates during late-night hours (11 PM - 1 AM, Z-scores 1.85 and 1.63), which could imply disrupted sleep or arousal, their direct correlations with CES-D in this dataset are negligible or even weakly negative. The elevated mesor (Z-score 0.65) is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), but this is a minor contribution.

Holistically, the strong indicators of low anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep quality, and high health satisfaction, all with meaningful correlations to CES-D, significantly outweigh the less impactful counter-indicators such as slightly lower self-reported happiness or the late-night heart rate anomalies (which do not strongly correlate with CES-D in this specific dataset). Therefore, the overall evidence profile points to a lower burden of depressive symptoms.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
72348,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable strengths in certain domains alongside specific areas of concern that warrant interpretation in the context of depressive symptoms.

**Psychological Traits and Well-being:**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile demonstrates several protective factors. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is within the non-anxious range, with a Z-score of -0.23, indicating it is slightly below the study population's average. Given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D scores, this suggests a lower propensity for depressive symptoms from an anxiety standpoint. Furthermore, the participant exhibits above-average self-esteem (RSES score 34.0, Z-score -0.59), which, with a strong negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, is a significant indicator for a lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress (PSS score 22.0, Z-score 0.1) is average compared to peers, and health satisfaction (Score 4.89, Z-score 0.47) is above average, both showing weak to moderate negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting these aspects might marginally contribute to lower depressive symptoms. However, a notable area of concern is self-reported happiness, which is below average (Current 3.0, Z-score -0.53). This finding, coupled with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) with CES-D, indicates a reduced sense of well-being that could be associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant also demonstrates strong academic performance with consistently high GPAs.

**Sleep Patterns and Quality:**
Analysis of sleep data reveals a disparity between objective sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality. The participant records a significantly high median sleep duration of 8 hours and 22 minutes (Z-score 1.48), accompanied by remarkable consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation 39 minutes, Z-score -1.4) and sleep start time (standard deviation 26 minutes, Z-score -1.24). These objective measures indicate a highly structured and regular sleep schedule, typically considered beneficial for mental health. In contrast, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) categorizes the participant's sleep as 'Disturbed Sleep,' suggesting subjective difficulties with sleep quality despite adequate duration and consistency. This discrepancy between objective regularity and subjective disturbance is a key finding, potentially indicating non-restorative sleep or an underlying issue not captured by duration metrics alone.

**Physiological Arousal and Circadian Rhythms:**
Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a highly stable and well-entrained circadian rhythm. Parametric and non-parametric measures such as Interdaily Stability (Value 0.65, Z-score 1.99), Intradaily Variability (Value 0.43, Z-score -0.81), and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Value 0.62, Z-score 2.49) all point to exceptionally high regularity and low fragmentation in heart rate patterns across days. This robust circadian rhythmicity is generally considered a protective factor against mood disorders. However, markers of physiological arousal are elevated; the participant exhibits a high resting heart rate of 71.2 bpm (Z-score 1.55) and an elevated Mesor (average heart rate over 24 hours) of 86.31 bpm (Z-score 1.69). Both of these metrics, while having only weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.2), suggest a generally heightened baseline physiological activation. Examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals that while typical diurnal patterns are present (lower during sleep, higher during waking), the heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-6 AM) does not drop as significantly as that of peers (Z-scores for these hours are close to zero or slightly positive despite negative deviations), potentially indicating suboptimal physiological recovery during sleep. Later afternoon activity, conversely, is slightly lower than peers.

**Behavioral Habits:**
The participant's behavioral patterns show a distinct lack of physical activity alongside high engagement in sedentary recreation. Exercise frequency is consistently low across categories (e.g., '1-2 times a month' for exercising alone, 'Less than 1-2 times a month' for exercising with others, 'Not at all' for sports), with corresponding negative Z-scores, indicating significantly less physical activity than the population average. A lack of regular exercise is a recognized risk factor for depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant spends above-average time on sedentary recreational activities such as internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28), and engages in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41). While correlations with CES-D for these individual activities are weak, this overall pattern of low physical activity and high sedentary behavior can be associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Substance usage (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""Not at all"" across the board, with very low Z-scores, indicating a very low engagement in substance use compared to the study population.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score:**
Evaluating the participant's data holistically to determine their likely CES-D score distribution within the study population requires weighing the strength of various indicators, particularly those with notable correlations to CES-D.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower CES-D score stems from the participant's psychological trait measures. Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score -0.59), and it exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), indicating that higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, the participant's trait anxiety (STAI) is average to slightly below average (Z-score -0.23), and there is a strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D, meaning lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant maintains exceptionally stable and regular objective sleep patterns and robust circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.99, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 2.49, low sleep duration/start time standard deviations), which are generally considered protective factors against mood disturbances. High academic performance and very low substance use also suggest resilience in certain life domains.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, several factors suggest an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports 'Disturbed Sleep' (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), which is a common feature of depression. Self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting reduced positive affect. Physiologically, there is an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.55) and Mesor (Z-score 1.69), indicative of higher baseline physiological arousal, which can accompany stress or internalizing symptoms. Behavioral patterns reveal a significant lack of physical exercise and elevated engagement in sedentary activities, both of which are commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms, even if the provided correlations are weak. The discrepancy between objectively long sleep duration and subjectively disturbed sleep could also point towards non-restorative sleep or even hypersomnia, a symptom of atypical depression.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are significant indicators of distress, such as disturbed subjective sleep, lower happiness, elevated physiological arousal, and a sedentary lifestyle, the most strongly correlated psychological traits—self-esteem and trait anxiety—point towards a lower overall CES-D score for this participant. The participant's high self-esteem and average-to-low trait anxiety, when considered against their respective strong correlations with CES-D, exert a considerable influence on the likely overall depressive symptom score, suggesting a burden that is relatively lower compared to the study population's average. The objective stability in sleep and circadian rhythms also functions as a protective factor, even if subjective sleep quality is poor. Therefore, despite some clear challenges, the strongest correlational evidence, combined with objective markers of stability and resilience in core psychological traits, suggests the participant's CES-D score would fall into the lower half of the distribution.

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by a notable discrepancy between subjective psychological distress and objective behavioral patterns. Psychologically, there is an elevated level of trait anxiety (STAI score of 49.0, Z-score: 0.76), categorized as ""anxious,"" which shows a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores in the study population. This suggests a propensity towards experiencing anxiety that is significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Counteracting this, the participant reports high self-esteem (score of 40.0, Z-score: 0.26) and above-average happiness (Current score: 4.0, Z-score: 0.55), both of which are strongly (Self-Esteem, r=-0.71) or moderately (Happiness, r=-0.46) negatively correlated with CES-D scores, indicating their potential as protective factors against depression. Perceived stress is notably low (PSS score of 20.0, Z-score: -0.44), also suggesting a resilience to stress that generally correlates with lower depressive symptoms. However, health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.2), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.39), hinting at a minor potential contributing factor to increased depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, engaging in exercise and sports frequently (all Z-scores > 1.0 for different exercise types), which is generally associated with better mental health outcomes, with exercising with others showing a weak-moderate negative correlation (-0.24) with CES-D. While engaging in moderate alcohol consumption, other substance use is minimal. Recreational activities include a high frequency of reading (Z-score: 1.3) and significant time spent on video games (Z-score: 1.71) and watching TV/movies (Z-score: 0.64), some of which show weak positive correlations with CES-D, but their overall impact appears limited compared to other factors.

Sleep patterns present a key area of mixed findings. Objectively, the participant records a long median sleep duration of 8 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score: 1.26), with low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.81) and start time (Z-score: -0.9), indicative of a consistent sleep schedule. However, subjectively, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" suggesting that despite adequate duration, the quality of sleep or associated difficulties are present. This is further supported by a high frequency of daily napping (Z-score: 1.27), which is weakly positively correlated with CES-D and may indicate underlying fatigue or unrefreshing nighttime sleep.

Physiologically, heart rate data reveals an elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm, Z-score: 1.24) and a higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor = 80.34 bpm, Z-score: 0.87). Both metrics exhibit weak positive correlations with CES-D, potentially indicating a state of increased physiological arousal that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Despite this baseline elevation, the participant's circadian rhythm metrics show strong regularity, with high interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.24) and low intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.67). This suggests a well-entrained and robust daily physiological rhythm, which is typically a marker of good health and resilience. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest heart rates during nighttime sleep and peak activity in the early to mid-afternoon, reinforcing the presence of a structured daily physiological cycle despite the overall elevated cardiovascular baseline.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50th percentile):**
The most substantial evidence for an elevated CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported trait anxiety (STAI), which is categorized as ""anxious"" (Z-score: 0.76) and exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D. This indicates that their baseline anxiety proneness is a significant predictor of higher depressive symptoms within this population. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 7.0 signifies clinically significant ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a common comorbidity and risk factor for depression. Physiological markers such as an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 1.24) and higher mesor heart rate (Z-score: 0.87), both weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggest a state of heightened physiological arousal that can accompany depressive symptomatology. The high frequency of daily napping (Z-score: 1.27), also weakly positively correlated with CES-D, points to potential issues with sleep quality or daytime fatigue. Additionally, slightly below-average health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.2) with a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39) implies a slight tendency towards higher depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Significant counter-evidence for a lower CES-D score is presented through several strong protective factors. The participant reports high self-esteem (Z-score: 0.26), which has a very strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D. This suggests that their self-worth acts as a powerful buffer against depressive symptoms. Above-average self-reported happiness (Z-score: 0.55) and notably low perceived stress (Z-score: -0.44) further contribute to this protective profile, with moderate negative (r=-0.46) and weak positive (r=0.28, implying lower stress, lower CES-D) correlations, respectively. Behavioral habits reveal exceptionally high engagement in various forms of physical activity and sports (all Z-scores > 1.0), which are well-established ameliorating factors for depression, with exercising with others showing a weak-moderate negative correlation (-0.24) with CES-D. The high interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.24) and low intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.67) in heart rate circadian rhythms indicate a regular and structured physiological pattern, generally associated with better mental health. Lastly, the objectively measured long median sleep duration (8 hours 12 minutes, Z-score: 1.26), despite subjective sleep disturbance, suggests adequate recovery sleep in terms of quantity.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits elevated trait anxiety, which is strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms, this single robust indicator is counterbalanced by a collective array of strong protective psychological traits and health-promoting behaviors. The high self-esteem, above-average happiness, and low perceived stress, coupled with extensive physical activity, all present significant negative associations with CES-D scores, outweighing the influence of anxiety when considering the participant's specific Z-scores for these traits. Although physiological indicators like elevated heart rate and disturbed subjective sleep quality suggest potential vulnerability, the objective stability of circadian rhythms and long sleep duration point towards underlying physiological and behavioral resilience. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the relative strengths of these contributing and protective factors, particularly weighing the participant's specific Z-scores against their correlations with CES-D, the cumulative evidence points towards a lower overall burden of depressive symptoms. The collective impact of multiple protective factors appears to mitigate the strong signal from trait anxiety.

59900,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile, with self-reported psychological traits largely indicative of a favorable mental state, contrasted by significant disturbances in sleep patterns and certain behavioral habits. Psychologically, the participant reports low trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 37.0 (Z-score -0.43), indicating a ""not anxious"" classification, which typically correlates negatively with depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Score 39.0, Z-Score 0.11), and self-reported happiness (Score 4.0, Z-Score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (Score 3.67, Z-Score 0.83) are also above the study population mean. Furthermore, perceived stress levels are notably low (Score 19.0, Z-Score -0.71). Conversely, satisfaction with physical health is considerably below average (Score 2.67, Z-score -1.2), a factor that negatively correlates with CES-D scores. Overall, the majority of self-reported psychological measures suggest a lower predisposition to depressive symptoms, with the exception of health satisfaction.

In stark contrast to the self-reported psychological well-being, the participant exhibits profound sleep disturbances. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 14.0 (Z-Score 3.37) is exceptionally high, signifying clinically significant poor sleep quality over the past month. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals an unusually long median sleep duration of 9 hours and 22 minutes (Z-Score 2.71), indicating a pattern of hypersomnia relative to the study population. Compounding this, there is high variability in both sleep duration (Standard Deviation 169 minutes, Z-Score 1.55) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation 137 minutes, Z-Score 1.19). This substantial irregularity in sleep schedule and duration, along with the reported poor quality, suggests a significantly disrupted sleep architecture that is often associated with depressive symptomatology, particularly atypical depression.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices indicate some irregularities in the participant's circadian rhythms. While the resting heart rate (59.1 bpm, Z-Score 0.11) and Mesor (71.11, Z-Score -0.39) are within or close to the population average, measures of rhythmicity are less robust. Interdaily stability (0.32, Z-Score -0.74) is below average, suggesting less day-to-day regularity in activity and rest patterns. Intradaily variability (0.38, Z-Score -1.16) is also below average, which may indicate fewer transitions between high and low activity states during the day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (8.27, Z-Score -0.81) is lower than average, potentially reflecting a blunted physiological response to daily stressors or activities. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:37 PM. These patterns collectively point towards a somewhat disorganized and less pronounced cardiovascular circadian rhythm, which can be linked to mood disturbances. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates typical diurnal patterns of physiological arousal; however, the Z-scores highlight some relative differences. For instance, heart rate suppression during early morning sleep hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, 5-6 AM) is less pronounced than for the general population (positive Z-scores for negative deviations), potentially suggesting lighter sleep or earlier physiological arousal during these times.

Behavioral habits also present a mixed picture. The participant reports moderate substance use, with beer and wine/liquor consumed 1-2 times a week (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), which is higher than the population average but typically has a low correlation with CES-D. Crucially, the participant reports no engagement in exercise, either alone (Z-Score -1.93) or with others (Z-Score -1.58), and no participation in sports (Z-Score -1.09). This pronounced lack of physical activity is a significant finding, as regular exercise is widely recognized as a protective factor against depression and its absence is often associated with increased depressive symptoms. Daily recreational habits are largely within average ranges, with moderate screen time and socializing, and no engagement in video games or reading. The combination of significantly disrupted sleep, a sedentary lifestyle, and somewhat disorganized circadian rhythms provides a contrasting behavioral and physiological context to the otherwise favorable self-reported psychological traits.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (bottom 50%):**
*   **Low Trait Anxiety (STAI)**: The participant's STAI score of 37.0 (Z-score -0.43, ""not anxious"") is below the population mean. Given its strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), this suggests a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms.
*   **Low Perceived Stress (PSS)**: A PSS score of 19.0 (Z-score -0.71) indicates below-average perceived stress, which has a positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). This points towards a lower depressive symptom burden.
*   **Above-Average Self-Esteem**: The Self-Esteem score of 39.0 (Z-Score 0.11) is slightly above average. With a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), higher self-esteem is generally associated with lower depressive symptoms.
*   **Above-Average Happiness and Trust**: Self-reported happiness (Z-Score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (Z-Score 0.83) are both above average and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.41, respectively), suggesting a lower depressive symptom profile in these domains.
*   **Absence of Recreational Drug Use**: The participant reported ""Not at all"" for recreational and non-prescribed drug use (Z-scores -0.31 and -0.11), which has a positive correlation with CES-D, meaning lower use is associated with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (top 50%):**
*   **Profound Sleep Disturbance (PSQI)**: The PSQI score of 14.0 (Z-Score 3.37) is exceptionally high and indicative of severe sleep disturbance, which is a core symptom frequently associated with depression. This is the most salient negative indicator.
*   **Hypersomnia and Sleep Irregularity (Fitbit)**: Objectively, median sleep duration is extremely long (9 hours 22 minutes, Z-Score 2.71), a pattern known as hypersomnia that can be a manifestation of atypical depression. Furthermore, the high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-Score 1.55) and sleep start time (Z-Score 1.19) indicate significant irregularity, both of which positively correlate with CES-D (0.20 and 0.22, respectively).
*   **Lack of Exercise**: The participant reports ""Not at all"" for all forms of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93). Lack of physical activity is a well-established behavioral correlate of depression, and exercise with others has a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23), meaning less social exercise is associated with higher CES-D.
*   **Low Health Satisfaction**: Health satisfaction (Z-score -1.2) is notably below average. This metric has a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting lower satisfaction is associated with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Disrupted Circadian Rhythms**: Below-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.74), Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.16), and Amplitude (Z-score -0.81) suggest a less robust and regular heart rate-based circadian rhythm, patterns that can be observed in individuals with mood disorders.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a mixed picture. Self-reported psychological traits such as low anxiety and stress, and higher self-esteem and happiness, are strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms based on their correlations with CES-D. However, the evidence from sleep, health satisfaction, and activity patterns strongly points towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The PSQI score is extraordinarily high (over 3 standard deviations above the mean), unequivocally indicating severe sleep disturbance. This is reinforced by objective Fitbit data showing both hypersomnia and high variability in sleep patterns, both of which correlate with higher CES-D scores. Furthermore, the complete lack of physical exercise, a behavior known to buffer against depression, is a significant indicator. While the circadian rhythm metrics are less strongly correlated, they do suggest a degree of physiological dysregulation. Given the profound and multifaceted nature of the sleep disturbance and the sedentary lifestyle, these objective and behavioral indicators, despite the favorable self-reported mental state, collectively suggest a significant degree of depressive symptomatology. The magnitude of the negative indicators, particularly the extreme sleep scores, likely outweighs the positive self-reported psychological traits in determining the overall CES-D burden. Therefore, it is probable that the participant's CES-D score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by favorable psychological traits alongside discernible patterns of sleep disturbance and distinct physiological activity rhythms. Psychologically, the individual reports below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.92) and below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.71), both of which are negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, self-esteem (Z-score = 0.26), interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.18), and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.55) are all at or above the population average, and these factors generally correlate negatively with depressive symptom severity. Conversely, the participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53), a metric negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, suggesting a potential area of concern despite other positive psychological indicators.

Regarding sleep, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score = 0.13) indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, despite a median sleep duration of 6 hours 45 minutes, which is only slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.53). While sleep duration itself is relatively consistent (standard deviation of 45 minutes, Z-score = -1.26), which is associated with lower depressive symptoms, there is considerable variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 122 minutes, Z-score = 0.86). This increased irregularity in sleep onset is positively correlated with depressive symptom severity. Wearable-derived circadian metrics reveal a less stable heart rate rhythm across days (Interdaily Stability = 0.28, Z-score = -1.07) and a lower amplitude in the heart rate circadian rhythm (Amplitude = 8.37, Z-score = -0.78), both of which can indicate a less robust or dysregulated physiological rhythm. The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (61.9 bpm, Z-score = 0.45), which has a positive correlation with CES-D scores. However, the intradaily variability of heart rate (Z-score = -0.60) is below average, suggesting less fragmentation in daily physiological activity, which is generally considered a positive indicator.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrates a unique daily physiological pattern. The participant exhibits notably less heart rate suppression during the early morning hours (2-7 AM) compared to the study population, with several positive Z-scores in this period (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-score = 1.81), suggesting potentially lighter or less restorative sleep during these times. This is followed by a distinctively sharp and early rise in heart rate in the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM Z-score = 1.80), indicating an early physiological activation relative to the average. In the evening, there is a pronounced and rapid decline in heart rate from approximately 5 PM onwards, with Z-scores significantly below population averages (e.g., 6-7 PM Z-score = -2.03, 10-11 PM Z-score = -2.22), suggesting an earlier and more pronounced physiological de-activation. This combined pattern points to a compressed or shifted daily activity window, characterized by early physiological readiness and an early winding down, alongside potential disruption in the deeper stages of early morning sleep.

Regarding lifestyle behaviors, the participant's alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor) is slightly above the population average, though these behaviors demonstrate weak correlations with depressive symptoms in the study. Exercise habits, including exercising alone or with others and participating in sports, are generally consistent with population averages. Daily recreational habits, such as internet usage and socializing with friends, are slightly below average, but these specific behaviors show negligible correlations with CES-D scores for this participant.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on the multimodal analysis, there is substantial evidence to suggest the participant's CES-D score falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is robust, primarily from self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly lower-than-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.92), which has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, indicating that lower anxiety levels are strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, above-average self-esteem (Z-score = 0.26) with a strong negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, and below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.71) with a positive correlation (0.28), both strongly suggest a lower depressive symptom burden. Furthermore, higher health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.55, correlation -0.39) and greater sleep duration consistency (Z-score = -1.26, correlation 0.19 for variability) align with a lower CES-D score.

Conversely, some indicators suggest potential factors associated with a higher CES-D score (top 50th percentile). These include lower self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53, correlation -0.46) and clinically disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 7.0). Wearable data also points to increased variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 0.86, correlation 0.22), lower interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.07), a flatter circadian heart rate amplitude (Z-score = -0.78), and a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score = 0.45). The hourly heart rate patterns also suggest potentially less restorative sleep during early morning hours, which could contribute to depressive symptomatology.

However, the strength and consistency of the self-reported psychological indicators — particularly the significantly low anxiety and stress, and high self-esteem — carry substantial weight in predicting overall depressive symptom burden, given their strong correlations with CES-D scores. These factors collectively indicate a generally resilient psychological profile, which would likely mitigate the impact of the observed sleep and circadian disturbances on overall depressive symptomatology. Therefore, despite the sleep and physiological challenges, the participant's core psychological well-being measures place them in a position that is likely to reflect a relatively lower or average depressive symptom burden compared to their peers.

35347,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable strengths in certain self-reported psychological traits alongside several indicators of behavioral and physiological dysregulation. Psychologically, the participant reports a low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.02, classifying as 'not anxious') and exceptionally high self-esteem (RSES Z-score = 0.96). These attributes typically serve as protective factors against depressive symptoms, evidenced by their strong negative correlations with CES-D in the study population (STAI: 0.81, Self-Esteem: -0.71). However, other self-reported measures suggest areas of concern: interpersonal trust is notably low (Z-score = -2.07), self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53), and satisfaction with physical health is slightly lower than the mean (Z-score = -0.28). These factors show moderate negative correlations with CES-D (Trust: -0.41, Happiness: -0.46, Health Satisfaction: -0.39), suggesting a potential for elevated depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress levels are near the population average (PSS Z-score = 0.1), and academic performance remains consistently high, indicated by GPAs above 3.7.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits significant deviations in sleep, activity, and recreational habits. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score = 6.0), despite a slightly better-than-average PSQI Z-score (-0.33) relative to the population. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 29 minutes, which is significantly longer than average (Z-score = 1.61). However, this longer duration is accompanied by significantly high variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 1.04) and a remarkably high frequency of daily napping (Z-score = 2.66). The median sleep start time is notably late (02:12:00), though its variability is lower than average (Z-score = -0.6). These mixed sleep metrics, particularly the napping and high variability, are positively correlated with CES-D (0.22 and 0.2, respectively), suggesting disrupted sleep patterns that may contribute to depressive symptoms. Regarding physical activity, the participant reports significantly less exercise than peers across all categories (Z-scores for exercising alone, with others, and sports ranging from -0.88 to -1.18). Conversely, engagement in sedentary activities is high, with internet usage reported as more than 4 hours daily (Z-score = 2.19) and reading also exceeding 4 hours (Z-score = 6.21). These sedentary behaviors, especially internet usage, show weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.26), indicating a lifestyle that may be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Substance use is generally near average, except for recreational drug use, which is higher than average (Z-score = 1.61), although its correlation with CES-D is weak (0.16). The participant's Body Mass Index (17.19) is in the underweight range, potentially indicating a physical health concern.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveal both regularity and atypical patterns in heart rate (HR) and circadian rhythms. Parametric circadian measures indicate a slightly higher mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score = 0.43) and higher amplitude (Z-score = 0.63) than the population average. The higher Mesor has a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.19), while higher amplitude has a weak negative correlation (-0.1). Resting heart rate is near the population mean (Z-score = -0.04). Non-parametric circadian measures, Interdaily Stability (Z-score = 0.33) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score = 0.03), are close to average, suggesting typical regularity in the rhythm overall. However, a detailed analysis of hourly mean aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals distinct physiological patterns: significantly elevated HR is observed during early sleep hours (12-2 AM, Z-scores 1.46-1.7), suggesting potential sleep initiation issues or physiological arousal. Furthermore, the participant exhibits significantly lower HR than average during mid-morning (9 AM - 12 PM, Z-scores -1.82 to -2.59) and late afternoon (5-6 PM, Z-score -1.69), indicative of reduced physiological activity or arousal during these times. Conversely, a pronounced spike in HR deviation occurs in the early evening (6-7 PM, Z-score = 1.75), followed by sustained higher-than-average HR into the late evening (7-10 PM), suggesting an evening-shifted peak of activity or arousal. These atypical hourly HR patterns, particularly the elevated early sleep HR and the morning/afternoon dips, point towards a dysregulated physiological state that deviates from typical daily cardiovascular rhythms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on a holistic evaluation of the multimodal data, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is likely to place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

Evidence suggesting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is primarily derived from the participant's low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.02) and exceptionally high self-esteem (RSES Z-score = 0.96). These two psychological traits have the strongest correlations with CES-D in the study population (0.81 and -0.71, respectively), indicating that they are significant protective factors. The participant also maintains high academic performance and exhibits average perceived stress and consistent sleep start times, which might generally be associated with better mental health outcomes.

Conversely, a substantial body of evidence points towards a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile). The participant reports subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 6.0), very low interpersonal trust (Z-score = -2.07), and lower self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53), all of which are moderately to strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores. Behaviorally, there is a pervasive lack of physical exercise across all categories (Z-scores ranging from -0.88 to -1.18), coupled with significantly higher sedentary activities such as internet usage (Z-score = 2.19). Sleep patterns are further complicated by high variability in duration (Z-score = 1.04) and unusually frequent napping (Z-score = 2.66), both positively correlated with CES-D. Physiologically, the elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score = 0.43) and the distinct atypical hourly heart rate patterns, including elevated HR during early sleep and pronounced dips and evening peaks, suggest significant physiological dysregulation. The participant's underweight BMI also raises a general health concern. While strong protective factors are present, the cumulative impact of multiple behavioral and emotional challenges, coupled with objective physiological indicators of dysregulation and self-reported sleep disturbance, outweighs these strengths when considering overall depressive symptom burden.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of potential concern related to mood and well-being. They report below-average self-esteem (Z=-0.87), which demonstrates a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores, suggesting a heightened vulnerability to depressive symptoms. Similarly, current happiness is below the population average (Z=-0.53), also negatively correlated with CES-D. Health satisfaction is markedly low (Z=-1.45), representing a significant deviation from the mean and correlating with increased depressive symptomatology. While trait anxiety is classified as ""anxious"" with a slightly elevated Z-score of 0.46, and perceived stress is modestly above average (Z=0.38), these factors, combined with the more pronounced difficulties in self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, collectively suggest a predisposition towards or experience of depressive symptoms. In terms of academic performance, GPA shows some fluctuation, but this alone does not provide a direct indication of current mental state.

Sleep patterns reveal a disparity between subjective experience and objective measurement. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0. However, wearable data shows an objectively long median sleep duration of 7 hours and 54 minutes, which is above the population average (Z=0.89). Despite this extended sleep, the subjective poor quality suggests non-restorative sleep. The median sleep start time is notably late, around 2 AM, yet the sleep start time standard deviation is lower than average (Z=-0.73), indicating a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. Napping behavior is less frequent than average (Z=-0.86). This pattern of disturbed subjective sleep quality alongside objectively long but consistently late sleep may be indicative of certain sleep disturbances that can accompany depressive symptoms.

Behavioral engagement patterns further highlight potential indicators of depressive symptomatology. The participant reports significantly less time socializing with friends (Z=-1.41) and engaging in various forms of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -0.88 to -1.18). Conversely, there is a substantial increase in time spent on sedentary hobbies (Z=2.01) and passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, internet usage, and listening to music, all with above-average Z-scores. This profile suggests reduced active engagement with the environment and social withdrawal, favoring more solitary and passive forms of recreation. Wearable data on circadian rhythms reveals high interdaily stability (Z=1.41) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=0.81) coupled with below-average intraday variability (Z=-0.53). This indicates a highly regular and structured daily physiological rhythm, which, when combined with the behavioral patterns, might reflect a rigid or limited daily routine rather than a dynamic and varied one. The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurring later in the evening (5:58 PM), is consistent with the late sleep onset observed.

Physiological arousal, as inferred from heart rate data, presents a notable pattern. The participant's resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z=0.6). More significantly, the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal substantial elevations during the late evening and early night hours. Specifically, heart rates between 9 PM and 1 AM are notably higher than the typical daily average (with Z-scores peaking at 1.83 between 9-10 PM and remaining elevated above 1.1 during subsequent hours). This suggests a prolonged period of physiological arousal or activity during hours typically associated with relaxation and preparation for sleep. Such sustained elevation in cardiovascular activity could contribute to the self-reported disturbed sleep, making it difficult to unwind despite a regular sleep schedule. During early morning sleep, heart rates are significantly suppressed relative to the mesor, indicating a deep drop in activity during the core sleep period, following the late-night arousal.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Self-reported self-esteem (Z=-0.87) and current happiness (Z=-0.53) are both notably below average and negatively correlated with CES-D, indicating a potential struggle with mood and self-worth. Health satisfaction is substantially low (Z=-1.45), aligning with reduced overall well-being. Behaviorally, there is a clear pattern of social withdrawal and reduced physical activity, with significantly less time spent socializing (Z=-1.41) and exercising (all Z-scores below -0.88), while sedentary hobbies are notably increased (Z=2.01). These are common manifestations of depressive states. Furthermore, the participant self-reports clinically significant disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7), and physiological data suggests elevated heart rate activity extending into late evening hours, indicative of physiological arousal that could impede restorative sleep. Elevated trait anxiety (Z=0.46) and perceived stress (Z=0.38) also correlate with higher CES-D scores.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
The evidence suggesting a lower or median CES-D score is comparatively limited. The participant's objective median sleep duration of nearly 8 hours is above average, although this is contradicted by self-reported disturbed sleep, and hypersomnia can also be a depressive symptom. Wearable data shows a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm, which might imply a structured lifestyle; however, the correlation with CES-D is very weak. The participant also reports low substance usage across all categories, which is generally a positive health indicator, but these behaviors have minimal correlation with CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the predominant pattern points towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The significant deviations from population norms in self-reported measures of self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, coupled with behavioral patterns of social withdrawal, physical inactivity, and increased passive recreation, are strong indicators. While objective sleep duration is long, the subjective experience of disturbed sleep and the physiological evidence of late-night arousal suggest non-restorative sleep, often associated with depression. The limited evidence supporting a lower CES-D score (e.g., low substance use) does not sufficiently counterbalance the multitude of strong indicators suggesting elevated depressive symptomatology. Therefore, based on the comprehensive evidence, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely higher than the average study participant.

The participant demonstrates a psychological profile characterized by relatively low anxiety and robust self-esteem, which are factors often inversely related to depressive symptomatology. Specifically, their STAI score of 35.0 (Z-score = -0.62) indicates lower trait anxiety compared to the study population, a finding that correlates strongly and positively with CES-D scores (r = 0.81). Concurrently, a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 42.0 (Z-score = 0.54) signifies higher self-esteem, which correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D scores (r = -0.71). The participant also reports above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83, r = -0.41). However, self-reported happiness is somewhat lower than the population mean (Z-score = -0.53, r = -0.46), and satisfaction with physical health is also below average (Z-score = -0.45, r = -0.39). Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score = 0.1, r = 0.28). This blend suggests underlying psychological strengths in anxiety and self-worth, alongside some areas of diminished subjective well-being and health satisfaction.

Sleep patterns, as measured by both self-report and wearable data, indicate some disturbance but also notable regularity. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0, while classifying sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" corresponds to a Z-score of -0.33, suggesting that their subjective sleep quality is slightly better than the average for disturbed sleepers within the population. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score = -0.69), which is below the population average, but relatively consistent with a sleep duration standard deviation of 96 minutes (Z-score = -0.1). The median sleep start time is 00:42:45, with a relatively low standard deviation of 55 minutes (Z-score = -0.61), indicating stable sleep onset times. The absence of daily napping (Z-score = -0.86) is also noted. Weak positive correlations exist between CES-D and sleep duration variability, sleep start time variability, and napping, suggesting that the participant's relative consistency in these metrics may be associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle with no reported substance usage. They engage in exercise alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.32) and participate in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.91), indicating an above-average commitment to physical activity, with weak negative correlations to CES-D. Socializing with friends for 1-2 hours daily (Z-score = 0.16) aligns with the population average. Recreational screen time is varied, with above-average engagement in video games (Z-score = 0.96) and average internet usage, while listening to music is slightly below average. Most recreational activities show negligible correlations with CES-D, suggesting these habits do not strongly mediate depressive symptoms in this individual.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a robust and highly stable circadian rhythm based on heart rate data. Their Interdaily Stability (0.61, Z-score = 1.66) is notably high, reflecting consistent daily activity and rest patterns, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible (r = 0.0). Intradaily Variability is average (Z-score = -0.11), suggesting typical moment-to-moment heart rate fluctuations. Both the Mesor (mean heart rate, 67.23 BPM, Z-score = -0.92) and Resting Heart Rate (50.3 BPM, Z-score = -0.93) are notably lower than the population average, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. These metrics show a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.19), implying that lower heart rates are associated with lower depressive symptoms. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs at 4:57 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear and substantial physiological rhythm: heart rates significantly decrease during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -24.75 BPM at 5-6 AM relative to mesor) and rise substantially during active evening hours (e.g., +23.64 BPM at 8-9 PM relative to mesor). This pronounced amplitude (Z-score = 0.49) and consistent pattern suggest a well-entrained circadian system.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators pointing towards a relatively low or median depressive symptom burden. Their STAI score is low (Z-score = -0.62), indicating less trait anxiety than the population, which is strongly associated with lower CES-D scores (r = 0.81). Concurrently, their self-esteem is notably high (Z-score = 0.54), a factor that strongly negatively correlates with CES-D scores (r = -0.71). Subjective sleep quality, while classified as disturbed, is relatively better than the average disturbed sleeper in the population (PSQI Z-score = -0.33). Furthermore, the participant demonstrates high interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83, r = -0.41), and very high interdaily stability in their heart rate rhythms (Z-score = 1.66). Their lower-than-average resting heart rate and mesor (Z-scores ~-0.9), which positively correlate with CES-D, also suggest a lower symptom burden. Finally, consistent sleep timing and less napping are weakly associated with lower CES-D scores, and these metrics are stable or low for this participant.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, there are some data points that could indicate a higher CES-D score. The participant reports lower happiness than the population average (Z-score = -0.53), which moderately negatively correlates with CES-D (r = -0.46), implying lower happiness is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, their satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score = -0.45), moderately negatively correlating with CES-D (r = -0.39), suggesting lower health satisfaction may correspond to higher depressive symptoms. Additionally, their median sleep duration is somewhat shorter than average (Z-score = -0.69), although the correlation with CES-D is negligible (r = -0.01). Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score = 0.1), which does not strongly argue for a low CES-D score, given its weak positive correlation (r = 0.28).

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When evaluating the totality of evidence, the strongest correlates of CES-D, namely STAI (anxiety) and Self-Esteem, both indicate a lower depressive symptom burden for this participant. The participant's low anxiety and high self-esteem are substantial protective factors against depressive symptoms, with correlation magnitudes of 0.81 and -0.71, respectively. While lower happiness and health satisfaction (with moderate correlations of -0.46 and -0.39) point towards a higher CES-D, their impact appears to be outweighed by the robust indicators of psychological well-being. The consistent and stable physiological circadian rhythms, coupled with low resting heart rate, further support an overall profile not typically associated with high depressive symptomatology. Therefore, despite some areas of concern, the overall balance of evidence, particularly from strongly correlated psychological traits, suggests the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of potential concern. They report elevated anxiety, scoring 48.0 on the STAI (Z-score 0.66), which classifies them as ""anxious"" and demonstrates a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). Similarly, perceived stress is slightly above average, with a PSS score of 23.0 (Z-score 0.38), aligning with a positive correlation to CES-D (0.28). Self-esteem, measured at 35.0 (Z-score -0.45), is below the population mean, and this measure shows a substantial negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), suggesting lower self-esteem may contribute to increased depressive symptomatology. Interpersonal trust is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.46). Despite these indicators of distress, the participant self-reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.46). Their health satisfaction is near the population mean (Z-score -0.2). Academically, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA across semesters, indicating strong functional performance in this domain.

Sleep patterns present a notable area of disturbance. The participant reports clinically significant poor sleep quality, scoring 9.0 on the PSQI (Z-score 1.05), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed."" This self-reported difficulty is accompanied by wearable data showing a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 35 minutes (Z-score 0.51), indicating sufficient total sleep time. However, sleep duration exhibits above-average variability (123 minutes, Z-score 0.51), suggesting inconsistency in daily sleep length. The median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:23 AM, although the variability in sleep start time is below average (58 minutes, Z-score -0.54), indicating a consistent, albeit delayed, sleep onset. The combination of self-reported disturbed sleep and objective variability in sleep duration, despite adequate total time and consistent onset, points to a potentially disrupted sleep architecture or schedule, which is often associated with mood disturbances.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveal an elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The participant's mean heart rate (Mesor = 83.44 bpm, Z-score 1.3) and resting heart rate (61.7 bpm, Z-score 0.42) are both above the study population average. These metrics both positively correlate with CES-D, suggesting a potential link between higher physiological arousal and depressive symptoms. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is characterized by a high amplitude (15.54, Z-score 1.54) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (0.43, Z-score 0.9), indicating a robust and well-defined daily rhythm. The acrophase, or time of peak heart rate, occurs relatively late at 5:32 PM, consistent with a later daily activity peak. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show typical low points during early morning sleep (e.g., -23.46 bpm from 4-5 AM). However, a distinct and significant dip in heart rate below the mesor is observed during the mid-morning period (e.g., -6.09 bpm from 10-11 AM, Z-score -1.63), followed by a return to baseline around midday. This mid-morning reduction in physiological activity is notably below the population average for that hour and could reflect a period of reduced energy or engagement during typically active hours. The participant's highest physiological activity occurs in the late afternoon, with a peak deviation of 21.85 bpm from 5-6 PM (Z-score 1.65).

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates significantly lower levels of organized physical activity. Frequencies for exercising alone, exercising with others, and participating in sports are all below the population average, with sports participation being particularly low (""Not at all"", Z-score -1.09). Reduced physical activity is frequently associated with an increased risk or exacerbation of depressive symptoms. In terms of substance use, the participant reports above-average consumption of beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreational habits are generally near the population average, with slightly elevated internet usage (Z-score 0.18) and notably less engagement in sedentary hobbies (""Do not do"", Z-score -0.96).

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
*   Significantly elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.66, classified as ""anxious""), which has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D.
*   Self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" according to PSQI (Score 9.0, Z-score 1.05), a clinically significant indicator of poor sleep quality, positively correlated with CES-D.
*   Below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), showing a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D.
*   Slightly above-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score 0.38), positively correlated with CES-D.
*   Significantly low engagement in all forms of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -0.17 to -1.09), a known correlate of higher depressive symptoms.
*   Elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 1.3) and resting heart rate (Z-score 0.42), suggesting higher physiological arousal, both positively correlated with CES-D.
*   Above-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.51), indicating inconsistent sleep, which is often associated with mood disturbances.
*   A notable mid-morning dip in hourly heart rate (10-11 AM, Z-score -1.63), suggesting reduced physiological activity during typical active hours, which could align with symptoms of low energy or anhedonia.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
*   Above-average self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D.
*   Consistently high academic performance (GPA 3.88-3.98).
*   Adequate median total sleep duration (7 hours 35 minutes, Z-score 0.51).
*   Below-average variability in sleep start time (Z-score -0.54), indicating a consistent sleep onset, even if it is late.
*   Slightly below-average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.11) and slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) in heart rate, suggesting relatively stable daily rhythms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a multifaceted picture, but the preponderance of evidence points towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. While some metrics like self-reported happiness, consistent sleep onset, and high GPA might suggest a lower symptom load, these are significantly outweighed by strong indicators of distress. The elevated anxiety, clinically disturbed sleep quality, low self-esteem, and above-average stress are direct self-report measures of mental health and are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores. Furthermore, the objective data from wearables corroborates aspects of poor sleep quality (duration variability) and suggests higher baseline physiological arousal, along with a notable mid-morning dip in activity that could reflect depressive symptomatology. The substantial lack of physical exercise is also a common factor associated with depression. Considering the magnitude and direction of these intercorrelated findings, it is highly probable that the participant experiences a level of depressive symptomatology that places them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

56805,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological measures consistently indicate a favorable profile with respect to mental well-being. Anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI-Trait scale, are exceptionally low (score 20.0, Z-score -2.11), classifying the participant as ""not anxious."" This is a highly protective factor, given its strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, suggesting that lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably high (score 50.0, Z-score 1.66), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.71), further supporting a reduced likelihood of depressive symptomatology. The participant also reports high current happiness (Z-score 1.64) and very high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 2.05), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D. Perceived stress, as assessed by the PSS, is near the population average (score 21.0, Z-score -0.17), implying that stress levels are not a significant contributing factor to heightened depressive symptoms in this individual.

Sleep patterns present a notable dichotomy between subjective experience and objective measurement. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), placing them well within the range of good sleep quality. This good subjective sleep quality correlates positively with CES-D (0.28), indicating that better subjective sleep is associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, objective wearable data reveals a significantly short median sleep duration of 5 hours and 33 minutes (Z-score -2.02), which is notably below the study population average. Despite this short duration, sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability are both near average (Z-scores -0.59 and -0.63, respectively), suggesting a consistent, albeit brief, sleep schedule. No daily naps are reported (Z-score -0.86). The discrepancy between good subjective sleep quality and objectively short sleep duration, particularly given the near-zero correlation of objective sleep duration with CES-D (-0.02), suggests that while sleep duration is low, its direct impact on depressive symptoms as measured by CES-D in this population might be limited for this individual, or that the participant has adapted to this sleep schedule without significant subjective distress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle with minimal substance use. Self-reported substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs) is uniformly ""Not at all,"" with significantly negative Z-scores across all categories. Exercise habits are robust, with frequent engagement in exercising with others (Z-score 1.23) and sports (Z-score 1.58), both reported as ""Three times a week or more."" These activities, especially those involving social interaction, are often associated with improved mental health and are negatively correlated with CES-D (e.g., -0.23 for exercising with others). Conversely, time spent on passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos, internet usage, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies is notably low or non-existent (e.g., Internet Usage Z-score -1.83, Listening to Music Z-score -1.19, Reading Z-score -0.67). Socializing with friends is reported as 31 minutes an hour, which is slightly below average (Z-score -0.62), suggesting a focused engagement in structured, active social interactions over more informal, prolonged social leisure.

Physiological data from wearable devices indicates a robust cardiovascular profile and a well-defined, albeit slightly less stable, circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits a very low resting heart rate of 44.2 BPM (Z-score -1.66) and a low heart rate mesor of 64.45 BPM (Z-score -1.3), both of which are positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), suggesting their low values are indicative of lower depressive symptoms. The heart rate amplitude is average (Z-score -0.01), indicating a normal range of heart rate variation throughout the day. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a clear and pronounced diurnal pattern, with heart rates dropping significantly below the resting heart rate during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, deviation of -30.64 from mesor, reaching approximately 33.81 BPM), signifying deep physiological rest. This is followed by substantial increases in heart rate during waking hours, peaking in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon (e.g., 8-9 AM, deviation of +14.6 from mesor; 3-4 PM, deviation of +14.46 from mesor), consistent with an active daily schedule. The acrophase, or peak time of activity, is observed at 3:10 PM. While intradaily variability is average (Z-score -0.04), interdaily stability, reflecting day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns, is slightly below average (Z-score -0.9). However, the correlation between interdaily stability and CES-D is negligible (-0.01), indicating that this minor irregularity is not significantly associated with depressive symptoms in this study.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Evidence for a relatively low or average CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial and widespread across multiple domains. The participant's self-reported psychological well-being is exceptionally strong, characterized by very low anxiety (STAI Z-score -2.11, high correlation with CES-D of 0.81), very high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 1.66, strong negative correlation -0.71), high happiness (Z-score 1.64, negative correlation -0.46), and high health satisfaction (Z-score 2.05, negative correlation -0.39). Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26, positive correlation 0.28) and average perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.17) further support this profile. Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in exercise, especially social exercise (Z-score 1.23, negative correlation -0.23), and an absence of substance use. Physiologically, a very low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.66) and mesor (Z-score -1.3), both positively correlated with CES-D, suggest good cardiovascular health often associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Evidence for a relatively high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is notably scarce. The most prominent observation that might initially suggest higher symptomatology is the extremely short objective sleep duration (Z-score -2.02). However, this specific metric has a near-zero correlation with CES-D in the study population (-0.02), which significantly diminishes its weight as an indicator for high CES-D in this analysis. Additionally, slightly below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) is also observed, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.01).

Based on the holistic analysis, the overwhelming majority of indicators, particularly those with strong correlations to CES-D (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction, subjective sleep quality, exercise), point towards a participant with very low depressive symptomatology. The few data points that might seem contradictory (e.g., objective short sleep) are either directly contradicted by other favorable measures (e.g., good subjective sleep quality) or have negligible correlation with CES-D in this study population, thus not strongly predicting a higher CES-D score. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the bottom 50% of the study population distribution.

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable strengths in self-perception and physiological health, alongside some areas of reduced engagement in daily activities and below-average self-reported happiness.

Regarding psychological traits, the participant demonstrates significantly higher self-esteem than the study population (Z-score 0.96), a factor strongly and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = -0.71), suggesting it serves as a robust protective attribute. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is near the population average (Z-score -0.13), and despite a ""anxious"" classification, its negative Z-score in conjunction with a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81) implies that for this individual, a slightly lower than average anxiety level would be associated with a reduced depressive symptom burden. However, self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score -0.53), and this metric negatively correlates with CES-D (r = -0.46), indicating that this lower happiness level could contribute to a higher depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is average (Z-score -0.17), while satisfaction with physical health is slightly below average (Z-score -0.2). Academically, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA, indicating strong academic performance.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a selective pattern of activity engagement. While participation in organized sports is higher than average (Z-score 0.91), engagement in exercising alone or with others is notably low (Z-scores -1.18 and -1.58, respectively). This suggests a preference for structured physical activity over independent or casual exercise. Furthermore, the participant reports very low engagement in a range of common recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, and reading, reporting ""Do not do"" for several of these. Engagement in internet usage and socializing with friends is average. This general pattern of low recreational activity, with the exception of sports and moderate social/internet engagement, could reflect a specific lifestyle choice or, in some contexts, could be indicative of reduced interest or anhedonia. Substance use includes above-average consumption of beer and wine/liquor (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94), but no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. The correlations of substance use with CES-D are negligible in this dataset.

Physiologically, the participant displays excellent cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.04) and a below-average mesor (mean heart rate over 24 hours, Z-score -0.91). Both lower resting heart rate and mesor show a positive correlation with CES-D, suggesting these lower values are associated with reduced depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate slightly below-average interdaily stability and intradaily variability, implying somewhat less consistent daily patterns in heart rate activity. However, a higher-than-average autocorrelation at 24 hours suggests an underlying rhythmic consistency. The circadian amplitude is lower than average (Z-score -0.9), potentially indicating less pronounced daily heart rate fluctuations. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of physiological arousal: a pronounced and significantly above-average peak occurs during the late morning hours (9-11 AM), particularly from 9-10 AM (Z-score 2.2), followed by sustained elevated heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak of the fitted cosinor rhythm, is estimated at 4:08 PM, which is later than the observed strongest heart rate deviation peak, suggesting a complex daily pattern that may not be fully captured by a simple sinusoidal model. Sleep patterns, both self-reported and objectively measured, appear generally healthy. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5, Z-score -0.8), which is a protective factor. Objective data show average total sleep duration (7 hours 14 minutes) with slightly above-average consistency in duration. While the median sleep start time is late (01:28:38) with slightly less consistency, these factors do not appear to compromise overall sleep quality or duration for this individual.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on a holistic analysis of the available multimodal data, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would likely place them in the **bottom 50%** of the study population distribution.

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial. The participant exhibits significantly high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96, strong negative correlation with CES-D), which is a powerful protective factor against depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI Z-score -0.8), a key indicator of well-being often inversely related to depression. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular health, with a significantly low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.04) and a low 24-hour mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.91), both of which are positively correlated with CES-D, implying lower values contribute to lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, despite an ""anxious"" classification for STAI, the participant's STAI Z-score (-0.13) is slightly below the population average, and given its strong positive correlation with CES-D, this suggests a propensity for lower CES-D for this individual. High academic achievement (GPA) and high engagement in sports (Z-score 0.91, negative correlation with CES-D) also align with a profile less prone to high depressive symptomatology. Low use of recreational drugs (negative Z-scores, positive correlation with CES-D) further supports a lower CES-D score.

Conversely, some factors suggest potential risk for elevated CES-D. The participant reports below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, negative correlation with CES-D), which is a moderate risk factor. Additionally, significantly low engagement in non-sporting exercise and several recreational activities could be interpreted as a slight risk, although specific correlations for these activities are generally weak in this dataset. The slightly below-average amplitude of circadian heart rate (Z-score -0.9, negative correlation with CES-D) also slightly leans towards a higher CES-D.

Weighing the evidence, the highly significant protective factors, particularly high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, superior physiological health metrics (RHR, Mesor), and slightly below-average trait anxiety (relative to the population mean), appear to strongly outweigh the more moderate risk factors related to lower happiness and reduced engagement in some leisure activities. Therefore, the combined evidence strongly indicates a CES-D score that would fall within the lower half of the study population distribution.

47142,19.0,0.7616580310880829,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by specific psychological vulnerabilities, distinct behavioral habits, and a highly regular, yet physiologically elevated, circadian rhythm. Psychologically, there is evidence of slightly elevated trait anxiety (Z-score 0.17), which is strongly positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Concurrently, self-reported self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), happiness (Z-score -0.53), interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46), and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95) are all below the population average. These lower scores are consistently and moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D, indicating a potential link to increased depressive symptom burden. Despite these indicators, the participant reports lower-than-average perceived stress (Z-score -0.44), although this measure has only a weak positive correlation with CES-D.

Behaviorally, the participant reports very good subjective sleep quality, as evidenced by a significantly low PSQI score (Z-score -1.26). However, objective wearable data indicates a shorter median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes (Z-score -0.81) and a notably high frequency of daily napping (Z-score 2.66), suggesting that the participant may be compensating for insufficient nocturnal sleep. The participant demonstrates minimal engagement in substance use, reporting ""not at all"" across all surveyed categories. Social interaction appears significantly limited, with very low reported time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) and no participation in exercise with others or sports. Conversely, the participant exercises alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32) and spends less time than average on screen-based recreational activities.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicate a highly robust and stable heart rate-based circadian rhythm. This regularity is reflected in high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.08), low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.31), and a strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.48). However, the participant's average heart rate (Mesor: 83.59 BPM, Z-score 1.32) and resting heart rate (65.1 BPM, Z-score 0.83) are both elevated relative to the study population, albeit with weak positive correlations to CES-D. The hourly deviation from the mesor demonstrates a typical daily pattern: heart rate decreases significantly below the mesor during early morning hours, reaching values near or slightly below the resting heart rate (e.g., -22.67 BPM from mesor at 4-5 AM, approximately 60.92 BPM), consistent with sleep. Heart rate then progressively rises, peaking in the late afternoon or early evening (Acrophase at 5:06 PM) at approximately 97.84 BPM. This pattern indicates a well-entrained, yet overall elevated, physiological arousal state.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The most substantial evidence for an elevated depressive symptom burden comes from several self-reported psychological measures that are strongly or moderately correlated with the CES-D score. The participant's slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17) is strongly positively correlated with CES-D (r=0.81). Furthermore, significantly lower self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.45, r=-0.71), lower reported happiness (Z-score -0.53, r=-0.46), and lower health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95, r=-0.39) all align with higher CES-D scores based on their respective strong to moderate negative correlations. Lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46, r=-0.41) also contributes to this pattern. Behaviorally, the significantly reduced time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) is a common manifestation of social withdrawal often associated with depression, despite a weak direct correlation with CES-D. Objectively, short sleep duration and frequent napping, while not strongly correlated, could suggest underlying fatigue or sleep disruption contributing to overall distress. The elevated Mesor and Resting Heart Rate, even with weak positive correlations, may suggest a baseline physiological state of heightened activation.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Conversely, several factors suggest a lower or average CES-D score. The participant reports excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26), which is generally a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Lower perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.44), though weakly correlated (r=0.28), typically aligns with better mental well-being. The participant engages in minimal substance use, which is a positive health indicator. Furthermore, the wearable data demonstrates exceptionally strong and regular heart rate-based circadian rhythms (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability, high Autocorrelation), suggesting a well-structured physiological routine that is generally considered beneficial for mental health. Consistent high academic performance (GPA) also suggests functional capacity.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits several positive indicators such as good subjective sleep quality, low perceived stress, minimal substance use, and highly stable physiological rhythms, these are counterbalanced by prominent psychological vulnerabilities. The strong correlations of self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction, and trait anxiety with CES-D, coupled with the participant's scores consistently falling in the direction associated with higher depressive symptomatology for these measures, carry significant weight. The marked social withdrawal further strengthens the interpretation of an elevated symptom burden. Therefore, despite the presence of structured routines and perceived good sleep, the aggregate evidence from trait measures strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the higher half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
60396,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile, showing both areas of resilience and potential vulnerability. Psychologically, while trait anxiety is within the average range (STAI Z=0.07), its strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81) suggests that even typical levels could be relevant to depressive symptoms. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably below the population average (RSES Z=-0.73), a finding with a substantial negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71), indicating a propensity towards elevated depressive symptoms. Counteracting these, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z=0.55, r=-0.46) and health satisfaction (Z=0.88, r=-0.39), both of which are negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are slightly below average (PSS Z=-0.17), and interpersonal trust is remarkably high (Z=1.15), correlating moderately with lower CES-D (r=-0.41). Academically, a consistent decline in GPA across three semesters (from 3.62 to 3.33) might signal increasing academic challenges or reduced engagement.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption but abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are robust, particularly exercising with others, occurring three times a week or more (Z=1.23), a highly beneficial social and physical activity moderately correlated with lower CES-D scores (r=-0.23). However, there is notably low engagement in several other recreational activities, including listening to music (Z=-1.19) and reading (Z=-0.67). Internet usage is also substantially below average (Z=-1.16). Socializing with friends is reported as below average (Z=-0.62), which could suggest a specific pattern of social engagement, contrasting with the high frequency of exercising with others. The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates self-reported disturbed sleep, though the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 suggests this self-reported sleep quality is actually better than the average within the study population.

Physiologically, wearable data reveals a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm, characterized by significantly low intradaily variability (Z=-1.45) and a notably high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z=1.57), indicative of predictable daily physiological patterns. The mesor heart rate (Z=-1.11) and resting heart rate (Z=-1.04) are both substantially lower than the population average, suggesting strong cardiovascular health and efficiency. The acrophase, or peak activity time, is observed at 5:52 PM, consistent with typical diurnal rhythms. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a normal pattern of physiological arousal, with the lowest rates during early morning sleep and peak activation in the late evening, demonstrating healthy physiological regulation without evidence of chronic hyper- or hypo-arousal. Objective sleep metrics from the wearable device corroborate a consistent sleep-wake cycle: median sleep duration is slightly above average (7 hours 23 minutes, Z=0.26), and both sleep duration and sleep start times exhibit lower-than-average variability (Z=-0.69 and Z=-0.66, respectively), reinforcing a consistent and stable sleep schedule. This objective consistency in sleep and circadian rhythm largely mitigates the severity of the self-reported 'disturbed sleep' from the PSQI, suggesting the participant maintains a strong physiological foundation.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

To assess the participant's likely position within the study population's CES-D score distribution, we weigh the cumulative evidence against the median CES-D score of 11.5.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits several robust indicators associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness (Z=0.55, r=-0.46), high interpersonal trust (Z=1.15, r=-0.41), and elevated health satisfaction (Z=0.88, r=-0.39) are all positively skewed and negatively correlated with CES-D, suggesting a reduced symptom burden. Behaviorally, regular and socially-engaged exercise (Z=1.23 for exercising with others, r=-0.23) is a significant protective factor. Physiologically, the wearable data presents a strong picture of resilience: an exceptionally stable and regular circadian rhythm (low intradaily variability Z=-1.45, high 24-hour autocorrelation Z=1.57), remarkably low mesor and resting heart rates (Z=-1.11 and Z=-1.04), and objectively consistent sleep patterns (low variability in duration and start time). These physiological markers are strongly indicative of a well-regulated system typically associated with better mental health outcomes. Furthermore, despite self-reporting ""disturbed sleep"" via PSQI, the participant's PSQI Z-score is better than the population average, and objective sleep metrics demonstrate good consistency, suggesting that any sleep disturbance is not indicative of severe irregularity often seen in elevated depressive states. Low internet usage (Z=-1.16) also weakly correlates with lower CES-D (r=0.25).

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (top 50%):**
Conversely, some psychological factors suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptoms. The participant's below-average self-esteem (Z=-0.73) with a strong negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.71) is a significant indicator. While trait anxiety is average (Z=0.07), its notably strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81) implies that even this typical level could contribute to a higher symptom burden. The observed decline in GPA across academic semesters could be a behavioral manifestation of underlying distress or reduced functioning. Additionally, significantly low engagement in certain recreational activities, such as listening to music (Z=-1.19) and reading (Z=-0.67), alongside below-average socializing with friends (Z=-0.62), could suggest some anhedonia or social withdrawal, though the correlations with CES-D for these specific activities are generally weak or negligible.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant's profile presents a dichotomy. While low self-esteem and the strong correlation of average anxiety with CES-D point towards a higher depressive symptom burden, these are substantially counterbalanced by a wealth of positive indicators. The participant demonstrates above-average happiness, trust, and health satisfaction. Crucially, their physiological data, including robust circadian rhythmicity, low resting heart rate, and objectively consistent sleep patterns, suggests a resilient biological foundation. Combined with consistent engagement in social exercise, these strong physiological and behavioral protective factors appear to outweigh the psychological vulnerabilities. The objective consistency in sleep and physiological regulation largely mitigates the subjective report of disturbed sleep. Considering the cumulative strength and number of positive indicators—especially the profound physiological regulation and positive health behaviors—it is more likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the bottom half of the study population's CES-D distribution.

92412,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a comprehensive profile indicative of robust psychological well-being, adaptive lifestyle behaviors, and consistent physiological rhythms. Self-report measures reveal significantly low trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 32.0 (Z-score -0.92), placing them well below the population average. This is further supported by a high self-esteem score of 44.0 (Z-score 0.82), a high self-reported happiness level of 5.0 (Z-score 1.64), and notably low perceived stress, reflected by a PSS score of 16.0 (Z-score -1.53). The participant also reports above-average satisfaction with their physical health (Score 5.11, Z-score 0.63) and consistently maintains a perfect 4.0 GPA across multiple academic semesters, suggesting strong academic functioning and resilience. Furthermore, engagement in substance use is reported as ""not at all"" across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs), with consistently low negative Z-scores, indicating abstinence from these substances relative to the study population.

Sleep patterns for this participant are highly consistent and indicative of good quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26) classifies their subjective sleep as ""Good Sleep."" Objective wearable data corroborates this, showing an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes (Z-score 0.76). Crucially, both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit significantly low variability, with standard deviations of 62 minutes (Z-score -0.87) and 49 minutes (Z-score -0.74) respectively. This indicates a highly regular and stable sleep schedule. Additionally, the participant reports no daily napping (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86), which often correlates with consolidated nocturnal sleep.

Physiological data from wearables highlights an active lifestyle and a well-regulated cardiovascular system. The participant exhibits a low resting heart rate of 53.0 bpm (Z-score -0.61) and a lower-than-average Mesor (mean heart rate) of 67.41 bpm (Z-score -0.89), both suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Their heart rate-based circadian rhythm is robust, indicated by an above-average amplitude of 13.08 (Z-score 0.74) and a typical acrophase occurring at 6:03 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals pronounced peaks in cardiovascular activity, particularly between 5-6 PM (Value 39.22, Z-score 4.19) and 6-7 PM (Value 25.03, Z-score 2.17), aligning with significant physical exertion. These objective findings are consistent with self-reported high frequencies of exercise, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports (all at or above ""Three times a week or more,"" with positive Z-scores).

In terms of daily recreational habits, the participant reports relatively low engagement in several sedentary activities such as video games, reading, internet usage, and listening to music, which are all below the population average (negative Z-scores). Socializing with friends is also reported at a lower frequency (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41) compared to the population. While lower engagement in some social activities might sometimes be a concern, in this case, it appears to be contextualized by high levels of physical activity (including exercising with others) and strong overall psychological and academic performance, suggesting a prioritization of active pursuits over passive or highly social recreational time, rather than social withdrawal. The participant's interdaily stability of heart rate is average (Z-score 0.17), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.81), which, combined with high activity, could reflect dynamic engagement throughout the day.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial and consistent evidence to suggest that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
A preponderance of evidence strongly points to lower depressive symptomatology. The STAI-Trait score, a measure of anxiety proneness, is notably low (Z-score -0.92) and has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), indicating that lower anxiety is associated with lower CES-D. Conversely, the participant's high Self-Esteem score (Z-score 0.82) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), further reinforcing the likelihood of a low CES-D score. High self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) and very low perceived stress (Z-score -1.53), both of which are correlated with CES-D in a protective direction, provide additional psychological indicators. Objective and self-reported sleep metrics are exceptional, with good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26), above-average sleep duration (Z-score 0.76), and significantly stable sleep patterns (low standard deviations for sleep duration and start time, Z-scores -0.87 and -0.74 respectively). High levels of physical exercise across multiple categories, alongside low resting heart rate and a robust heart rate circadian rhythm (high amplitude), represent strong physiological and behavioral protective factors against depression. Academic excellence (consistent 4.0 GPA) and complete abstinence from substance use further align with a profile of overall well-being.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
There is very limited and minor evidence that might, in isolation, suggest a higher CES-D score, but these are significantly outweighed by the countervailing evidence. The participant's self-reported socializing with friends is lower than average (Z-score -1.41); however, the correlation of this metric with CES-D is negligible (-0.02), making it a weak indicator. The trust score is slightly below average (Z-score -0.46), and its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41) means lower trust could be associated with higher CES-D. However, this is a modest deviation from the mean and is eclipsed by the multitude of strong positive psychological traits. The slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.81) in heart rate has a weak negative correlation (-0.05) with CES-D and, in the context of high physical activity, is not indicative of distress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The holistic analysis reveals a remarkably consistent and robust pattern of psychological resilience, adaptive health behaviors, excellent sleep hygiene, and strong physical fitness. The overwhelming majority of indicators, particularly those with strong correlations to CES-D (e.g., anxiety, self-esteem, stress, happiness), firmly place the participant in a low-risk category for depressive symptomatology. The consistent positive self-report scores, coupled with objective wearable data confirming healthy physiological and behavioral rhythms, paint a clear picture. The few minor deviations from the population mean (e.g., lower social engagement, slightly lower trust) are either weakly correlated with CES-D or comprehensively overshadowed by the numerous and significant indicators of well-being. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls into the lower half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
92038,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a notably positive psychological profile across several self-reported measures. Trait anxiety, as indicated by the STAI score, is low (Z-score -1.02, falling into the ""not anxious"" classification). Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-Score 1.66) and current happiness (Z-Score 1.64) are significantly above the population average. Perceived stress levels are reported to be below average (Z-Score -0.44), and satisfaction with physical health is high (Z-score 1.3). These self-reported psychological indicators, which largely exhibit strong negative correlations with CES-D scores, collectively suggest a resilient psychological state and contribute to a reduced likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. The participant also maintains consistently high academic performance, with GPAs ranging from 3.6 to 4.0.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, reporting frequent exercise both alone and, notably, with others (Z-Score 1.23). This engagement in social exercise correlates moderately negatively with CES-D scores. Conversely, engagement in passive screen-based recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos, playing video games, and general internet usage, is significantly lower than the study population average (Z-scores ranging from -0.56 to -1.25). These activities typically show positive correlations with CES-D scores, suggesting that the participant's low engagement may act as a protective behavioral pattern. Furthermore, the participant dedicates above-average time to reading (Z-Score 1.3). While alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor) is reported as moderately above average, the correlations with CES-D scores are negligible. Overall, the participant's activity profile suggests a preference for active and cognitively engaging behaviors over more sedentary options.

Regarding sleep characteristics, the participant's self-reported subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is slightly better than the population average (Z-Score -0.33), despite the categorical classification of ""Disturbed Sleep."" Wearable data indicates an adequate median sleep duration of 7 hours and 36 minutes (Z-Score 0.52). However, a notable aspect of the participant's sleep pattern is the above-average variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 1.0) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.69). These variabilities in sleep schedule and duration show positive correlations with CES-D scores, potentially indicating a factor associated with increased depressive symptoms. The absence of regular napping (Z-Score -0.86) is also observed.

Analysis of heart rate data reveals a relatively low resting heart rate (53.4 bpm, Z-Score -0.56), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is average, and the heart rate circadian rhythm exhibits a robust amplitude (Z-Score 0.99), signifying a clear distinction between periods of activity and rest. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:12 PM. However, the circadian rhythm shows above-average intradaily variability (Z-Score 1.23) and slightly below-average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, suggesting some daily irregularity in heart rate patterns, though correlations with CES-D are negligible for these specific metrics. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a pronounced diurnal rhythm, with significant drops below the mesor during typical nighttime hours (e.g., -22.66 bpm from 4-5 AM) and substantial elevations during the day, particularly in the late afternoon (e.g., 25.31 bpm from 4-5 PM, Z-Score 2.45), indicating periods of considerable physiological activity.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile, including the median):**
The strongest evidence for a low or median CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. They exhibit significantly low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.02), very high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 1.66, with a strong negative correlation of -0.71 with CES-D), very high reported happiness (Z-score 1.64, with a moderate negative correlation of -0.46), and below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.44, with a positive correlation of 0.28, implying lower stress is beneficial). High satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3, correlation -0.39) further supports a positive overall outlook. These factors are consistently and robustly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Behaviorally, the participant's high engagement in exercise, especially with others (Z-score 1.23, correlation -0.23), and remarkably low engagement in sedentary screen-based activities (Z-scores ranging from -0.56 to -1.25, with generally positive correlations with CES-D) are also indicators of protective behaviors. Physiologically, a healthy, below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56, correlation 0.19) and a strong circadian amplitude suggest good physiological regulation, which typically aligns with better mental health.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The primary evidence that might suggest a higher CES-D score stems from sleep and circadian rhythm variability. While median sleep duration is adequate and self-reported sleep quality is slightly better than average, objective wearable data indicates above-average variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 1.0, correlation 0.2) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.69, correlation 0.22). Higher variability in these sleep parameters is positively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting a potential link to increased depressive symptomatology. Additionally, heart rate data shows above-average intradaily variability (Z-score 1.23) and slightly below-average interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation. While the correlations for these specific circadian rhythm metrics are negligible with CES-D, increased physiological variability and reduced rhythm regularity can sometimes be observed in depressive states.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The collective evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score. The numerous and robust positive indicators from self-reported psychological well-being (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, low stress, high health satisfaction) and beneficial behavioral habits (frequent exercise, low screen time, high reading) outweigh the concerns raised by sleep and circadian rhythm variability. While sleep and heart rate variability are noted, the substantial protective factors, particularly in the psychological domain with strong correlations to lower CES-D, point towards relatively low or average depressive symptomatology.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile suggests a favorable overall well-being, consistently pointing towards a lower burden of depressive symptoms. Anxiety levels, as measured by the STAI, are classified as ""not anxious"" with a Z-score of -0.33, indicating below-average anxiety. This is a significant finding given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D scores. Similarly, self-esteem, while slightly below the population mean with a Z-score of -0.17, remains high with an absolute score of 37 out of 40, which strongly suggests a lower CES-D score due to its high negative correlation (-0.71). Further supporting this trend, the participant reports notably higher happiness (Z-score 0.55) and considerably lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.71) compared to the study population, both of which correlate negatively and positively with CES-D, respectively. Interpersonal trust is also above average (Z-score 0.5), which tends to be associated with lower depressive symptoms. The only self-report aspect that might weakly suggest an elevated CES-D is a slightly below-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.12), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D. However, the magnitude of this deviation is minor in comparison to the other robust indicators of psychological health.

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" and a clinically significant level of sleep difficulty, objective Fitbit data reveals relatively consistent sleep habits. The participant averages 7 hours and 1 minute of sleep per night, which is within a healthy range, albeit slightly below the population mean. Crucially, variability in both nightly sleep duration (standard deviation 94 minutes, Z-score -0.15) and sleep start time (standard deviation 51 minutes, Z-score -0.7) is lower than average, suggesting a high degree of regularity in their sleep schedule. Furthermore, the absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) is often indicative of sufficient nocturnal sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data reinforce this regularity, with a higher-than-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.48), reflecting a robust and consistent daily physiological rhythm. This suggests that while subjective sleep quality is perceived as poor, the underlying sleep architecture and regularity, as measured objectively, are well-maintained.

The participant's physiological arousal and daily activity patterns, derived from wearable data, depict a profile of robust cardiovascular health and active engagement. Both the overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 64.67 bpm, Z-score -1.27) and resting heart rate (51.0 bpm, Z-score -0.85) are significantly below the population average. This is a strong indicator of good cardiovascular fitness, which typically correlates with lower physiological stress and improved mental well-being; both metrics show a positive correlation with CES-D, meaning lower values like these predict lower depressive symptoms. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a clear and pronounced diurnal rhythm, with a substantial peak in activity during the afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM deviation +13.65 bpm, Z-score 1.22). This robust physiological response aligns with self-reported consistent participation in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91), contrasting with lower engagement in solitary or general group exercise. Furthermore, the participant reports very low or no usage of substances across all categories, which aligns with generally positive health behaviors. These combined physiological and behavioral markers of fitness and activity are generally associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms.

In terms of social and recreational engagement, the participant engages in social activities around the population average, reporting 1-2 hours of socializing with friends daily. Digital media consumption (internet usage, video games, TV/movies) is also within or slightly above the average range. While reading is notably low (""Do not do,"" Z-score -0.67), overall engagement in leisure activities does not indicate significant withdrawal. Academic performance, as evidenced by a consistently high GPA (3.7-3.75), also suggests a well-adjusted individual in their academic environment. These behavioral patterns do not present any strong indicators of social withdrawal or anhedonia often associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The overwhelming majority of self-report and objective metrics strongly suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits very low anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33, strong positive correlation with CES-D: 0.81), high self-esteem (score 37, strong negative correlation with CES-D: -0.71), higher-than-average happiness (Z-score 0.55, moderate negative correlation: -0.46), and significantly lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.71, moderate positive correlation: 0.28). Trust is also above average (Z-score 0.5, moderate negative correlation: -0.41). Physiologically, the participant demonstrates excellent cardiovascular health with a significantly low Mesor heart rate (Z-score -1.27, moderate positive correlation: 0.19) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.85, moderate positive correlation: 0.19). Objective sleep data shows high consistency in sleep duration (Z-score -0.15 for standard deviation, weak positive correlation: 0.2) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.7 for standard deviation, moderate positive correlation: 0.22), along with no reported naps (Z-score -0.86, moderate positive correlation: 0.21), all indicating better sleep hygiene and implicitly lower CES-D. Robust circadian rhythm (Autocorrelation at 24 hours Z-score 0.48) further supports this. Behavioral patterns such as high sports participation (Z-score 0.91, weak negative correlation: -0.15) and very low substance use also align with a profile of lower depressive symptomatology. The high GPA further suggests adaptive functioning.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The primary piece of evidence for elevated depressive symptoms comes from the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, which classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" While the Z-score for this metric is only slightly above average (0.13), a score above 5 is commonly indicative of clinically significant sleep disturbance, a known symptom of depression. A minor indicator is slightly below-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.12), which carries a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting that lower satisfaction could be associated with higher CES-D. However, the magnitude of this deviation is very small.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the entirety of the data, the overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a CES-D score in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The strong and consistent indicators across self-reported psychological states (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, low stress, high trust) and objective physiological markers (excellent cardiovascular health, regular and robust circadian rhythms, consistent sleep habits) collectively paint a picture of an individual with robust mental and physical well-being. The single prominent counter-indicator, disturbed sleep as measured by the PSQI, is significant, but it is largely offset by objective sleep metrics that suggest strong regularity, implying that the perceived disturbance might be qualitative or not indicative of broad and severe sleep dysregulation that would typically accompany high depressive symptom burden. Given the strength and number of variables pointing to lower depressive symptoms, the participant's profile is far more consistent with a relatively low or average CES-D score.

29792,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"The participant’s multimodal data reveal a complex interplay of psychological, physiological, and behavioral patterns relevant to depressive symptoms.

**Psychological Traits and Mental Well-being:**
The participant reports a generally positive psychological profile on several measures, yet exhibits a key area of vulnerability. Self-esteem (score 40.0, Z=0.26), current happiness (score 4.0, Z=0.55), health satisfaction (score 4.56, Z=0.22), and interpersonal trust (score 3.67, Z=0.83) are all reported as notably higher than the study population average. These traits correlate negatively with CES-D, suggesting they may act as protective factors. Perceived stress (score 21.0, Z=-0.17) is slightly below average, also aligning with potentially lower depressive symptoms. However, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is classified as ""anxious"" (score 43.0, Z=0.17) and shows a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores in the study population. This indicates that despite other positive attributes, a propensity for anxiety is a significant psychological feature for this participant and is a strong risk factor for elevated depressive symptoms.

**Sleep Patterns:**
Sleep patterns are a significant area of concern for this participant. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z=0.13) classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicating subjective difficulties. Objectively, Fitbit data confirms a median sleep duration of only 6 hours 11 minutes, which is substantially below the population average (Z=-1.25). Most strikingly, the median sleep start time is exceptionally late at 04:31:59 AM, suggesting a severe and prolonged delay in their sleep-wake schedule. While the variability in sleep duration (Z=0.15) and sleep start time (Z=-0.37) is relatively close to the population average, the combination of objectively short sleep and extreme circadian misalignment represents a substantial disruption that is typically associated with negative impacts on mood and daily functioning.

**Circadian Rhythm and Physiological Arousal:**
Analysis of heart rate data reveals patterns consistent with a significantly delayed circadian rhythm. While the overall amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is typical, the acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs notably late at 7:39 PM. The participant exhibits reduced day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns, as indicated by a lower-than-average 24-hour autocorrelation (value 0.19, Z=-1.12). Despite these disruptions, the participant's resting heart rate (52.0 bpm, Z=-0.73) and mesor heart rate (69.94 bpm, Z=-0.55) are below population averages, suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a distinct pattern of high physiological arousal during the evening (peaking significantly at 7-8 PM with a deviation of 23.64 bpm, Z=2.12) and very low arousal during conventional morning hours (e.g., 7-10 AM, with deviations significantly below mesor), which strongly aligns with their reported late sleep start time and delayed activity schedule.

**Behavioral Habits:**
The participant's behavioral habits present a mixed profile. There is notably higher substance use across several categories, with beer consumption reported ""Three times a week or more"" (Z=1.72), wine or liquor ""1-2 times a week"" (Z=0.94), and recreational drugs ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" (Z=1.61). These levels are significantly above the population average. In contrast, the participant is highly physically active, engaging in exercise with others ""Three times a week or more"" (Z=1.23) and sports ""1-2 times a week"" (Z=0.91), both of which are reported at above-average frequencies and correlate negatively with CES-D. Recreational habits indicate significant engagement in screen-based sedentary activities, such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z=1.28) and video games (31 minutes an hour, Z=1.71), both considerably above average. Socializing with friends is reported at an average frequency (1-2 hours, Z=0.16).

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score:**
Evidence suggesting a relatively low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) includes significantly higher self-esteem (Z=0.26, correlation -0.71), higher current happiness (Z=0.55, correlation -0.46), higher interpersonal trust (Z=0.83, correlation -0.41), and slightly lower perceived stress (Z=-0.17, correlation 0.28). Furthermore, the participant engages in significantly more physical activity, particularly with others and in sports, both of which are associated with lower CES-D scores (Z=1.23, correlation -0.23; Z=0.91, correlation -0.15, respectively). Physiologically, a lower resting and mesor heart rate are also associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Conversely, strong evidence points towards an elevated CES-D score (top 50th percentile). The most prominent factor is the ""anxious"" classification on the STAI with a very high positive correlation (0.81) to CES-D, indicating a significant predisposition to anxiety that is strongly linked to depressive symptoms. Compounding this is severe sleep disturbance, characterized by a PSQI score of 7.0 (""Disturbed Sleep"") and an objectively short median sleep duration (6 hours 11 minutes, Z=-1.25). Critically, the participant exhibits an extremely late median sleep start time (04:31:59 AM) and reduced day-to-day regularity in heart rate rhythms (24-hour autocorrelation Z=-1.12), indicating a major disruption in circadian alignment, which is a known risk factor and symptom of mood disorders. Additionally, significantly elevated substance use across multiple categories, while having low correlations in this specific dataset, generally constitutes a risk factor or comorbidity for depression.

Holistic analysis indicates that while several self-reported protective factors like high self-esteem and physical activity are present, these appear to be significantly counterbalanced by the substantial trait anxiety, severe and chronically disrupted sleep patterns (particularly the pronounced circadian phase delay), and elevated substance use. The strong positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D, coupled with the profound objective sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, suggests a significant burden of depressive symptomatology. The objective physiological evidence of a shifted and less regular circadian rhythm provides further support for a compromised mental health state despite otherwise healthy cardiovascular metrics. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

14737,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of potential concern. The STAI-Trait score of 45.0, classified as ""anxious"" with a Z-score of 0.37, suggests above-average chronic anxiety, a trait strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (r=0.81). Concurrently, the participant reports lower self-esteem (Z=-0.59) and lower interpersonal trust (Z=-0.78) compared to the study population, both of which are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.71 and r=-0.41, respectively). Additionally, satisfaction with physical health is reported as lower than average (Z=-0.53, r=-0.39 with CES-D). These patterns suggest a psychological disposition that is generally more vulnerable to depressive symptomatology. Contradictory to these trends, the participant self-reports above-average happiness (Z=0.55) and below-average perceived stress (Z=-0.44), factors which are typically associated with lower CES-D scores (happiness r=-0.46; stress r=0.28). This suggests a nuanced psychological state where general well-being reports might not fully align with underlying trait anxiety and self-esteem vulnerabilities.

Both subjective and objective sleep measures highlight significant disturbances. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0, while presenting a Z-score of -0.33 (indicating slightly better than average sleep quality *relative to the study population*), still categorizes their sleep as ""disturbed"" by clinical standards (score above 5). Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a markedly short median sleep duration of 6 hours 3 minutes, with a highly negative Z-score of -1.41 compared to the population, indicating substantial sleep deprivation. Furthermore, the participant exhibits considerable irregularity in their sleep patterns, demonstrated by a high standard deviation in sleep duration (133 minutes, Z=0.74) and an even greater variability in sleep start times (135 minutes, Z=1.14). Both high variability in sleep duration and start time show positive correlations with CES-D scores (r=0.20 and r=0.22, respectively). These objective metrics, combined with the subjective report of disturbed sleep, point towards a fragmented and insufficient sleep schedule, which is a common feature associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

The participant's engagement in physical and social activities is notably low. Exercise habits are below the population average, particularly for exercising with others (Z=-1.58) and engaging in sports (Z=-1.09), both of which have negative (though weak) correlations with CES-D, suggesting lower participation may align with higher depressive symptoms. Socializing with friends is also reported at a very low frequency (16-30 minutes daily, Z=-1.41), indicating limited social engagement compared to peers. While the participant abstains from substance use, daily recreation patterns show a high engagement in a sedentary hobby (1-2 hours, Z=1.41) and relatively high video game usage (16-30 minutes, Z=0.96). This combination of reduced physical activity and social interaction, alongside increased sedentary leisure, may contribute to a lifestyle that is less protective against depressive symptoms. The participant's GPA has also shown a decline from 3.73 in Spring 2016 to 3.1 in Fall 2016, which might indicate academic or personal challenges over the semester.

Analysis of heart rate data reveals a moderately robust but also somewhat fragmented circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (Z=0.33) is slightly above average, suggesting some consistency in daily patterns, and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Z=0.53) is above average, indicating a clear distinction between active and rest periods. However, the Intradaily Variability (Z=0.67) is higher than average, which may suggest a less smooth or more fragmented pattern of activity and rest throughout the day. The participant's acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:54 PM. The resting heart rate of 54.2 bpm (Z=-0.47) is below the population average, generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness and lower physiological stress. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a typical diurnal pattern with lowest rates during the early morning hours, consistent with sleep. Notably, there is a substantial increase in heart rate deviation in the early evening, peaking very significantly between 6-7 PM (Z=1.65), indicating a period of high physiological arousal or activity at this time relative to the population. This pronounced evening peak, followed by a gradual decline, suggests sustained activity or heightened state into the evening hours.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Strong evidence suggests the participant likely has a CES-D score in the top half of the study population. Key indicators include a high self-reported trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.37, classified as ""anxious,"" with a strong correlation of 0.81 to CES-D) and significantly lower self-esteem (Z=-0.59, with a strong negative correlation of -0.71 to CES-D). Objective sleep data is particularly compelling, showing markedly short median sleep duration (Z=-1.41) and very high variability in both sleep duration (Z=0.74) and sleep start times (Z=1.14), with both variability metrics positively correlating with CES-D. Subjectively, sleep is classified as ""disturbed"" (PSQI score of 6.0). Behavioral patterns also align with elevated symptomatology, including very low social engagement (Z=-1.41) and significantly reduced exercise, especially with others (Z=-1.58, correlated -0.23 with CES-D). Lower trust (Z=-0.78) and lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.53) further support this, given their negative correlations with CES-D. The notable decline in GPA over academic semesters could also be a behavioral manifestation of underlying distress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, some data points suggest a potentially lower or average CES-D score. The participant self-reports above-average happiness (Z=0.55) and below-average perceived stress (Z=-0.44), which typically correlate negatively with CES-D (meaning higher happiness and lower stress are associated with lower CES-D). Physically, the participant exhibits a below-average resting heart rate (Z=-0.47), which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness and lower physiological stress, and has a positive correlation (0.19) with CES-D (meaning lower RHR is associated with lower CES-D). The circadian rhythm, while showing some fragmentation (Intradaily Variability Z=0.67), also demonstrates slightly above-average Interdaily Stability (Z=0.33) and a robust amplitude (Z=0.53), suggesting underlying physiological rhythmicity is not entirely disrupted. The participant also completely abstains from substance use, which is a healthy behavior.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While there are conflicting signals, the weight of evidence leans strongly towards a higher CES-D score. The self-reported psychological vulnerabilities (anxiety, self-esteem, trust) show strong correlations with CES-D and are significantly outside the population mean. Crucially, the objective sleep data reveals profound disturbances in duration and regularity, which are core symptoms of depression and strongly supported by their extreme Z-scores. The very low social engagement and reduced exercise further align with a depressive profile. The self-reported higher happiness and lower stress, while notable, may not fully capture the overall symptom burden, particularly when contrasted with objective behavioral patterns and strong trait-level vulnerabilities. The strength of the correlations for the indicators pointing towards a higher CES-D score, combined with the extreme deviations in objective sleep metrics and social behavior, outweigh the more favorable self-reported happiness and stress levels. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall into the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
28653,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The participant presents a comprehensive profile indicative of robust psychological and physiological well-being, with several key indicators suggesting a low burden of depressive symptoms. Across self-report measures, the participant demonstrates a strong positive psychological outlook, scoring notably low on anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.22) and remarkably high on self-esteem (Z-score 1.52), current happiness (Z-score 1.64), interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.79), and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.63). These traits are consistently associated with lower depressive symptoms, as evidenced by their moderate to strong negative correlations with CES-D scores. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score -0.17).

In terms of sleep, both subjective and objective data indicate good quality and sufficient duration. The participant reports ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), falling well below the clinical threshold for sleep disturbance. Wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 4 minutes (Z-score 1.1), which is above the population average. While sleep start time variability is slightly above average, the overall picture points to healthy and restorative sleep patterns.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics further reinforce a profile of good health and strong regulatory capacity. The participant exhibits a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm, characterized by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.41) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.4), alongside very low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -2.08). The circadian rhythm also displays a very high amplitude (Z-score 2.26), reflecting a significant and healthy difference between peak and trough heart rates throughout the day. The mean aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a clear and robust diurnal pattern, with a pronounced peak in physiological activity during the afternoon (e.g., 3-4 PM deviation from mesor of +30.09, Z-score 3.82, aligning with the 3:42 PM acrophase) and substantial dips during nocturnal hours. A healthy, below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.61) further supports this robust physiological profile. Such well-entrained and dynamic circadian parameters are generally associated with better mental and physical health outcomes.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant adheres to healthy lifestyle choices, reporting very low substance use across all categories. Exercise patterns are consistent, particularly with frequent ""exercising with others"" (Z-score 1.23). While engagement in several recreational activities, including socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41 for 16-30 minutes), watching TV, playing video games, and internet usage, is lower than the population average, these isolated findings are not strongly correlated with CES-D and do not contradict the overwhelming evidence of positive psychological and physiological health. The relatively lower social engagement, in particular, does not appear to detract from the participant's high self-reported happiness and strong psychological resources in this context.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on the comprehensive multimodal analysis, there is substantial evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score, placing the participant in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological state is overwhelmingly positive: very low anxiety, very high self-esteem, high happiness, and high trust. These factors have strong negative correlations with CES-D, meaning individuals exhibiting these traits are highly likely to have lower depressive symptoms. Subjective and objective sleep metrics indicate good quality and ample sleep duration, another protective factor against depression. Physiologically, the robust and highly regulated circadian rhythm, characterized by high stability, amplitude, and a healthy resting heart rate, signifies strong physiological health typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, healthy lifestyle behaviors such as minimal substance use and regular exercise are generally linked to better mental well-being. The confluence of these highly positive indicators strongly suggests a low burden of depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
There is very limited direct evidence to suggest a high CES-D score. While the participant reports lower engagement in certain recreational activities and socializing compared to the population average, the correlations of these specific behaviors with CES-D are negligible or weak, and these observations are heavily outweighed by the robust positive indicators across psychological, sleep, and physiological domains. Average perceived stress is not a strong differentiating factor. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the participant would fall into the top half of the CES-D distribution.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile is consistently characterized by strong psychological well-being, excellent sleep, robust physiological regulation, and healthy lifestyle habits. The highly favorable scores on anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, trust, and health satisfaction, coupled with a well-entrained and dynamic circadian system, strongly point towards a mental health status inconsistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The occasional lower engagement in certain recreational activities is a minor point that does not negate the overwhelming evidence for overall positive functioning. Consequently, the participant is very likely to have a CES-D score in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

95559,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by a notable divergence between stable psychological traits indicative of resilience and current state measures and physiological markers suggesting areas of distress and potential dysregulation. Psychologically, the individual exhibits significantly lower trait anxiety (Z-score -1.22) and higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.96) than the study population, both of which are strongly correlated with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are also slightly below average (Z-score -0.44), further supporting a potentially protective psychological disposition. However, current self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.53) are below average, and these lower scores are associated with higher depressive symptomatology.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an above-average engagement in various forms of exercise, which typically serves as a protective factor against depressive symptoms due to its negative correlation with CES-D. Conversely, substance use, particularly beer consumption, is elevated (Z-score 1.72), although its correlation with CES-D is negligible in this dataset. Recreational habits show above-average engagement in passive activities such as watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music, with both exhibiting weak positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting a potential, albeit slight, association with higher depressive symptoms.

A particularly salient aspect of this participant's profile lies in their sleep and circadian rhythm patterns. Subjectively, sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score 7.0), a clinically significant finding. Objectively, wearable data reveals a significantly late median sleep start time (02:10:59) and shorter-than-average sleep duration (6 hours 39 minutes, Z-score -0.66). Most strikingly, the participant engages in napping with a frequency that is over two standard deviations above the population mean (Z-score 2.07), a behavior strongly positively correlated with CES-D. Further supporting circadian disruption, the interdaily stability (Z-score -1.98) and intradaily variability (Z-score -1.8) of heart rate are exceptionally low, indicating highly irregular daily physiological rhythms and a blunted, less dynamic heart rate pattern within days. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is also notably below average (Z-score -1.16), suggesting a reduced physiological response throughout the day, which has a negative correlation with CES-D, thus implying a link to higher depressive symptoms. Hourly heart rate deviations indicate a relatively higher heart rate in the early morning (12-1 AM) compared to the mesor, possibly reflecting delayed sleep onset or poor sleep consolidation, and a comparatively lower heart rate in the late morning and early afternoon, potentially suggesting reduced daytime activity or blunted physiological arousal during these periods. These objective and subjective sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances represent a substantial area of concern, often implicated in the experience of depressive symptoms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong psychological traits that are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Specifically, their trait anxiety (STAI score Z-score -1.22) is significantly below the population mean, and this measure has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, indicating that lower anxiety is associated with lower CES-D. Similarly, self-esteem (RSES score Z-score 0.96) is significantly above average and carries a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, suggesting that higher self-esteem is linked to lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.44) is slightly below average, with a positive correlation (0.28) implying lower stress is associated with lower CES-D. The participant also reports above-average engagement in exercise (Z-scores ranging from 0.25 to 0.53), which is consistently negatively correlated with CES-D, further supporting a tendency towards lower symptoms. Physiologically, the mesor and resting heart rate are slightly below average, with positive correlations (0.19) suggesting a minor association with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the aforementioned psychological strengths, there is substantial evidence pointing towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.53), both of which have moderate negative correlations with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively), implying that lower scores on these measures are associated with higher CES-D. Crucially, sleep and circadian rhythm metrics are highly suggestive of distress. The PSQI score of 7 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. Objectively, the frequency of daily napping is exceptionally high (Z-score 2.07), and this behavior exhibits a positive correlation (0.22) with CES-D. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is notably blunted (Z-score -1.16), and its negative correlation (-0.1) with CES-D suggests that a lower amplitude is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The very low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.98) also points to significant circadian disruption. While direct correlations for interdaily stability are negligible, such a profound irregularity is widely recognized as a correlate of mood disturbances.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a compelling dichotomy between robust trait-level psychological protective factors (low anxiety, high self-esteem) and significant current-state indicators of distress. While the stable traits are strong predictors for lower CES-D, the multimodal evidence for current mood, sleep, and physiological dysregulation is pervasive and robust. The clinically significant disturbed sleep, the extreme frequency of napping (a powerful behavioral indicator often reflecting inadequate nocturnal sleep and linked to higher CES-D), and the profound disruptions in circadian rhythmicity (low interdaily stability and blunted heart rate amplitude, with the latter directly correlated with higher CES-D) collectively suggest a current symptom burden that likely outweighs the protective influence of the psychological traits. The convergence of self-reported lower happiness and health satisfaction with objective sleep and physiological disruptions paints a picture of current struggles. Therefore, despite inherent resilience, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is likely elevated relative to the study population.

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by both psychological vulnerabilities and indicators of physiological health. Psychologically, while trait anxiety is average (Z-score -0.03), it shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), suggesting that for this individual, anxiety proneness may co-occur with depressive symptoms. Notably, self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.31) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), indicating a significant association with higher depressive symptom burden. Similarly, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Perceived stress levels are elevated (Z-score 0.65), though only weakly correlated with CES-D (0.28). Interpersonal trust is somewhat lower than the population mean (Z-score -0.46) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41). In contrast, health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score 1.3) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting a robust perception of physical well-being.

Sleep patterns are subjectively and objectively disturbed. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance via the PSQI (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), indicating poorer sleep quality than average. Objective Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 48 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.48). Both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit higher than average variability (Z-scores 0.39 and 0.41 respectively), with a late median sleep start time of 02:28:00. This increased variability in sleep parameters shows weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.20 and 0.22 respectively), suggesting a potential link between irregular sleep and depressive symptomatology.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a lower than average overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.54) and resting heart rate (Z-score -1.04), which generally indicate good cardiovascular fitness. However, an examination of circadian rhythms reveals signs of irregularity. Interdaily stability is below average (Z-score -0.49), and 24-hour autocorrelation is significantly low (Z-score -1.45), both suggesting a lack of day-to-day consistency in heart rate patterns. While intradaily variability and amplitude are average, the acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:17 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor confirm this pattern, with particularly high physiological arousal observed in the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 4-5 PM with a Z-score of 2.34 and 5-6 PM with a Z-score of 1.95), while activity remains at lower levels well into the morning, with below-average deviations persisting until around 9-10 AM.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in above-average individual exercise (Z-score 1.07) but reports no participation in exercise with others (Z-score -1.58), with the latter showing a weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23). Alcohol consumption (wine or liquor) is above average (Z-score 0.94), though its correlation with CES-D is negligible. Daily recreational habits indicate above-average engagement in passive screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (Z-score 0.85), both showing weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.13 and 0.25 respectively). Conversely, music listening is below average (Z-score -0.72) and reading is not reported. Socializing with friends is reported at an average level (Z-score 0.16). These patterns suggest a preference for solitary physical activity, coupled with potentially more sedentary, screen-based leisure, which might be associated with aspects of mood.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards the participant likely experiencing a higher burden of depressive symptoms, placing them in the top 50% of the study population (i.e., a CES-D score greater than 11.5, the population median). Key indicators include below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.31) and self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), both of which are strongly or moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively). Lower trust (Z-score -0.46) is also moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41). Perceived stress is above average (Z-score 0.65). Furthermore, despite an average trait anxiety score (Z-score -0.03), its very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) suggests a tight link between anxiety and depressive symptoms for this individual. Objectively and subjectively, sleep quality is impaired: the PSQI indicates disturbed sleep, and Fitbit data shows shorter (Z-score -0.48) and more variable sleep duration (Z-score 0.39, correlation 0.20) and start times (Z-score 0.41, correlation 0.22), patterns commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm analysis also reveals reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.49) and significantly low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.45), indicating highly irregular daily physiological rhythms which can accompany mood disorders. Lastly, above-average engagement in passive screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28, correlation 0.13) and internet usage (Z-score 0.85, correlation 0.25) shows weak positive correlations with CES-D, aligning with higher symptom burden.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, fewer factors suggest a lower or average CES-D score (i.e., a CES-D score less than or equal to 11.5). The participant reports significantly high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3), a factor moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), which could serve as a protective buffer. Physiologically, both the Mesor (Z-score -1.54) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -1.04) are substantially below the population average, indicating good cardiovascular fitness. While these have weak positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting lower values might relate to lower CES-D scores for this population, their primary interpretation points to general physical health. The participant also exercises alone frequently (Z-score 1.07), an activity generally beneficial for mental health, though its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is negligible. Additionally, less music listening (Z-score -0.72) has a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.25), implying that this specific behavior might be associated with *lower* CES-D. However, this particular correlation is weak and potentially counter-intuitive.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Upon holistic evaluation, the evidence for elevated depressive symptoms significantly outweighs the evidence for lower or median symptoms. The strong negative correlations of self-esteem and happiness with CES-D, combined with the participant's lower scores in these areas, are particularly impactful. The pervasive pattern of disturbed sleep (both subjective and objective, with higher variability), coupled with objectively irregular circadian rhythms, strongly aligns with characteristics of individuals experiencing higher depressive symptomatology. While the participant exhibits good physical health indicators and high health satisfaction, these protective factors appear insufficient to offset the cumulative impact of negative psychological traits, sleep disruption, and circadian dysregulation that are consistently associated with higher CES-D scores. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, the participant is more likely to have a CES-D score in the top half of the study population distribution.

59592,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several patterns associated with heightened psychological distress. The individual reported an elevated score on the STAI–Trait scale (46.0, Z-score 0.46), classifying them as anxious, a finding that correlates strongly and positively (0.81) with CES-D scores in the study population. Concurrently, self-esteem was reported as below average (RSES score 35.0, Z-Score -0.45), which demonstrates a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D. Subjective happiness was also below the population average (score 3.0, Z-Score -0.53), negatively correlating with CES-D scores (-0.46). Perceived stress was slightly above average (PSS score 23.0, Z-Score 0.38), aligning with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health was reported as below average (score 3.67, Z-score -0.45), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.39) to CES-D. Counteracting these patterns, the participant reported above-average interpersonal trust (score 3.5, Z-Score 0.5), which holds a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41), suggesting a potentially protective social factor. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, was classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 5.0 (Z-Score -0.8), indicating better than average subjective sleep quality relative to the study population, despite 5 often being a clinical cutoff.

Behavioral patterns suggest a predominantly sedentary lifestyle with limited social exercise. The participant reported exercising alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32), but less than 1-2 times a month for exercise with others (Z-score -0.88) and no participation in sports (Z-score -1.09). These reduced levels of social and competitive physical activity show weak negative correlations with CES-D. Recreational habits include above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85), both showing weak positive correlations with CES-D. Similarly, more time was spent listening to music (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.67) and engaging in sedentary hobbies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.82), also with weak positive correlations. Socializing with friends was reported as 1-2 hours daily, close to the population average. Substance usage included weekly wine or liquor consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94), which is above average, but recreational and non-prescribed drug use were reported as ""Not at all,"" which aligns with weak positive correlations indicating lower CES-D for reduced usage. Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours 57 minutes (Z-Score -0.29), slightly below average but with a notably consistent sleep start time (standard deviation of 39 minutes, Z-Score -0.97). The consistency in sleep start time shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D, implying that lower variability (as observed) is associated with potentially lower depressive symptoms. However, the participant also reported a slightly above-average frequency of daily naps (Z-Score 0.61), which weakly correlates with higher CES-D.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveal notable patterns in cardiovascular activity and circadian rhythmicity. The participant's resting heart rate (66.1 bpm, Z-Score 0.95) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 77.31, Z-Score 0.46) are both above the population average, correlating weakly and positively with CES-D. A significant finding is the markedly reduced amplitude of the heart rate-based circadian rhythm (6.93, Z-Score -1.25), indicating a flatter daily heart rate profile which weakly correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.1). This suggests a less pronounced physiological fluctuation throughout the day, potentially indicative of reduced adaptability or a dysregulated autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, intradaily variability was significantly elevated (0.78, Z-Score 1.65), pointing towards more fragmented or irregular physiological activity within a single day. Interdaily stability was below average (0.3, Z-Score -0.9), implying less day-to-day regularity in the circadian rhythm, although these non-parametric measures had negligible correlations with CES-D. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurred relatively late in the day at 4:54 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor followed a typical diurnal pattern, with lower rates during early morning sleep hours and elevated rates during waking and evening hours, peaking notably around 6-7 PM, though individual hourly deviations had very weak correlations with CES-D.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
There is substantial evidence suggesting the participant's CES-D score is likely in the top 50% of the study population. Key self-reported psychological measures strongly align with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46), which has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D. Similarly, self-esteem is notably below average (RSES Z-score -0.45) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Subjective happiness is also below average (Z-score -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated (-0.46) with CES-D. Additionally, perceived stress is slightly elevated (PSS Z-score 0.38, weak positive correlation 0.28), and health satisfaction is below average (Z-score -0.45, moderate negative correlation -0.39). Physiologically, the participant's resting heart rate (Z-score 0.95) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.46) are above average, both showing weak positive correlations with CES-D. Most significantly, the heart rate circadian amplitude is markedly reduced (Z-score -1.25), indicative of a flatter physiological rhythm often associated with compromised well-being, though its correlation with CES-D is weak. Intradaily variability is also significantly elevated (Z-score 1.65), potentially pointing to fragmented physiological activity patterns. Behavioral patterns of reduced social exercise, lack of sports participation, and increased screen time/sedentary hobbies also show weak positive correlations, further leaning towards higher CES-D.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, there are some indicators that could suggest a lower or more median CES-D score. The participant's subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is notably better than the population average (Z-score -0.8), which typically would be protective against depressive symptoms. The participant also reported above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5), which has a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) with CES-D, suggesting this social factor could be mitigating. Fitbit data indicates a highly consistent sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score -0.97), a positive sleep hygiene habit that is generally beneficial for mental health, and whose correlation (0.22) suggests lower variability is associated with lower CES-D. Furthermore, the participant reported no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, which, given their weak positive correlations with CES-D, would suggest lower depressive symptom burden.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the multimodal evidence holistically, the collective weight of factors indicative of higher depressive symptomatology appears to outweigh those suggesting lower or average symptoms. The robust and highly correlated self-reported psychological distress markers (anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness) are particularly compelling. While the participant exhibits good subjective sleep quality and strong interpersonal trust, these positive aspects appear insufficient to fully offset the pervasive patterns of elevated anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction. The physiological markers of a dysregulated autonomic system, such as elevated resting heart rate and a significantly flattened heart rate circadian amplitude, further support a state of increased physiological burden that frequently co-occurs with depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite some protective factors, the overall profile points towards a greater burden of depressive symptoms within the study population.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
89652,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"## Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several strengths associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Notably, the participant exhibits low trait anxiety (STAI score 35.0, Z-score -0.62), robust self-esteem (RSES score 44.0, Z-Score 0.82), and elevated current happiness (score 5.0, Z-Score 1.64). These traits are significantly correlated with lower CES-D scores (STAI: 0.81, Self-Esteem: -0.71, Happy: -0.46), suggesting a resilient psychological disposition. Furthermore, the participant reports a high degree of interpersonal trust (score 4.67, Z-Score 2.75) which also negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.41), further supporting a profile generally less prone to depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as good (score 4.0, Z-Score -1.26), falling well below the clinical threshold, indicating perceived restorative sleep.

In contrast to these positive indicators, the participant reports a higher level of perceived stress (PSS score 28.0, Z-Score 1.74) compared to the study population, which shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.29). Despite this, overall health satisfaction is average (Z-score -0.12), and the participant maintains a healthy Body Mass Index. Lifestyle behaviors concerning substance use are consistently low, with no reported use of alcohol or recreational drugs, a pattern generally associated with positive health outcomes. Exercise habits are mixed, with regular engagement in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-Score 0.91) but less frequent individual or group exercise. Recreational screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos and playing video games are notably low, while internet usage and socializing with friends are reported at average levels.

Objective sleep and circadian rhythm metrics reveal areas of potential inconsistency despite the participant's subjective experience of good sleep. The median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes is shorter than the population average (Z-Score -0.76). More significantly, there is high variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 172 minutes, Z-Score 1.62) and moderate variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 106 minutes, Z-Score 0.51), both of which show positive correlations with CES-D (0.21 and 0.22, respectively). Additionally, the participant reports more frequent daily napping (Z-Score 1.49), which also positively correlates with CES-D (0.22) and may suggest an attempt to compensate for insufficient or irregular nighttime sleep. While interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is average, intradaily variability is elevated (Z-Score 1.3), and 24-hour autocorrelation is lower than average (Z-Score -0.87), collectively suggesting a less regular and more fragmented daily physiological rhythm. The overall circadian pattern of heart rate, however, appears typically diurnal; mean hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicate significant lowering during sleep (e.g., -21.45 at 5-6 AM relative to a mesor of 72.97 bpm) and elevated activity during the day, peaking in the afternoon (e.g., +17.84 at 3-4 PM), consistent with normal physiological arousal patterns throughout the day.

## Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

A substantial body of evidence from self-report measures strongly indicates a CES-D score in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population (which has a 50th percentile at 11.5). The participant exhibits low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62) with a very strong positive correlation to CES-D (0.81), meaning lower anxiety is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is notably high (RSES Z-score 0.82) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). Similarly, current self-reported happiness is significantly higher than average (Z-score 1.64) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Interpersonal trust is exceptionally high (Z-score 2.75) and also negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41). Furthermore, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 4.0, Z-score -1.26), which generally correlates with lower depressive symptoms. These combined psychological strengths present a robust profile consistent with a lower burden of depressive symptomatology.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Conversely, some metrics suggest potential vulnerabilities that could elevate depressive symptoms, although these are generally less potent in their correlation with CES-D compared to the previous points. The participant reports significantly higher perceived stress (PSS Z-score 1.74) which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.29). Objectively, sleep patterns show considerable irregularity, with a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score 1.62) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.51), both moderately positively correlated with CES-D (0.21 and 0.22, respectively). The participant also reports more frequent napping (Z-score 1.49), which similarly correlates positively with CES-D (0.22) and could indicate compensatory behavior for fragmented or insufficient sleep. From wearable data, an elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 1.3) suggests less stable daily physiological rhythms, although its correlation with CES-D is very weak (-0.05).

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

While the participant exhibits elevated perceived stress and notable objective sleep irregularities, the weight of evidence from core psychological traits strongly points towards a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms. The very strong inverse relationships between high self-esteem, high happiness, and low trait anxiety with CES-D, combined with good subjective sleep quality, are powerful indicators. The observed sleep variability and increased napping, while correlated with CES-D, appear to be secondary to these primary psychological strengths. Given the overall pattern, the participant is more likely to fall into the lower range of depressive symptomatology compared to their peers.

28724,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

**Psychological Profile and Affective State:**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile generally indicates a relatively favorable affective state compared to the study population. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is slightly below the population average (Score 40.0, Z-score -0.13) and shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), suggesting lower anxiety may correspond to lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Score 39.0, Z-Score 0.11) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), indicating higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. A notable finding is the participant's significantly elevated self-reported happiness (Current 5.0, Z-Score 1.64), which is also moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), strongly suggesting a lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress levels are below the population average (Score 20.0, Z-Score -0.44), showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.28), further suggesting a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Score 3.33, Z-Score 0.18) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41). However, satisfaction with physical health is slightly below average (Score 4.0, Z-score -0.2) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), which could indicate a potential area of concern linked to depressive symptomatology.

**Sleep Patterns:**
Sleep data presents a mixed picture, combining self-reported disturbance with objective consistency. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with a score of 6.0, exceeding the common clinical threshold of 5, despite the Z-score being slightly below average (-0.33) relative to the study population. This indicates that while subjectively problematic, the level of disturbance may not be extreme within this specific cohort. In contrast, wearable data demonstrates robust sleep habits. The median sleep duration of 7 hours 49 minutes is significantly above the population average (Z-Score 0.79). Furthermore, both sleep duration (65 minutes, Z-Score -0.81) and sleep start time (28 minutes, Z-Score -1.22) show significantly lower variability than the population average, indicating highly consistent and regular sleep patterns. Low variability in sleep duration and start time are weakly correlated with higher CES-D (0.19 and 0.21 respectively). Napping frequency is negligible and near the population average (0.07, Z-Score -0.02).

**Circadian Rhythm and Physiological Arousal:**
Wearable data on circadian rhythms suggests some disruption in the physiological regularity of the participant. Interdaily stability (0.32, Z-Score -0.74) is below average, and intradaily variability (0.76, Z-Score 1.51) is significantly above average, indicating less stable and more irregular physiological activity patterns throughout the day. This is further supported by a lower-than-average 24-hour autocorrelation (0.19, Z-Score -1.12), all of which are weakly correlated with CES-D. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly below average (70.67 bpm, Z-Score -0.45) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), implying that this slightly lower average heart rate would be associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, the resting heart rate is slightly above average (59.8 bpm, Z-Score 0.2) and also weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), suggesting a slight elevation could be associated with higher depressive symptoms. The aggregate hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal distinct daily patterns of physiological arousal. Significant positive deviations from the mesor, with high Z-scores, occur during certain daytime hours, particularly 8-9 AM (Z-Score 0.94), 9-10 AM (Z-Score 1.07), 11 AM-12 PM (Z-Score 1.71), and notably 1-2 PM (Z-Score 2.10). These indicate periods of relatively higher cardiovascular activity and physiological arousal compared to the general study population during these specific times. Conversely, heart rate dips significantly below the mesor during nocturnal hours, consistent with sleep, although some Z-scores in the early morning (e.g., 3-6 AM) are positive, suggesting a relatively less pronounced drop in heart rate compared to peers during deep sleep phases. Late evening (9-12 AM) shows significant negative Z-scores for deviations, indicating a relatively sharper decline in HR towards sleep compared to the population.

**Behavioral Habits:**
The participant demonstrates a varied engagement in lifestyle behaviors. Substance usage is generally low, with no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and no beer consumption (Z-Score -1.12). However, wine or liquor consumption is above average (1-2 times a week, Z-Score 0.94). Exercise habits are robust, particularly exercising alone (three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.07), suggesting a preference for solitary physical activity. Engagement in sports is non-existent (Z-Score -1.09), and exercising with others is at an average frequency. Daily recreational habits indicate moderate engagement across various activities such as watching TV/videos (31 minutes an hour, Z-Score 0.64), internet usage (1-2 hours, Z-Score 0.18), and socializing with friends (1-2 hours, Z-Score 0.16). Overall, these patterns suggest an individual who is physically active, maintains social engagement, and utilizes common forms of recreation without extreme levels of sedentary behavior; most habits do not show strong correlations with CES-D.

---

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Multiple self-reported psychological measures strongly indicate a lower depressive symptom burden. The participant reports trait anxiety (STAI) slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.13), which, given its strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), suggests lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-Score 0.11) and highly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), supporting a lower CES-D score. A particularly salient finding is the significantly elevated self-reported happiness (Z-Score 1.64), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), providing strong evidence for a lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is also below average (Z-Score -0.44), and trust is slightly above average (Z-Score 0.18), both aligning with indicators of lower CES-D. Objectively, Fitbit data shows significantly above-average median sleep duration (Z-Score 0.79) and remarkably consistent sleep patterns with significantly lower variability in both sleep duration (Z-Score -0.81) and sleep start time (Z-Score -1.22), which are generally protective factors for mental well-being and weakly correlated with lower CES-D. The mesor heart rate is slightly below average (Z-Score -0.45) and positively correlated with CES-D, indicating this lower value would align with a lower CES-D score.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite overall positive psychological indicators, some data points suggest potential areas of concern that could contribute to higher depressive symptomatology. The participant self-reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (Score 6.0), which surpasses the common clinical threshold, even though their Z-score is slightly below average for the population. This subjective experience of poor sleep quality can be a significant factor in depression. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.2) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting this lower satisfaction could be associated with higher depressive symptoms. From wearable data, there are indications of physiological dysregulation in circadian rhythms, specifically below-average interdaily stability (Z-Score -0.74), significantly above-average intradaily variability (Z-Score 1.51), and below-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-Score -1.12). While these metrics have weak correlations with CES-D, they generally reflect less consistent and more fragmented physiological patterns, which can be observed in individuals experiencing distress. Additionally, the participant's resting heart rate is slightly above the population average (Z-Score 0.2) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), suggesting a slight elevation could be associated with higher depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the predominant evidence points towards the participant experiencing a relatively lower burden of depressive symptoms. The strong self-reported indicators of well-being—significantly higher happiness, above-average self-esteem and trust, and below-average trait anxiety and perceived stress—are highly correlated with lower CES-D scores. While the self-reported ""disturbed sleep"" (PSQI) and physiological markers of circadian rhythm disruption (IS, IV, autocorrelation) are concerning and generally associated with mental health issues, the objective Fitbit data demonstrates excellent sleep quantity and consistency. The discrepancies suggest that while the subjective experience of sleep might be poor, the underlying sleep schedule and duration are robust. The correlations between CES-D and the self-reported psychological measures are notably stronger than those for the physiological or sleep rhythm metrics. Therefore, the robust psychological protective factors and consistent objective sleep patterns likely outweigh the subjective sleep quality issues and physiological dysregulations in predicting the overall CES-D score.

Based on this holistic analysis, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden would likely place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
69831,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data present a complex profile, revealing a notable contrast between some indicators of well-being and several areas of concern. On the one hand, the participant reports lower-than-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.33) and notably low perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -1.53), suggesting a relative absence of chronic worry or daily stressors compared to their peers. Furthermore, their social engagement is remarkably high, reporting over four hours of socializing with friends daily (Z-score = 2.53), which is often associated with psychological resilience. Sleep statistics derived from wearables indicate an objectively robust sleep pattern, with a median duration of 8 hours (Z-score = 1.01), placing them well above the population average, and significantly less variability in sleep start times (SD Z-score = -1.05), implying a highly consistent bedtime routine. Physical activity includes regular sports participation (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.91), and their resting heart rate (56.0 bpm, Z-score = -0.26) is below the population average, suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Their circadian rhythm, characterized by a slightly above-average amplitude (Z-score = 0.2) and average interdaily stability, indicates a well-defined daily physiological rhythm.

Despite these positive indicators, several aspects of the participant's data suggest potential psychological and behavioral challenges that could be associated with depressive symptomatology. Most notably, the participant exhibits below-average self-esteem (Z-score = -0.31) and self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53), with these traits correlating strongly negatively with CES-D scores (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively). Similarly, their satisfaction with physical health is significantly lower than average (Z-score = -1.2), also correlating moderately negatively with CES-D (-0.39). While the participant's PSQI score of 6.0 technically classifies their sleep as ""disturbed,"" their Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their subjective sleep disturbance is actually lower than the average study participant's. This suggests that while they meet a clinical cutoff for sleep disturbance, they perceive their sleep as less problematic than many of their peers. Objectively, their BMI of 15.6 is classified as underweight, which may indicate nutritional or health concerns.

Behaviorally, a significant area of concern is the participant's academic performance, marked by a substantial decline in GPA from 2.67 in Fall 2015 to 1.90 in Fall 2016. This downward trend can be a potent behavioral indicator of academic disengagement, stress, or underlying mental health challenges. Although the participant engages in sports, they report no participation in general exercise, either alone or with others (Z-scores = -1.93 and -1.58, respectively). Furthermore, their daily recreational habits are characterized by high engagement in passive media consumption, including significantly above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 1.91), using the internet (Z-score = 1.52), and listening to music (Z-score = 2.06). While socializing with friends is also high, the passive recreation activities show weak positive correlations with CES-D scores (0.13, 0.26, 0.26 respectively), suggesting that a high reliance on these activities might be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Physiologically, their mean hourly heart rate deviations reveal relatively deep drops during sleep hours (e.g., -22.31 from mesor at 4-5 AM), and a late acrophase (peak physiological arousal) at 4:43 PM, with pronounced peaks in heart rate activity during the evening (e.g., 18.13 above mesor at 7-8 PM, Z-score = 1.15). While good sleep duration and regularity are observed, the combination of subjective sleep disturbance, declining academic performance, low self-esteem, and reduced happiness points to potential underlying difficulties.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several factors that typically correlate with lower depressive symptomatology. Their self-reported trait anxiety (STAI, Z-score = -0.33) is below the population average, and given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D (0.81), this strongly suggests a lower CES-D score. Similarly, their perceived stress (PSS, Z-score = -1.53) is remarkably low, and while its positive correlation with CES-D (0.28) is weaker, it still points towards fewer depressive symptoms. Objectively, the participant's sleep duration (8 hours, Z-score = 1.01) is significantly above average, and their sleep start time regularity (SD Z-score = -1.05) is exceptionally consistent, both of which are generally associated with better mental health outcomes. High levels of social engagement (Socializing with Friends, Z-score = 2.53) and slightly above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.18, with a moderate negative correlation of -0.41 to CES-D) further contribute to this evidence. The participant's engagement in sports and a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.26) also suggest a degree of physical well-being.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, a substantial body of evidence suggests the participant may experience an elevated depressive symptom burden. Most prominently, the participant's self-esteem (Z-score = -0.31), happiness (Z-score = -0.53), and health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.2) are all below the population average, and critically, these metrics have moderate to strong negative correlations with CES-D scores (-0.71, -0.46, and -0.39, respectively). These strong relationships indicate that lower scores on these measures are robust predictors of higher depressive symptoms. A significant behavioral indicator is the consistent decline in GPA from 2.67 to 1.90, which often reflects academic struggle, decreased motivation, or emotional distress. While their subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI score = 6.0) is less than the average participant's, it still crosses a common clinical threshold, implying a degree of subjective sleep difficulty. The participant's underweight BMI (15.6) and high engagement in passive recreational activities (Internet Usage Z-score = 1.52, Listening to Music Z-score = 2.06), which show weak positive correlations with CES-D, could also be considered supporting factors, potentially indicative of disengagement from more active pursuits.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a complex profile with both protective factors (low anxiety and stress, regular and sufficient sleep, high social engagement) and significant risk factors (low self-esteem, low happiness, low health satisfaction, declining GPA). While the low anxiety and stress scores might initially suggest a lower CES-D, the very strong correlations of self-esteem (-0.71), happiness (-0.46), and health satisfaction (-0.39) with CES-D scores carry substantial weight in predicting depressive symptom burden. The objective and concerning decline in academic performance, coupled with the participant's self-reported lower self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, paint a compelling picture of an individual struggling with core aspects often disrupted in depression. Although many of the wearable metrics do not strongly correlate with CES-D or show only weak correlations, the behavioral and psychological self-report data, particularly the highly impactful variables of self-esteem and happiness, strongly suggest an elevated level of depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite some seemingly positive indicators, the overall evidence points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms within the study population.

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by areas of both strength and potential vulnerability concerning depressive symptoms. Psychologically, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem and happiness, which are significantly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting a heightened risk for depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is also below the population mean. Perceived stress levels are within the average range, and while the STAI score is slightly below average, it is still classified as ""anxious"" and shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D, indicating a link between anxiety and depressive symptoms within this population. Conversely, the participant demonstrates higher-than-average interpersonal trust, a factor that negatively correlates with CES-D, potentially serving as a protective psychological resource. Academically, a declining trend in GPA over recent semesters may indicate increasing academic challenges.

Regarding sleep patterns, self-reported sleep quality (PSQI) is good, with a score that is notably better than the population average. However, wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 34 minutes, which is shorter than average, though nightly sleep duration is consistent (low standard deviation). The participant typically goes to bed late, around 1:00 AM, with slightly higher variability in sleep start times. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show a generally regular pattern; while interdaily stability and intradaily variability are slightly below average, the 24-hour autocorrelation is above average, indicating a consistent daily rhythm. The heart rate acrophase occurs in the mid-afternoon (3:34 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a robust diurnal pattern, with a sharp increase in cardiovascular activity observed between 7-8 AM, reflecting a strong physiological awakening response, and heart rate remaining elevated throughout the day until late evening.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant reports very low to no substance usage across various categories. Physical activity is primarily characterized by frequent engagement in organized sports, contrasting with minimal participation in unguided individual or group exercise. Daily recreational activities show a preference for listening to music and socializing, along with average internet usage, while engagement in passive sedentary activities like watching TV, playing video games, or reading is notably low. Physiologically, the participant displays a healthy resting heart rate of 54.6 bpm, which is below the population average and indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The overall mean heart rate (mesor) is also slightly below average, and the circadian amplitude is slightly reduced, suggesting a somewhat less pronounced daily fluctuation in heart rate than observed in the broader study population, despite the clear diurnal pattern.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
The participant's self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is good and falls below the population average (Z-score -0.8), suggesting a lower burden of sleep-related depressive symptoms. High levels of interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.15), which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, could serve as a protective factor. Physiological indicators include a below-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.42), indicating good cardiovascular fitness; a lower resting heart rate is associated with lower CES-D scores in this population. Behavioral patterns show very low to no substance use and consistent, frequent participation in organized sports, activities generally considered beneficial for mental well-being. Furthermore, while classified as anxious, the participant's STAI score is slightly below the population mean, suggesting that general anxiety levels are not overtly elevated compared to peers.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
Key self-reported psychological traits indicate elevated risk. The participant exhibits notably low self-esteem (Z-score -0.87) and low self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53), both of which are strongly and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores, respectively. Similarly, satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z-score -0.45) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D. Although the STAI score is not high, its strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) suggests that even average anxiety can be a significant indicator of depressive symptoms in this context. Wearable data reveals a shorter-than-average median sleep duration (6 hours 34 minutes; Z-score -0.77), a common symptom associated with depression, even if subjective quality is rated highly. Additionally, the participant shows slightly higher variability in sleep start times, which is positively correlated with CES-D. A declining GPA across recent semesters may also reflect academic disengagement or difficulty often associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant demonstrates protective factors such as good cardiovascular health, high trust, low substance use, and engagement in organized sports, the self-reported psychological measures are particularly salient. The significantly low self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, all strongly or moderately correlated with higher CES-D scores, represent core indicators of psychological distress. These internal experiences often weigh heavily in the overall burden of depressive symptoms. The objective finding of shorter sleep duration and a declining academic performance further reinforces concerns. Despite favorable physiological indicators and some healthy behaviors, the pervasive negative self-perceptions and reduced well-being suggest that the participant likely experiences a higher level of depressive symptomatology compared to the average student in the study population.

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile indicates a significant burden of negative affect and low self-worth. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably elevated at a score of 64.0, placing the participant 2.24 standard deviations above the population mean and demonstrating a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (r=0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is remarkably low, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 19.0, which is 2.7 standard deviations below the mean and exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.70). Further reflecting this pattern, self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61, r=-0.46) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.95, r=-0.39) are substantially below average. Interpersonal trust is also reported at a lower level (Z-score -1.42, r=-0.41). While perceived stress falls within the average range (Z-score 0.1), its weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.28) suggests a general disposition towards higher distress. These self-reported measures collectively depict a psychological state characterized by high chronic anxiety, diminished self-regard, and reduced overall well-being, consistently aligning with increased depressive symptomatology.

In terms of behavioral patterns, the participant demonstrates engagement in regular physical activity, exercising alone three or more times a week (Z-score 1.07) and with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53). Socializing with friends is also a prominent activity, reported for 3-4 hours daily (Z-score 1.74). These active and social behaviors are generally considered protective factors, though their correlations with CES-D in this dataset are negligible or weak. Conversely, the participant reports high engagement in more passive recreational activities, dedicating more than 4 hours daily to Internet usage (Z-score 2.19) and listening to music (Z-score 2.06), both of which show a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.24). Substance use across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is minimal, with Z-scores well below population averages, indicating these are not prominent factors. Academically, a slight decline in GPA was observed from Fall 2015 to Spring 2016, with no GPA recorded for Fall 2016, which could suggest periods of academic difficulty or disengagement.

Sleep quality, as self-reported by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), indicates disturbed sleep with a score of 6.0, commonly suggesting clinically significant sleep disturbance. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 43 minutes, slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.58). Despite this, both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit less variability than the population mean (Z-scores -1.06 and -0.56, respectively), suggesting a relatively consistent sleep schedule. Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms shows a robust 24-hour rhythmicity (autocorrelation at 24 hours Z-score 1.48) and average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.5). However, intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.81), indicating a somewhat less stable physiological pattern within days. The participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor) and resting heart rate are slightly elevated (Z-scores 0.95 and 0.65, respectively), both showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.19). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is somewhat lower than average (Z-score -0.75), potentially suggesting a dampened physiological range.

A distinct pattern of physiological arousal emerges from the aggregated hourly heart rate data. The participant exhibits an exceptionally pronounced surge in cardiovascular activity during the early morning hours, with heart rate deviations from the mesor reaching 15.2 beats per minute (Z-score 4.44) between 6-7 AM and a dramatic 29.82 bpm (Z-score 4.61) between 7-8 AM. These Z-scores represent unusually high levels of physiological arousal relative to the study population during these times. Following this intense morning activation, heart rate activity generally remains above the mesor through the late morning. However, during the afternoon (specifically between 1 PM and 4 PM), heart rate deviations from the mesor are often negative or near zero (e.g., -1.94 bpm at 2-3 PM, 0.13 bpm at 3-4 PM), with corresponding negative Z-scores, indicating periods of relatively lower physiological arousal compared to the participant’s daily average and the population mean for those times. Evening hours show renewed positive deviations from the mesor, albeit less intensely than the morning surge, before gradually declining toward baseline during the night. This pattern points to a highly reactive physiological system upon waking, potentially indicative of elevated morning stress or anxiety, followed by periods of relative physiological dampening in the afternoon.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on the multimodal data, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score (i.e., above the 50th percentile of 11.0).

Evidence for an elevated CES-D score is compelling and pervasive across several self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits extremely high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 2.24, correlation with CES-D: 0.81), indicating a significant proneness to chronic anxiety, a common comorbidity and contributor to depressive symptoms. This is compounded by remarkably low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -2.7, correlation with CES-D: -0.70), a core feature often associated with depression. Further supporting this, self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61, correlation with CES-D: -0.46) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.95, correlation with CES-D: -0.39) are notably low. The reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 6.0) also aligns with common depressive symptoms. Physiologically, the highly reactive morning heart rate surge (Z-scores 4.44, 4.61), coupled with a slightly elevated resting heart rate and overall mean heart rate (Mesor), could reflect a heightened state of physiological stress or arousal that is frequently observed in individuals experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Conversely, some factors might typically be associated with lower depressive symptomatology, such as average perceived stress, minimal substance use, and engagement in regular exercise and social activities. Objectively, the participant also demonstrates consistent sleep patterns and a robust 24-hour circadian rhythm. However, the strong correlations and the extreme Z-scores of the indicators of psychological distress (STAI, Self-Esteem, Happiness, Health Satisfaction) appear to outweigh these potentially protective factors. The presence of consistent sleep timing and a robust circadian rhythm does not negate the self-reported sleep disturbance, and the extreme psychological discomfort is likely to override the benefits of the positive behavioral habits in influencing the CES-D score.

Considering the magnitude and strong correlations of the negative psychological indicators, particularly trait anxiety and self-esteem, the cumulative evidence points to a substantial depressive symptom burden.

The participant presents with a psychological profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety and significantly reduced self-esteem and happiness, all of which are strongly or moderately correlated with depressive symptom severity. Specifically, their STAI (Trait Anxiety) score (Z-score 0.96) indicates an anxious disposition relative to the study population, and their self-esteem (Z-score -1.57) and self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) are markedly lower than average. Perceived stress (Z-score 0.38) is slightly above the population mean, and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.11) is also notably low. Furthermore, the participant reports lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1).

A prominent pattern of sleep disturbance is evident from both self-report and wearable data. The participant reported extremely poor subjective sleep quality on the PSQI (score 16.0, Z-score 4.29), indicating clinically significant sleep difficulties. Objectively, their median nightly sleep duration is significantly shorter than the population average (6 hours 25 minutes, Z-score -0.96). This short sleep duration is coupled with considerable variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 145 minutes, Z-score 1.0) and sleep start times (standard deviation of 95 minutes, Z-score 0.26), suggesting a highly irregular sleep schedule. These objective and subjective sleep metrics align with common indicators of dysregulated sleep patterns often observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms, with sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability showing positive correlations with the CES-D score.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal a state of heightened baseline arousal and compromised circadian rhythmicity. The participant exhibits a higher-than-average resting heart rate (67.5 bpm, Z-score 1.11) and a higher overall mean heart rate (MESOR of 80.18, Z-score 0.85) across the recording period, both positively correlated with the CES-D score. This suggests an elevated cardiovascular baseline. Analysis of the heart rate-based circadian rhythm indicates lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and a reduced amplitude (Z-score -0.63) of the heart rate rhythm, suggesting less robust and consistent daily physiological patterning. While the hourly heart rate data show a typical diurnal pattern with lowest rates in the early morning and peaks in the afternoon (acrophase at 3:51 PM), the relatively higher heart rates observed between 6-8 AM compared to the study population for those specific hours (despite being below the participant's own daily average) may indicate a less profound physiological recovery during the late sleep phase or an earlier onset of physiological activity compared to peers.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a high level of physical activity, notably engaging in sports and exercising with others more frequently than the average student (Z-scores 1.58 and 1.23, respectively). This sustained physical activity, while generally a protective factor, does not appear to fully mitigate the pervasive psychological distress. In contrast, social engagement (socializing with friends, Z-score -0.62) is reported as below average. The participant spends a substantial amount of time on solitary recreational activities such as listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and reading (Z-score 2.28), with time spent listening to music showing a moderate positive correlation with CES-D. Substance use is notably absent across all categories.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

The collective evidence strongly indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom burden is likely in the top half of the study population distribution. Multiple self-report measures show significant deviations from the mean in directions typically associated with elevated depressive symptoms, and many of these are strongly correlated with CES-D scores. The participant reports markedly high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.96, correlation 0.81), very low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.57, correlation -0.7), and significantly reduced happiness (Happy Z-score -1.61, correlation -0.46). Furthermore, the participant exhibits extreme subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z-score 4.29), which is a cardinal symptom of depression. Objectively, sleep duration is short (Z-score -0.96) and highly variable (Sleep Duration SD Z-score 1.0, correlation 0.19), with high variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.26, correlation 0.22), all pointing to sleep dysregulation commonly associated with depression. Physiological markers such as elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.11, correlation 0.19) and higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.85, correlation 0.19) suggest a state of chronic physiological arousal, which can accompany depressive states. Finally, behavioral patterns such as reduced social interaction (Socializing with Friends Z-score -0.62) and high engagement in solitary activities like listening to music (Z-score 2.06, correlation 0.24) can also be indicative of withdrawal or coping strategies in the context of depressive symptomatology.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

Evidence suggesting a low or median CES-D score is relatively weak in comparison to the indicators of high symptomatology. The participant reports no substance usage, which is generally a protective factor; however, the correlations with CES-D are negligible (-0.05 to 0.16). High levels of physical activity and sports engagement (Exercised with Others Z-score 1.23, Sports Z-score 1.58) are also generally considered protective against depression. While these activities show weak negative correlations with CES-D, their presence does not appear to sufficiently offset the severity of other psychological and physiological indicators. Perceived stress (PSS Z-score 0.38) is only slightly elevated, and some wearable circadian rhythm metrics (Interdaily Stability Z-score -0.9, Amplitude Z-score -0.63, Intradaily Variability Z-score 0.6) show weak or no correlations with CES-D, making their contribution to indicating a low CES-D score minimal or ambiguous in this context.

**Holistic Conclusion:**

Synthesizing the multimodal data, the pervasive pattern of severe psychological distress, profound sleep disturbances, and elevated physiological arousal strongly indicates a high burden of depressive symptoms. The compelling magnitude of negative self-report measures (e.g., extremely low self-esteem and happiness, very high trait anxiety, and severe sleep quality issues), coupled with objective sleep irregularities and elevated physiological markers, far outweighs the limited evidence for lower symptom burden. The protective factors, such as high physical activity and absence of substance use, appear insufficient to mitigate the overall severity of the symptomatology. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top 50% of the study population distribution.

66047,46.0,0.9948186528497409,"The participant’s self-reported psychological and behavioral data, combined with objective wearable-derived physiological metrics, reveal a pattern consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology and associated distress. Key indicators suggest significant challenges in emotional regulation, self-perception, and overall well-being.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notably compromised psychological state across multiple self-report measures. The STAI-Trait score is exceptionally high (73.0, Z-score 3.13), indicating a severe level of chronic anxiety, which correlates strongly and positively with CES-D scores in the study population (r = 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is remarkably low (21.0, Z-score -2.42), a factor strongly and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = -0.7). Self-reported happiness is significantly below average (2.0, Z-score -1.61), while perceived stress is moderately elevated (24.0, Z-score 0.65). Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is critically low (1.22, Z-score -2.28). This confluence of high anxiety, low self-esteem, reduced happiness, and dissatisfaction with health represents a significant burden on the participant's psychological well-being.

Sleep patterns present a notable area of concern. Subjectively, the participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, with a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52). Objectively, wearable data indicates an average median sleep duration of 7 hours 15 minutes, but a significantly late median sleep start time of 02:40:59. Additionally, the participant reports a substantially higher frequency of daily napping (0.28, Z-score 2.4), which may indicate chronic fatigue or an attempt to compensate for poor nocturnal sleep quality. Heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics further highlight disruptions, with a late acrophase at 6:35 PM, suggesting a significant phase delay in the cardiovascular rhythm, and a slightly reduced amplitude (Z-score -0.31), indicating a less pronounced daily variation in heart rate compared to the population. While interdaily stability and intradaily variability are within average ranges, the combination of subjective poor sleep, late sleep onset, increased napping, and a delayed circadian peak points to a dysregulated sleep-wake cycle.

Behavioral habits largely reflect a sedentary lifestyle with reduced engagement in physical activity. The participant's frequency of exercising alone (Z-score -1.18), exercising with others (Z-score -1.58), and participating in sports (Z-score -1.09) are all significantly below the study population average. In contrast, engagement in passive recreational activities is exceptionally high, with more than four hours spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 3.17) and using the internet (Z-score 2.19). Concurrently, participation in other activities like listening to music (Z-score -1.19) and reading (Z-score -0.67) is below average. Socializing with friends is reported as average (Z-score 0.16). This pattern of low physical activity and high sedentary screen time is often associated with lower energy levels and potential social disengagement, which can perpetuate or exacerbate depressive symptoms.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits indicators of elevated baseline arousal and a dysregulated autonomic state. The resting heart rate is notably elevated (68.4 bpm, Z-score 1.22), and the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is also above average (80.2 bpm, Z-score 0.85). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor further supports a disrupted pattern. The heart rate is notably higher than the population's deviation from mesor during the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score 1.34), which may suggest activity or arousal during typical sleep periods, aligning with the late sleep start time and disturbed subjective sleep. During traditional morning hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score -1.24), heart rate deviation from mesor is lower than the population, which, when coupled with the late acrophase and late sleep onset, indicates a physiological rhythm that is misaligned with conventional diurnal activity patterns.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
*   **Profound Psychological Distress:** The exceptionally high STAI score (Z-score 3.13) indicating severe anxiety, coupled with extremely low self-esteem (Z-score -2.42) and significantly reduced happiness (Z-score -1.61), are all strongly and adversely correlated with CES-D scores. These factors alone suggest a high likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms.
*   **Significant Sleep Disturbance and Circadian Misalignment:** The PSQI score of 10.0 indicates clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance. Objectively, the very late median sleep start time, significantly increased napping frequency (Z-score 2.4), and a delayed heart rate acrophase (6:35 PM) strongly point to circadian disruption and poor sleep quality, known associations with depression.
*   **Unhealthy Behavioral Patterns:** The participant exhibits markedly low engagement in all forms of exercise (e.g., Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58) and excessively high engagement in sedentary screen-based activities (TV/Videos Z-score 3.17, Internet Usage Z-score 2.19). Such behavioral patterns are commonly observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms and can contribute to a decline in mood and energy.
*   **Elevated Physiological Arousal:** A higher resting heart rate (Z-score 1.22) and an elevated mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.85) suggest increased physiological stress or sympathetic activation, which can be linked to psychological distress, including depression. The atypical hourly heart rate patterns during the night and morning further support a disrupted physiological state.
*   **Low Health Satisfaction:** The extremely low health satisfaction score (Z-score -2.28) is also moderately correlated with higher CES-D scores.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
*   Few metrics suggest a low or average CES-D score. Average sleep duration, average interdaily stability, intradaily variability, and average social engagement (1-2 hours) are not indicative of severe dysfunction in these specific areas. Low substance usage is a protective factor. However, these factors are outweighed by the strong and numerous indicators of distress.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
The cumulative evidence from self-report surveys and wearable metrics strongly indicates a high burden of depressive symptomatology. The severity of anxiety, low self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, combined with significant sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, reduced physical activity, and elevated physiological arousal, provides compelling support for a CES-D score in the upper half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by a blend of psychological strengths and vulnerabilities, coupled with specific behavioral patterns and well-regulated physiological rhythms. In terms of psychological well-being, the participant reports lower-than-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.43, classified as 'not anxious') and lower perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.71). Both of these measures have positive correlations with the CES-D score (0.81 and 0.28, respectively), suggesting a potential buffering effect against depressive symptomatology. Additionally, the participant reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D (r = -0.39). However, several indicators point towards potential psychological vulnerabilities: self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17), with a strong negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.71); self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score = -0.53), negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46). A particularly salient finding is the participant's significantly low level of interpersonal trust (Z-score = -1.42), which also holds a negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.41), suggesting this may be a significant area of concern related to mental well-being.

Sleep patterns reveal a notable discrepancy between objective measurement and subjective experience. While the participant self-reports 'Disturbed Sleep' according to the PSQI (Score = 6.0), the objective wearable data indicates robust sleep. The participant exhibits a significantly longer median sleep duration (8 hours 18 minutes, Z-score = 1.39) and greater consistency in both sleep duration (Z-score = -0.35) and sleep start times (Z-score = -0.68) compared to the study population. The absence of napping (Z-score = -0.86) further supports a pattern of consolidated nocturnal sleep. This divergence suggests that despite objectively adequate and consistent sleep, the participant's subjective perception of sleep quality is compromised, which can be an important indicator of psychological distress.

Analysis of wearable-derived heart rate data indicates a well-structured and stable physiological circadian rhythm. The participant displays an above-average autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.64) and an above-average heart rate amplitude (Z-score = 0.56), signifying a clear and robust daily rhythm with distinct peaks and troughs. Intradaily variability is notably lower than average (Z-score = -0.95), while interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.33), suggesting overall consistency in the daily heart rate pattern with less minute-to-minute fluctuation. The resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.62) is lower than the population average, often indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rate substantially below the mesor during sleep and elevated during waking hours. Specifically, heart rate deviations are notably higher than the population average during late afternoon and evening periods (e.g., 6-7 PM Z-score = 1.36; 9-10 PM Z-score = 1.61), which may reflect periods of heightened physiological arousal or activity.

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant exhibits several areas of concern. Alcohol consumption, specifically of wine or liquor, is notably high (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score = 1.68). Exercise levels are consistently very low across all categories, with engagement in exercising alone, exercising with others, and sports all significantly below population averages (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.58), indicating a largely sedentary lifestyle. Engagement in daily recreational activities is also generally below average for several pursuits, including reading, video games, listening to music, and sedentary hobbies. In contrast, time spent socializing with friends and using the internet is close to the population average. This behavioral pattern, marked by low physical activity and reduced engagement in diverse recreational pursuits, could be indicative of anhedonia or reduced motivation, which are common features of depressive symptomatology.

To determine whether the participant's CES-D score likely falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we weigh the available evidence, particularly considering the strength and direction of correlations with CES-D.

**Evidence for a lower or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant reports lower-than-average anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.43), which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), suggesting that lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, perceived stress is notably low (PSS Z-score = -0.71) and positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.28). Higher satisfaction with health (Z-score = 0.55) is also a protective factor, given its negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.39). Objectively, the participant demonstrates significantly long sleep duration and consistent sleep patterns, along with a robust and stable heart rate-based circadian rhythm, which are generally associated with better mental health outcomes.

**Evidence for a higher CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, several factors strongly suggest a predisposition towards elevated depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits below-average self-esteem (Z-score = -0.17), which carries a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), implying lower self-esteem is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score = -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46). A particularly impactful finding is the significantly low interpersonal trust (Z-score = -1.42), which negatively correlates with CES-D (r = -0.41). Furthermore, despite objective sleep adequacy, the self-report of ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (Score = 6.0) indicates a subjective experience of sleep problems, a common depressive symptom. Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly sedentary lifestyle with consistently very low levels of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.58) and reduced engagement in several recreational activities, which can be behavioral manifestations of anhedonia or low energy. The notably high consumption of wine or liquor, while not strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset, could also be a maladaptive coping mechanism.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits protective factors such as lower anxiety, lower perceived stress, and robust physiological sleep and circadian rhythms, the cumulative weight of evidence points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The strong correlational indicators of lower self-esteem, lower happiness, and especially significantly low interpersonal trust are highly salient. These psychological vulnerabilities, coupled with the participant's subjective experience of disturbed sleep (despite objective metrics), a significantly sedentary lifestyle, and reduced engagement in pleasurable activities, align more closely with patterns observed in individuals with elevated depressive symptomatology. Therefore, despite some positive indicators, the overall profile suggests that the participant's CES-D score is more likely to fall within the top half of the study population distribution.

33133,31.0,0.9196891191709845,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant demonstrates a complex interplay of psychological traits, physiological patterns, and behavioral habits that warrant detailed consideration. From a psychological standpoint, there is a notable predisposition to anxiety, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 49.0, which is above the population average (Z-score = 0.76) and classified as ""anxious."" This elevated trait anxiety shows a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, suggesting a significant link to depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, the participant reports a below-average level of current happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and experiences above-average perceived stress (Z-score = 0.65). Self-esteem is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.17) and exhibits a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, indicating that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, interpersonal trust is notably lower than the population average (Z-score = -0.78), which also shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D. In contrast to these indicators of psychological distress, the participant reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.8), a factor that is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D and could serve as a protective resource. Academic performance, as reflected by strong GPA metrics, also appears to be a functional area for this individual.

Sleep patterns present a significant area of concern. Subjectively, the participant reports substantial sleep disturbance, evidenced by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0, placing them nearly two standard deviations above the population mean (Z-score = 1.98). Objective wearable data corroborate aspects of poor sleep, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours 38 minutes, which is below the average for the study population (Z-score = -0.68). While the daily variability in sleep duration is lower than average (Z-score = -0.85), indicating consistent *length* of sleep, the median sleep start time is late (00:40:29) and highly inconsistent, with a standard deviation of 101 minutes (Z-score = 0.39). This combination suggests a pattern of chronic sleep deprivation compounded by an irregular sleep schedule, which can disrupt circadian alignment despite consistent, albeit short, sleep durations.

Analysis of circadian rhythms and physiological arousal, derived from heart rate data, reveals distinctive daily patterns. Non-parametric measures indicate slightly below-average interdaily stability and slightly above-average intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.6), suggesting a relatively consistent, but somewhat fragmented, physiological rhythm across days. The most salient feature emerges from the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations: a pronounced and significantly elevated heart rate is observed during the 8-9 AM hour (Z-score = 2.09), representing a robust physiological arousal peak in the early morning. This is followed by a period of lower-than-average heart rate activity in the early afternoon (1-3 PM, Z-scores of -1.5 and -1.72), indicating a subsequent dip in physiological arousal relative to the mesor. Such a strong and potentially dysregulated pattern of morning activation followed by an afternoon trough could be indicative of underlying stress responses or a disrupted autonomic balance.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in above-average alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), though substance use beyond alcohol is reported as absent. Exercise habits are generally robust, with frequent solitary exercise and participation in sports; however, exercising with others is notably absent (Z-score = -1.58). Daily recreational habits include very high internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score = 1.52), which shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D, potentially suggesting a coping mechanism or a pattern of withdrawal. Engagement in other forms of screen time (TV/videos/movies, video games) and reading is below average. Socializing with friends is reported as average, despite the lack of group exercise. This overall pattern suggests a degree of solitary behavior, with high engagement in digital activities and personal exercise, while showing less engagement in shared physical activities.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50% of the study population) is substantial. The participant reports significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = 0.76), which has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Subjective sleep quality is severely disturbed (PSQI Z-score = 1.98), a common correlate of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D, and self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.17) with a strong negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D. Elevated perceived stress (Z-score = 0.65) and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score = -0.78) also align with increased depressive symptomatology. Wearable data indicate chronic short sleep duration and inconsistent sleep start times, which are known risk factors for mood disturbance. The highly exaggerated morning heart rate peak further suggests physiological dysregulation potentially linked to chronic stress or affect dysregulation.

Conversely, there is some evidence that might suggest a lower or average CES-D score. The participant reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.8), which is moderately negatively correlated (-0.4) with CES-D. Consistent engagement in solitary exercise and sports, along with strong academic performance, could serve as protective factors or indicate areas of functional capacity. Additionally, the standard deviation of sleep duration is lower than average, suggesting consistency in the amount of sleep obtained, despite its brevity.

However, the strength and number of indicators pointing towards elevated depressive symptoms significantly outweigh the protective factors. The severity of subjective sleep disturbance, the high trait anxiety, and the below-average self-esteem, all with significant correlations to CES-D, collectively suggest a considerable burden of depressive symptoms. These core psychological and sleep-related issues are commonly associated with depressive states. Therefore, considering the totality of the evidence, particularly the robust and highly correlated self-report measures of distress and sleep disturbance, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
47810,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"The participant’s self-reported psychological profile presents a mixed picture regarding potential depressive symptom burden. They report below-average trait anxiety (STAI score of 37.0, Z-score -0.43) and slightly above-average self-esteem (score 39.0, Z-score 0.11), both of which are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study population. Additionally, their self-reported interpersonal trust is above average (score 3.5, Z-score 0.5), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D. Conversely, the participant indicates significant sleep disturbance, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed."" Their current self-reported happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and satisfaction with physical health (score 3.33, Z-score -0.7) are both below average and show moderate negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting these factors may contribute to an elevated symptom burden. Perceived stress levels are near the population average (score 22.0, Z-score 0.1).

Behaviorally, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) but abstains from beer, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs, with weak correlations to CES-D. Exercise engagement is somewhat above average across categories, including exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports (Z-scores ranging from 0.32 to 0.91), with weak negative correlations to CES-D, suggesting a potential mitigating factor. However, the participant reports notably low engagement in many daily recreational activities, including not watching TV/videos, playing video games, or reading, and below-average time spent socializing with friends or engaging in sedentary hobbies. While the correlations for these activities with CES-D are generally weak, this pattern of disengagement from common recreational pursuits could indicate reduced interest or anhedonia.

Analysis of sleep metrics derived from wearable data corroborates the self-reported sleep disturbance. The participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours and 40 minutes (Z-score -0.65), falling below the population average. A particularly salient finding is the significantly high frequency of daily naps (mean 0.27, Z-score 2.34), which shows a positive correlation (0.21) with CES-D scores. While the variability in sleep duration and sleep start times is around or slightly below average, the overall picture points to insufficient and compensatory sleep patterns.

The participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal significant fragmentation. Interdaily stability is average, but intradaily variability (IV) is notably high at 0.83 (Z-score 2.01), indicating a highly irregular and fragmented daily activity rhythm, which is a common feature in mood disorders. The acrophase, representing the peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:46 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate data show normal dips during typical sleeping hours. However, heart rate deviations above the mesor indicate sustained physiological activity into the late afternoon and evening, with peaks observed between 11 AM-12 PM (Z-score 1.27) and 6 PM-9 PM (Z-scores up to 1.16). This sustained elevation into the evening, coupled with the late acrophase and high intradaily variability, suggests a potentially disrupted and less robust circadian rhythm that could contribute to sleep difficulties and overall physiological dysregulation.

Considering the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest the participant's CES-D score is likely in the top half of the study population. While self-reported trait anxiety, self-esteem, and trust are favorable indicators (suggesting a lower CES-D), these are significantly outweighed by prominent objective and subjective markers of distress and dysfunction. The most compelling evidence for a higher CES-D score includes the clinically significant disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 1.05), below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53), and below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.7). Critically, the wearable data highlight severe sleep and circadian rhythm dysregulation, including below-average sleep duration, an exceptionally high frequency of daily naps (Z-score 2.34), and significantly elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score 2.01). The high frequency of napping is also positively correlated with CES-D scores. These physiological and behavioral disruptions are strong indicators commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology, overcoming the moderating influence of positive self-reported psychological traits.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
58196,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile characterized by low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, indicators typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Their STAI score of 31.0, which is over one standard deviation below the population mean (Z-score -1.02), classifies them as ""not anxious"" and correlates strongly negatively with CES-D scores (0.81). Similarly, a high Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 46.0 (Z-score 1.1) is more than one standard deviation above the mean, correlating negatively with CES-D at -0.71. Self-reported happiness is also markedly high, with a score of 5.0 (Z-score 1.64), indicating a strong positive affect that negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.46). Consistent with these positive indicators, the participant reports ""Good Sleep"" quality with a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), suggesting a lack of subjective sleep disturbance. Furthermore, health satisfaction is high at 6.11 (Z-score 1.38), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.39). The only self-reported psychological measure that is elevated is perceived stress, with a PSS score of 24.0 (Z-score 0.65), placing it above the population average, and showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). This suggests a moderate but not extreme level of perceived stress, which stands in contrast to the otherwise strong positive mental health indicators.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle, frequently engaging in exercise both alone and with others (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-scores 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), which are significantly above population averages and correlate negatively with CES-D. While engagement in organized sports is minimal (Z-score -1.09), the high frequency of general exercise likely provides significant protective benefits against depressive symptoms. Substance use includes moderate alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), which is slightly above average, but there is no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Daily recreational habits reveal a tendency towards very low engagement in common sedentary activities such as watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music, and reading, all with significantly negative Z-scores. Socializing with friends is also reported at a somewhat lower frequency (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62). This pattern suggests a selective lifestyle with a strong emphasis on physical activity and potentially academic pursuits (given high GPA), rather than passive recreation or extensive social engagement. However, the weak or negligible correlations of these recreational habits with CES-D suggest they are not strong direct indicators of depressive symptomatology in this participant.

Sleep patterns, as captured by wearable data, indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours 33 minutes, which is somewhat below the population average (Z-score -0.79). Despite this, the self-reported PSQI score classifies sleep quality as ""Good,"" suggesting the participant does not subjectively experience significant sleep problems. Both sleep duration and sleep start time demonstrate relatively low variability (standard deviations of 82 minutes and 72 minutes respectively, with negative Z-scores), indicating consistent sleep-wake timing across days. The median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:01:59. The participant reports above-average napping behavior (mean daily naps 0.15, Z-score 0.94), which could potentially compensate for the shorter main sleep duration, although napping frequency shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.21).

Physiological data derived from heart rate monitoring reveals a generally well-structured and active circadian rhythm. The participant's average heart rate (Mesor 66.57, Z-score -1.01) and resting heart rate (53.4, Z-score -0.56) are both below population averages, consistent with good cardiovascular fitness, aligning with their high exercise levels. While interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z-score -0.57) and intraday variability is above average (Z-score 0.81), indicating somewhat less regularity and more fragmentation in the heart rate rhythm across the day, the magnitude of these deviations is moderate, and their correlations with CES-D are very weak. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.63), suggesting a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates, which can sometimes be associated with mood disorders, but again, the correlation is weak. The hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate a healthy daily pattern: significantly lower heart rates during nocturnal hours (e.g., -16.06 to -18.47 from 1 AM to 6 AM) indicative of restful sleep, followed by a sharp and sustained increase in heart rate during morning and daytime hours, peaking in the afternoon (e.g., 14.39 at 3-4 PM) and showing elevated activity through the evening. This pattern suggests robust physiological arousal and active engagement throughout the waking day, with appropriate recovery during sleep, largely counteracting any minor concerns from the other circadian metrics.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The overwhelming body of evidence points towards this participant experiencing relatively low or average depressive symptomatology. Psychologically, they report low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.02), high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 1.1), very high happiness (Z-score 1.64), and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26). These factors are strongly and consistently associated with lower CES-D scores, as indicated by their respective negative correlations. Furthermore, the participant exhibits high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.38), another protective factor negatively correlated with CES-D. Behaviorally, a high frequency of exercise (Z-scores above 1.0 for both solo and group exercise) is a well-established buffer against depressive symptoms and shows negative correlations with CES-D. Physiologically, the wearable data demonstrates a robust and active daily heart rate pattern, with low Mesor and Resting Heart Rate, indicative of good fitness and overall cardiovascular health, rather than the physiological dysregulation often associated with depression. The clear distinction between low heart rates during sleep and elevated rates during waking hours reflects a healthy sleep-wake cycle and active engagement.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a higher CES-D score is minimal and considerably weaker. The participant reports moderately elevated perceived stress (PSS Z-score 0.65), which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Wearable data indicates slightly shorter median sleep duration (Z-score -0.79) and an above-average frequency of napping (Z-score 0.94), with the latter showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Some circadian rhythm metrics, such as slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.57) and amplitude (Z-score -0.63), and higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.81), could be considered very minor indicators of less optimal rhythmicity. Additionally, lower engagement in sedentary leisure activities and somewhat reduced socializing time, although weakly correlated with CES-D, might in some contexts suggest reduced interest or social withdrawal. However, given the participant's high academic achievement (high GPA) and high physical activity levels, these leisure activity patterns might simply reflect a different prioritization of time. Crucially, the correlations for these weaker indicators with CES-D are either negligible or very weak, suggesting they do not play a significant role in predicting depressive symptoms in this individual or population.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the extensive evidence for psychological well-being, healthy lifestyle behaviors (particularly exercise), and robust physiological rhythms strongly outweighs the minor, weakly correlated indicators that might suggest elevated depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits key psychological traits (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, good sleep quality, good health satisfaction) that are highly protective against depression. Their consistent high levels of physical activity further support a positive mental health profile. While minor deviations in sleep duration, napping frequency, or subtle aspects of circadian rhythm regularity exist, they are not severe, and more importantly, they are contradicted by the subjective experience of ""Good Sleep"" and the overall dynamic and responsive heart rate patterns throughout the day. Therefore, considering the totality and relative strength of the evidence, the participant's depressive symptom burden is most likely low or average for the student population.

62246,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a comprehensive profile indicative of robust psychological well-being, healthy behavioral patterns, and well-regulated physiological functions. Self-report measures show a notable absence of anxiety, with a STAI-Trait score placing the individual significantly below the population mean (Z-score -0.82), consistent with a ""not anxious"" classification. Concurrently, self-esteem is remarkably high (Z-score 0.96), a trait strongly and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is excellent (score 3.0, Z-score -1.72), indicating a ""Good Sleep"" pattern which is a significant protective factor against depression. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score -0.17), and health satisfaction is above average (Z-score 0.63). While self-reported happiness is slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.53), this moderate deviation does not align with a pattern of elevated depressive symptomatology given the strength of other positive indicators, including consistently high academic performance (GPA nearing 3.9).

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in exercise both alone and with others at frequencies significantly above the population average (Z-scores 1.07 and 0.53 respectively) and participating in sports regularly (Z-score 0.91). Such high levels of physical activity are generally associated with improved mood and reduced risk of depressive symptoms. Substance usage patterns include above-average alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94), but recreational or non-prescribed drug use is absent. The participant reports less engagement in passive recreational activities like watching TV or listening to music, instead showing average engagement in internet usage and socializing. These activity preferences, particularly the high level of exercise, contribute to a generally healthy behavioral repertoire.

Wearable-derived sleep statistics corroborate the self-reported excellent sleep quality. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 39 minutes is above the population average (Z-score 0.59), reflecting adequate restorative sleep. Furthermore, the low standard deviation in sleep duration (65 minutes, Z-score -0.82) indicates consistent sleep timing, which is a hallmark of healthy sleep hygiene. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further suggests sufficient nocturnal sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data reveal a robust and stable physiological rhythm. Notably, intradaily variability is very low (Z-score -1.59), suggesting highly consolidated periods of activity and rest throughout the day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is above average (Z-score 0.47), indicating a clear distinction between peak and trough activity levels, further reinforcing a strong and well-entrained circadian pacemaker. The mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.56), with the acrophase (peak physiological activity) occurring in the mid-afternoon around 4:23 PM.

Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor demonstrates a pronounced and healthy diurnal pattern of cardiovascular activity. During typical nocturnal hours (approximately 1 AM to 7 AM), the participant’s heart rate shows substantial negative deviations, falling considerably below the mesor, with the lowest point around 5-6 AM (e.g., -23.21 bpm, Z-score -0.7). This deep nocturnal trough signifies effective physiological rest. Conversely, during the day, heart rate consistently rises above the mesor, with a significant peak in the mid-afternoon (e.g., 14.47 bpm above mesor between 2-3 PM, Z-score 1.37). This indicates a robust level of physiological arousal and activity during waking hours. The resting heart rate of 57.0 bpm (Z-score -0.14) is healthy, further supporting good cardiovascular fitness. This distinct and well-regulated heart rate rhythm, characterized by substantial amplitude between resting and active phases, strongly supports a state of physiological well-being and adaptive functioning.

55424,35.0,0.9637305699481865,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by significant self-reported psychological distress, particularly concerning anxiety, self-esteem, and subjective sleep quality. The STAI-Trait scale indicates an elevated level of chronic anxiety, with a score of 57.0 (Z-score 1.55), placing the individual considerably above the population average and strongly correlating with higher depressive symptoms (0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably lower than the mean (Score 32.0, Z-Score -0.87), a factor highly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71). Subjective happiness is also significantly below the population average (Score 2.0, Z-Score -1.61), indicating a pronounced experience of low mood, which aligns with potential depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is slightly above average (Score 23.0, Z-Score 0.38), further contributing to a picture of general psychological strain.

Sleep patterns reveal a critical area of concern, as evidenced by a remarkably high Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 14.0 (Z-Score 3.37), classifying the participant's subjective sleep as ""Disturbed."" This indicates severe difficulties with sleep quality and related issues. Interestingly, objective wearable data for sleep duration shows a slightly above-average median sleep of 7 hours and 24 minutes (Z-Score 0.27), with relatively low variability in both sleep duration (Z-Score -0.72) and sleep start time (Z-Score -0.54). This suggests a discrepancy between objectively consistent sleep patterns and the participant's subjective experience of poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the participant engages in significantly more daily napping than the average (Z-Score 1.9), which could be a compensatory behavior for poor nocturnal sleep or a symptom of excessive daytime fatigue.

Physiological data derived from heart rate metrics indicate a relatively well-structured circadian rhythm. The mesor heart rate is average (Z-Score -0.13), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is slightly above average (Z-Score 0.34), suggesting a clear distinction between peak and trough heart rate periods. The acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 3:36 PM, which aligns with observed hourly heart rate deviations showing highest activity levels from 3 PM to 8 PM (with Z-scores peaking at 1.44 at 7-8 PM). A distinct and rapid decline in physiological arousal is observed in the late evening (e.g., 11-12 AM, Z-Score -2.02), indicating a clear physiological wind-down towards bedtime. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability are within average ranges, suggesting a consistent day-to-day rhythm and typical fluctuation within days, respectively. The resting heart rate is also average (Z-Score -0.07). These objective physiological measures of circadian rhythmicity do not directly reflect dysfunction, but rather point to a structured physiological rhythm that coexists with significant subjective sleep disturbance and psychological distress.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a strong engagement in exercise with others (Z-Score 1.23), a habit frequently associated with positive mental health outcomes and negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.24). However, this contrasts with a lower-than-average reported time spent socializing with friends (Z-Score -0.62), suggesting that social interaction may be primarily structured around physical activity rather than broader leisure-time social engagement. The participant also allocates above-average time to passive, sedentary hobbies (Z-Score 0.82) and watching TV/videos (Z-Score 0.64), while engagement in other recreational activities such as reading, video games, and listening to music is below average. Notably, internet usage, despite being below average (Z-Score -0.49), shows a positive correlation with CES-D (0.26), suggesting that the specific nature or context of this activity might not be beneficial for the participant's mental well-being. Substance use is low and within average population norms, indicating it is not a primary contributing factor to the observed psychological profile.

In synthesis, the participant presents a compelling case of significant subjective psychological burden, marked by high anxiety, low self-esteem, reduced happiness, and severe sleep disturbance, despite objectively regular sleep patterns and physiological circadian rhythms. While engagement in social exercise offers a potential protective factor, increased reliance on passive sedentary activities and potentially isolated forms of social interaction may either reflect or contribute to the participant's psychological state. The profound self-reported distress, especially concerning sleep and anxiety, stands out as the most salient indicator of potential depressive symptoms.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The STAI-Trait score of 57.0 (Z-score 1.55) classifies the participant as anxious, and this measure has a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. A substantial PSQI score of 14.0 (Z-score 3.37) indicates severe subjective sleep disturbance, a cardinal symptom frequently co-occurring with or exacerbating depression. Self-esteem is notably low (Z-score -0.87), which is highly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), and current happiness is significantly below average (Z-score -1.61), with a negative correlation of -0.45. Additionally, the participant's significantly higher napping frequency (Z-score 1.9) suggests underlying fatigue or sleep regulation issues. Slightly elevated perceived stress (Z-score 0.38) and above-average engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 0.82) also positively correlate with CES-D. These factors, particularly the extreme values for anxiety, sleep disturbance, self-esteem, and happiness, point to a considerable burden of depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Some aspects of the participant's profile could be considered protective or indicative of relatively lower depressive symptoms. The participant engages significantly more in exercise with others (Z-score 1.23), a behavior known to be associated with better mental health and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.24). Objective sleep data shows lower variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.72) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.54), suggesting a degree of regularity in sleep schedules, which can be beneficial. Health satisfaction (Z-score 0.38) and interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.18) are slightly above average and negatively correlated with CES-D, potentially acting as minor buffers. Furthermore, objective wearable heart rate data suggests a stable and robust physiological circadian rhythm, with an average resting heart rate and typical interdaily stability and intradaily variability.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite some potentially protective factors such as regular objective sleep timing, engagement in social exercise, and stable physiological circadian rhythms, the overall balance of evidence strongly indicates an elevated depressive symptom burden. The magnitude of distress captured by self-report measures, particularly the extremely high anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance scores, coupled with low self-esteem and happiness, are direct and powerful indicators of increased depressive symptomatology. The correlations of these measures with CES-D scores further reinforce this interpretation. The objective sleep and circadian rhythm metrics, while indicating physiological regulation, do not negate the profound subjective experience of poor sleep quality and general psychological distress. Given the high Z-scores and strong correlations of the primary mental health indicators (STAI, PSQI, Self-Esteem, Happy), it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score would fall into the upper half of the study population distribution.

23576,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by strong psychological protective factors, highly regular physiological rhythms, and robust objective sleep and exercise habits, alongside some indications of lower subjective happiness and disturbed subjective sleep quality.

Psychologically, the participant reports significantly lower anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72) and markedly higher self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.96) compared to the study population. These factors, particularly high self-esteem, are strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, suggesting a resilient psychological foundation. Perceived stress levels are slightly below average (PSS Z-score: -0.17), further contributing to a generally favorable mental health profile. Additionally, the participant demonstrates above-average health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.72) and interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores. However, self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score: -0.53), which stands as a contrasting point within an otherwise positive self-report of well-being. Academically, the participant maintains an excellent GPA across academic semesters, indicating strong academic functioning.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a healthy lifestyle with no reported substance usage across categories, which is considerably lower than the population average. Engagement in physical activity is high, with frequent exercise both alone and with others, as well as participation in sports, all exceeding population averages. This active lifestyle is generally associated with better mental health outcomes. Leisure activities show a preference for screen-based entertainment, with above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score: 1.71), while engagement in reading and listening to music is below average. This pattern suggests a somewhat sedentary leisure profile despite high physical activity.

Wearable data reveals a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.5) and, notably, 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: 1.06) are above average, indicating consistent daily patterns in heart rate activity. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.24), suggesting some fragmentation within daily activity/rest cycles. The average heart rate (Mesor Z-score: -0.35) and resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.07) are near or slightly below the population mean, which is generally favorable. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed at 4:05 PM, indicating a somewhat later peak in daily physiological arousal. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a clear and typical diurnal fluctuation, with lower rates during nighttime and elevated rates during waking hours, although specific periods like late morning (10-11 AM) show higher-than-average heart rate and early evening (6-7 PM) show lower-than-average heart rate relative to the population.

Sleep patterns, as captured by wearable devices, are characterized by both sufficiency and remarkable consistency. The participant’s median sleep duration of 7 hours and 46 minutes is above the population average (Z-score: 0.72). Furthermore, both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.98) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.83) exhibit very low standard deviations, signifying highly consistent sleep schedules. The participant also reports no daily naps, which is less than the population average (Z-score: -0.86). Despite these strong objective indicators of healthy and consistent sleep, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" even though this score is slightly better than the population average (Z-score: -0.33). This discrepancy suggests a subjective experience of sleep quality issues that are not fully reflected in the objective measures of duration and consistency.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Bottom 50% (Low or Median Depressive Symptomatology):**
The majority of the participant's data points strongly indicate a low or median CES-D score. Critically, the participant reports significantly lower anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72), which has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, meaning lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is notably high (RSES Z-score: 0.96) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), suggesting robust protection against depressive symptomatology. Other protective self-report measures include slightly below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.17) and above-average health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.72) and interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83), all of which are negatively correlated with CES-D.
Behaviorally, the participant maintains consistent high academic performance (GPA), demonstrates no substance use, and engages in high levels of physical activity, all factors generally associated with lower depressive burden. Objectively measured sleep statistics from Fitbit show above-average sleep duration and exceptionally high consistency in both sleep duration and sleep start time, indicating a stable and healthy sleep schedule. Consistent sleep is widely recognized as a protective factor against depression, and the strong negative Z-scores for sleep duration and start time variability, coupled with their positive correlations with CES-D, further support a lower CES-D score. Circadian rhythms are highly stable and regular, as indicated by high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, which typically aligns with better mental well-being. The slightly lower Mesor value also correlates positively with CES-D, meaning the participant's lower Mesor is favorable.

**Evidence for Top 50% (Elevated Depressive Symptomatology):**
Evidence suggesting a higher CES-D score is comparatively limited. The participant's self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score: -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), implying this aspect could contribute to a higher CES-D score. Additionally, despite objectively sound sleep, the participant's PSQI score of 6.0 classifies subjective sleep as ""Disturbed,"" which is a common feature of depressive states, even if their PSQI Z-score is slightly better than the population average. Some leisure activities, specifically high screen time (Watching TV/Videos/Movies Z=1.28, Video Games Z=1.71), have mild positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting a potential link.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the participant's depressive symptom burden is likely low to average within the study population. The robust protective factors identified—high self-esteem, low anxiety, consistent exercise, and exceptionally regular and sufficient objective sleep—are highly influential and directly correlate with lower CES-D scores. While lower self-reported happiness and subjective sleep disturbance are noted, they are significantly outweighed by the strength and consistency of the mitigating factors across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains. Therefore, the participant is most likely to fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

93485,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The following analysis provides an interpretation of the participant's psychological state, depressive symptoms, and behavioral patterns, drawing insights from self-reported surveys and wearable-derived metrics.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a favorable profile across several key psychological traits and maintains healthy lifestyle patterns. Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score 35.0, Z-score -0.62) is notably below the study population average, indicating lower chronic anxiety proneness. This is further supported by a higher-than-average self-esteem score (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 44.0, Z-score 0.82), a factor strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Perceived stress (PSS score 20.0, Z-score -0.44) is also lower than the mean, suggesting effective stress appraisal. These indicators collectively suggest a resilient psychological disposition. However, the participant's self-reported current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) is below the population average, and this metric holds a moderate negative correlation with CES-D, indicating that lower happiness is typically associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction, conversely, is remarkably high (score 6.67, Z-score 1.8), suggesting strong positive perceptions of physical well-being, which is negatively correlated with CES-D.

Sleep patterns appear largely healthy and well-regulated. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is good (score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), falling below the threshold for clinically significant disturbance and indicating better sleep than average. Objective Fitbit data further supports this, showing an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 1 minute (Z-score -0.2) with lower-than-average variability in sleep duration (SD 70 minutes, Z-score -0.69). Napping is also absent (Z-score -0.86), indicating a consistent nighttime sleep pattern. The physiological circadian rhythm, derived from heart rate data, demonstrates strong regularity and amplitude. Interdaily stability (0.53, Z-score 1.0) is higher than average, reflecting consistent daily patterns. Most notably, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (16.65, Z-score 1.9) is substantially elevated, signifying a robust and well-defined physiological rhythm with a clear distinction between active and rest phases. The acrophase, or peak activity, is observed at 4:00 PM. Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations from the mesor corroborate these findings, revealing pronounced drops below the mesor during typical sleep hours (e.g., -32.15 at 4-5 AM, Z-score -2.33) and significant elevations above the mesor during daytime hours, particularly peaking around 1-2 PM (+20.84, Z-score 2.22), indicative of a healthy and active daily physiological cycle. This robust circadian profile, alongside an exceptionally low resting heart rate of 47.3 bpm (Z-score -1.29), suggests high cardiovascular fitness and efficient physiological regulation.

The participant's lifestyle includes regular physical activity and moderate social engagement. Solo exercise is frequent (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.07), suggesting a preference for individual fitness pursuits, though engagement in exercise with others (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score -0.88) and sports (""Not at all,"" Z-score -1.09) is below average. While lower social exercise could potentially indicate reduced social interaction, the overall exercise level is robust, and the correlation with CES-D is weak negative. Recreational screen time and sedentary hobbies are notably low, with ""Do not do"" responses for watching TV/videos (Z-score -1.25), video games (Z-score -0.56), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96), suggesting an active engagement with non-sedentary pursuits. Internet usage and socializing with friends are within average ranges. Alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week) is higher than average, but recreational or non-prescribed drug use is absent. Overall, the participant presents with a generally healthy and active behavioral profile.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence supports the conclusion that the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population. Psychologically, the participant reports significantly lower trait anxiety (Z-score -0.62, strongly positively correlated with CES-D) and notably higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.82, strongly negatively correlated with CES-D). Perceived stress is also below average (Z-score -0.44), and satisfaction with physical health is remarkably high (Z-score 1.8), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Sleep quality, both subjectively reported (PSQI Z-score -0.8, classified as ""Good Sleep"") and objectively measured (average duration, low variability, no napping), indicates healthy sleep patterns, which are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. Physiologically, the wearable data consistently points to a highly robust and healthy profile: an exceptionally low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.29) indicative of high cardiovascular fitness, a significantly high amplitude in heart rate circadian rhythm (Z-score 1.9), and higher interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0), all suggesting well-regulated physiological functioning less common in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. The hourly heart rate patterns also show clear, strong diurnal variation, characteristic of healthy activity and rest cycles. Behavioral habits reinforce this, with frequent solo exercise and very low engagement in passive recreational activities.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The primary piece of evidence that might suggest a higher CES-D score is the participant's self-reported current happiness, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.53). Given its moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), lower happiness would typically be associated with a higher CES-D score. Additionally, the participant reports lower-than-average engagement in exercise with others and sports activities (Z-scores -0.88 and -1.09, respectively). While these aspects have weak negative correlations with CES-D, some interpretations might associate reduced social engagement with higher depressive symptoms, though this is largely counteracted by high levels of solo exercise. Intradaily variability in heart rate is moderately higher (Z-score 0.46), which can sometimes indicate fragmented activity, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.05), limiting its interpretive weight.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite the slightly lower self-reported happiness, the overwhelming majority of indicators point towards a strong profile of resilience and well-being. The combined evidence from low anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep quality, low stress, high health satisfaction, excellent physical fitness, and robust, well-regulated physiological circadian rhythms strongly suggests a lower burden of depressive symptomatology. The correlations for anxiety and self-esteem are particularly strong and align with a lower CES-D score. Therefore, the participant's overall CES-D score is highly likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
62617,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile indicates a positive and resilient mental state. They report significantly lower levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31, classified as 'not anxious') and perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -1.26), both of which show positive correlations with CES-D, thus suggesting a lower depressive symptom burden. Complementing these, the participant exhibits notably higher self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.24), higher interpersonal trust (Z-score: 1.47), and elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64) compared to the study population. These positive traits all carry moderate to strong negative correlations with CES-D, further supporting an association with lower depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score: 0.38) and negatively correlated with CES-D.

Both self-reported and wearable sleep metrics consistently point towards healthy sleep patterns. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0, Z-score: -0.8), classifying their sleep as ""Good Sleep"" and indicating a better-than-average subjective experience. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a significantly longer median sleep duration of 8 hours and 25 minutes (Z-score: 1.53), along with slightly less variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 78 minutes, Z-score: -0.51) and sleep start times (standard deviation 70 minutes, Z-score: -0.28). The absence of daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) further contributes to a regular sleep profile. While correlations between specific sleep metrics and CES-D are generally weak, the overall pattern of sufficient and relatively consistent sleep duration is typically associated with better mental health outcomes.

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics presents a mixed picture. The participant exhibits significantly lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.73) and intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.45), suggesting less day-to-day consistency in their heart rate rhythm and a less dynamic physiological response throughout the day. This ""flattening"" is further supported by a lower amplitude (Z-score: -1.01), indicating a reduced peak-to-trough variation in heart rate over 24 hours. The participant’s mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.58). In terms of aggregated hourly heart rate, the participant shows a relatively less pronounced drop in heart rate during the deepest sleep hours (e.g., 4-5 AM, Z-score: 0.84 for deviation from mesor), indicating a somewhat elevated heart rate during sleep compared to the population mean. While their heart rate begins to rise relatively earlier in the morning (6-7 AM, Z-score: 1.2), they also show a significantly blunted physiological response during midday (12-1 PM, Z-score: -1.32 for deviation from mesor), with heart rate staying closer to the mesor than typical. The peak heart rate deviation occurs in the evening (7-10 PM). The combination of a higher mesor, lower amplitude, and less dynamic hourly fluctuations, particularly during midday, may reflect some blunted autonomic flexibility or altered physiological arousal patterns. A lower amplitude and higher mesor have weak correlations with higher CES-D scores.

The participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, engaging in exercise alone three times a week or more (Z-score: 1.07), exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.53), and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91). Notably, exercising with others has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23), suggesting a protective effect. In terms of digital habits, the participant reports significantly less internet usage (Z-score: -1.16) and listening to music (Z-score: -1.19). Given that these activities show moderate positive correlations with CES-D, lower engagement in these behaviors is associated with lower depressive symptoms in this study population. They also report no engagement in sedentary hobbies. Alcohol consumption includes wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above average (Z-score: 0.94), but recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Overall, the active lifestyle and reduced engagement in certain digital/sedentary recreational activities are behavioral patterns generally associated with positive mental health and, where correlated, with lower CES-D scores.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The overwhelming majority of the participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral data provides strong evidence for a relatively low depressive symptom burden, suggesting a CES-D score in the bottom 50th percentile of the study population (which is <= 11.5). The participant demonstrates low anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.31, correlation with CES-D: 0.81), high self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.24, correlation: -0.71), high happiness (Z-score: 1.64, correlation: -0.46), low stress (PSS Z-score: -1.26, correlation: 0.28), and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -0.8). These self-report measures are highly correlated with CES-D in the direction of lower depressive symptoms. Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a highly active lifestyle with frequent exercise, including exercising with others (Z-score: 0.53, correlation: -0.23), and significantly less internet usage (Z-score: -1.16, correlation: 0.25) and music listening (Z-score: -1.19, correlation: 0.25). These behavioral patterns, considering their correlations, consistently align with lower CES-D scores. Objective sleep data further supports overall well-being with longer-than-average sleep duration and less variability.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards a potentially higher CES-D score is primarily derived from wearable physiological data, particularly the circadian rhythm metrics, though their correlations with CES-D are generally weak. The participant shows lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.73) and intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.45) in heart rate, coupled with a lower amplitude (Z-score: -1.01, correlation: -0.11) and a slightly elevated mesor (Z-score: 0.58, correlation: 0.19). These physiological characteristics suggest a somewhat ""flattened"" or less dynamic cardiovascular rhythm, which can be indicative of physiological stress or dysregulation. The aggregated hourly heart rate also indicated a relatively elevated heart rate during sleep and a blunted response during midday. These physiological patterns, while deviating from population norms in ways that might suggest greater risk, are characterized by weak correlations with CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite some physiological markers suggesting deviations from typical healthy circadian rhythms, the strong and consistent evidence from the self-reported psychological traits and behavioral habits heavily outweighs these. The participant's self-reported low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, low stress, and active lifestyle are powerful indicators, all with moderate to strong correlations, pointing towards a low burden of depressive symptoms. The objective and subjective sleep data also reinforce this positive profile. Therefore, based on the comprehensive multimodal analysis, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is very likely to fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

42137,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"The following analysis integrates self-reported psychological and behavioral data with wearable-derived physiological metrics to interpret the participant's psychological state, behaviors, and potential depressive symptoms.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a pattern of elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 42.0, Z-score 0.07), classifying them as anxious relative to the study population. This trait is strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms (correlation 0.81). Consistent with this, self-reported current happiness is below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). Furthermore, self-esteem is slightly below the population mean (score 37.0, Z-score -0.17), a factor strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), indicating a propensity for higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is notably high (score 25.0, Z-score 0.92), placing the participant significantly above average in stress perception, which weakly correlates with depressive symptoms (0.28). In contrast, the participant reports above-average interpersonal trust (score 3.67, Z-score 0.83) and slightly above-average satisfaction with physical health (score 4.67, Z-score 0.3), both of which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41 and -0.39 respectively), suggesting some resilience factors.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant's subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed according to the PSQI (score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), suggesting difficulties with sleep perception or related issues. However, objective Fitbit data indicates relatively healthy sleep duration, with a median of 7 hours and 18 minutes (Z-score 0.14), which is slightly above the population average. Moreover, consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation 90 minutes, Z-score -0.25) and sleep start time (standard deviation 78 minutes, Z-score -0.1) is better than average, suggesting a regular sleep schedule. These objective sleep consistency factors are weakly correlated with lower CES-D scores.

Physiological metrics derived from wearable data reveal a lower baseline cardiovascular activity, with a Mesor heart rate of 62.62 bpm (Z-score -1.55) and a resting heart rate of 50.3 bpm (Z-score -0.93). Both values are significantly below the study population average, typically indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, and are weakly associated with lower CES-D scores (correlation 0.19). While the overall amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is somewhat reduced (8.56 bpm, Z-score -0.72), indicating less pronounced daily fluctuations, the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations demonstrate clear periods of high physiological arousal. Notably, the participant exhibits significantly elevated heart rates during mid-morning (9-11 am, Z-scores up to 2.14) and late afternoon (4-5 pm, Z-score 2.76), indicating substantial engagement during these hours. Circadian rhythm metrics show slightly above-average interdaily stability (0.45, Z-score 0.33) and intradaily variability (0.63, Z-score 0.60), reflecting consistent patterns and responsiveness in physiological activity throughout the day, with weak or negligible correlations to CES-D.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in solitary exercise frequently (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), positioning them above the population average for this activity, which is weakly correlated with lower CES-D (-0.09). However, participation in social exercise and sports is average or below average. Substance use habits are generally low, with no recreational or non-prescribed drug use and no beer consumption, suggesting a healthy pattern. Regarding daily recreational habits, the participant reports above-average time spent on sedentary hobbies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.41) and watching TV/videos/movies (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.64), both of which are weakly correlated with higher CES-D (0.12 and 0.13 respectively). Conversely, time spent socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62) and listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score -0.72) is below average.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents several strong indicators for elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is classified as ""anxious"" with a Z-score of 0.07, and this variable has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem is slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.17) and shows a robust negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), implying that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is notably high (Z-score 0.92), exceeding nearly all peers, and current happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53), a factor moderately negatively correlated with CES-D. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), a common correlate of depressive symptoms. Behavioral patterns also contribute to this picture, with above-average engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 1.41) and slightly above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.18), both weakly correlating with higher CES-D scores.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest a more favorable position regarding depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41), indicating a potential protective factor. Similarly, health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.30) and also moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). Objectively, sleep patterns show consistency in both duration (Z-score -0.25) and start time (Z-score -0.10), indicating regularity, which is weakly associated with lower CES-D scores. Physiologically, the participant demonstrates a lower overall heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.55, Resting Heart Rate Z-score -0.93), typically indicative of good cardiovascular health and weakly associated with lower CES-D. High engagement in solitary exercise (Z-score 1.07) is another behavior weakly correlated with lower CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When weighing the evidence, the psychological indicators strongly associated with higher CES-D scores (anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, high perceived stress) appear more prominent and have stronger correlations compared to the factors suggesting lower depressive symptomatology. While the participant benefits from above-average trust, good health satisfaction, and consistent objective sleep, the core psychological vulnerabilities are significant. The observed patterns of elevated trait anxiety, diminished self-esteem, reduced happiness, and high perceived stress suggest a substantial burden of symptoms commonly associated with depression. Therefore, despite some protective factors, the cumulative impact of these negative indicators places the participant's overall depressive symptom burden in the higher range of the study population.

48013,19.0,0.7616580310880829,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex interplay of psychological distress and physiological dysregulation, despite engagement in certain health-promoting behaviors. Psychologically, there is strong evidence of elevated internalizing symptoms: the participant reports significantly high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.35), very low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.43), and low current happiness (Z-score -1.61). These metrics are notably correlated with higher depressive symptom burden (STAI r=0.81, Self-Esteem r=-0.71, Happy r=-0.46), indicating a substantial subjective experience of distress. Additionally, perceived stress is above average (PSS Z-score 0.92) and interpersonal trust is markedly low (Z-score -2.07). Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score of 7, exceeding the clinical cut-off of 5), further contributing to a profile consistent with heightened psychological vulnerability.

Physiologically and behaviorally, the wearable data indicates significant disruptions in the participant's circadian rhythm and sleep patterns. While median sleep duration is slightly below average at just under 7 hours (Z-score -0.31), both sleep duration and sleep start times show high variability (Z-scores 1.13 and 0.8 respectively), suggesting irregular sleep habits. These variabilities correlate positively with CES-D scores (r=0.20, r=0.21). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further reveal a lack of regularity, with low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.48) and low 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score -1.54), indicating inconsistent daily patterns in physiological activity. The heart rate amplitude is also low (Z-score -1.08), suggesting a ""flattened"" physiological rhythm, often indicative of reduced vitality or physiological resilience. The Acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:28 PM. An examination of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced physiological activation in the early morning (6-8 AM, Z-scores 3.5 and 2.07) followed by notable dips below the mesor during midday hours (12-2 PM, Z-scores -2.42 and -1.92), suggesting a dysregulated pattern of arousal with initial high stress or activity followed by periods of lower engagement.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant demonstrates a strong commitment to physical activity, exercising alone, with others, and engaging in sports at frequencies well above the study population average (Z-scores 1.07, 1.23, and 0.91 respectively). These behaviors, typically protective against depressive symptoms, may represent active coping strategies or areas of resilience. Academic performance has shown a positive trend, with GPA improving over successive semesters. Substance use is moderate, with alcohol consumption slightly above average but no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Recreational habits include above-average internet and music usage, which show weak positive correlations with CES-D, possibly indicating their role as coping or distraction mechanisms. Socializing with friends is at an average frequency. Overall, the data points to significant psychological and physiological distress, particularly concerning affect, self-concept, and circadian regulation, which appear to coexist with proactive engagement in physical activity and academic achievement.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits a pattern of self-reported psychological traits strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology. Notably, trait anxiety (STAI) is classified as ""anxious"" with a Z-score of 1.35 and a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81). Self-esteem is markedly low (Z-score -1.43) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71). Self-reported happiness is low (Z-score -1.61, r=-0.46), and perceived stress is above average (Z-score 0.92). Low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.07) also correlates negatively with CES-D (r=-0.41). Subjectively, sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI score of 7). Objective sleep data from wearables reinforces this, showing high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 1.13, r=0.20) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.8, r=0.21), patterns known to be associated with poorer mental health. Circadian rhythm metrics further support physiological dysregulation, with low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.48), low 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score -1.54), and a flattened heart rate Amplitude (Z-score -1.08), all commonly observed in individuals with mood disturbances. The hourly heart rate profile, characterized by exceptionally high morning arousal followed by distinct midday dips, suggests a dysregulated physiological response.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
The participant engages in frequent exercise, both alone and with others, which is generally considered a protective factor against depression, despite weak negative correlations with CES-D. Academic performance, as indicated by improving GPA, suggests adaptive functioning in at least one significant life domain. Physical health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score 0.3), and resting heart rate is average (Z-score 0.14). The participant does not report recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and maintains an average frequency of socializing with friends. These factors suggest areas of strength and relative well-being that might mitigate some depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite several protective factors, particularly in exercise and academic performance, the overwhelming weight of evidence points towards a high depressive symptom burden. The strong and consistent indicators of elevated anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, high stress, and significant sleep/circadian rhythm disruptions, many of which have strong and direct correlations with CES-D, suggest that the participant's overall CES-D score would be significantly above the population median. The core psychological symptoms, coupled with objective physiological dysregulation, are highly characteristic of elevated depressive symptomatology, far outweighing the positive indicators. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

14571,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notably positive psychological profile characterized by exceptionally low trait anxiety and perceived stress. Their STAI score of 20.0 (Z-score -2.11) indicates they are not anxious, a dimension strongly and positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Similarly, a Perceived Stress Scale score of 12.0 (Z-score -2.62) reflects very low perceived stress, which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.28), further suggesting lower depressive symptom burden. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES score 46.0, Z-score 1.1) and high current happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), both of which are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71 and r=-0.46, respectively). These self-reported psychological states collectively point towards a low predisposition for depressive symptoms.

Regarding sleep and daily rhythms, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality with a PSQI score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.72). Wearable data corroborates a highly stable and regular physiological circadian rhythm, as evidenced by a high Interdaily Stability (Value 0.7, Z-score 2.4) and low Intradaily Variability (Value 0.22, Z-score -2.29), alongside a strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Value 0.59, Z-score 2.24). These metrics suggest a robust and consistent daily physiological pattern, which is generally associated with better mental health outcomes. Objectively, median sleep duration is average at 7 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score 0.06), with very low variability in sleep duration (35 minutes, Z-score -1.48) and consistent sleep start times (Z-score -0.64). The consistency in sleep, as reflected by low standard deviations, is weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting that more consistent sleep is associated with lower depressive symptoms.

However, the participant's lifestyle also presents aspects that could potentially contribute to higher depressive symptoms, although these are generally outweighed by the strong positive psychological indicators. They report very low interpersonal trust (Score 2.0, Z-score -2.39), which, given its moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.42), implies that their low trust levels would be associated with a higher CES-D score. Furthermore, their physical activity levels are notably low, with ""Not at all"" reported for exercising alone and sports, and ""Less than 1-2 times a month"" for exercising with others, placing them significantly below the population average (e.g., Z-score -1.93 for exercising alone). Conversely, their daily recreation habits are highly sedentary, with substantial time spent on screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, and internet usage (all >4 hours, with high Z-scores ranging from 2.19 to 4.74). These sedentary behaviors show weak positive correlations with CES-D, indicating a potential modest association with increased depressive symptoms. Physiologically, the participant's average heart rate (Mesor 83.84 bpm, Z-score 1.35) and resting heart rate (62.4 bpm, Z-score 0.51) are slightly above the population average, each exhibiting a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.2). The aggregated hourly heart rate data show a clear and robust diurnal pattern with significant physiological quiescence during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -26.09 bpm from mesor at 5-6 AM) and sustained elevations during daytime activity, peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 14.84 bpm from mesor at 7-8 PM). This overall robust circadian rhythm, despite the slightly elevated baseline heart rates, does not indicate a general pattern of physiological dysregulation commonly associated with depression.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

The participant demonstrates a strong cluster of self-reported psychological indicators that are significantly associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Their STAI score (Z-score -2.11, ""not anxious"") is remarkably low, and its strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81) implies a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms. Similarly, their high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1) and high reported happiness (Z-score 1.64) are both strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71 and r=-0.46, respectively), suggesting further protection against depressive symptoms. The participant also reports exceptionally low perceived stress (Z-score -2.62) and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.72), both of which are generally indicative of lower CES-D scores. From wearable data, a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability, high 24-hour autocorrelation, all with extreme Z-scores) and consistent sleep patterns (low standard deviation for sleep duration and start time, with weak positive correlations to CES-D) are observed. These objective measures of physiological and behavioral regularity are often associated with better mental health and lower depressive symptom burden.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Several factors suggest a potential for higher depressive symptoms. The participant's very low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.39) is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.42), meaning lower trust is associated with higher depressive symptoms in the study population. Additionally, their self-reported health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.45), which, with its moderate negative correlation (r=-0.4), points towards a higher CES-D score. Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a highly sedentary lifestyle, engaging minimally in physical exercise (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93) and spending extensive periods on screen-based recreational activities (e.g., Video Games Z-score 4.74, Watching TV Z-score 3.17, Internet Usage Z-score 2.19). While some of these activities have only weak positive correlations with CES-D (e.g., r=0.09 for Video Games, r=0.14 for TV), a sedentary lifestyle is generally considered a risk factor for depression. Physiologically, the participant's Mesor heart rate (Z-score 1.35) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 0.51) are slightly elevated, both having a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.2), indicating a minor association with higher depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The cumulative evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The positive psychological indicators are exceptionally strong, with very low trait anxiety and perceived stress, high self-esteem, and high happiness, all exhibiting substantial Z-scores and robust correlations with CES-D. These factors individually and collectively exert a powerful influence towards lower depressive symptoms. While there are some counter-indicators such as low trust, slightly lower health satisfaction, and a highly sedentary lifestyle with slightly elevated resting heart rates, the correlations associated with these factors are generally weaker or less numerous than those supporting a lower CES-D score. The participant's objective sleep metrics and highly stable circadian rhythms also align with better overall well-being. Therefore, the magnitude and strength of the evidence pointing to psychological well-being outweigh the more modest indicators of potential risk for depressive symptoms.

69057,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex profile characterized by significant self-reported psychological distress, marked sleep deprivation, and some indicators of circadian rhythm disruption, juxtaposed with exceptional cardiovascular fitness. Self-report data indicates a notably high level of chronic anxiety (STAI score of 53.0, Z-score of 1.16), classifying the individual as anxious, and a similarly elevated level of perceived stress (PSS score of 26.0, Z-score of 1.19). These are accompanied by below-average self-esteem (Z-score of -0.45), happiness (Z-score of -0.53), and health satisfaction (Z-score of -0.78), along with a significantly low degree of interpersonal trust (Z-score of -1.42). Academically, a consistent decline in GPA across semesters suggests potential academic challenges or disengagement. Recreational drug use is reported at a higher frequency than the population average (Z-score of 1.61), which may be a coping mechanism or a factor influencing overall well-being.

Sleep metrics provide a particularly salient insight into the participant's behavioral patterns. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 indicates clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, which is strongly supported by objective wearable data. The participant exhibits an extremely short median sleep duration of 5 hours 35 minutes (Z-score of -1.99), coupled with a consistently very late median sleep start time of 02:08:15. This late and insufficient sleep pattern is further corroborated by aggregated hourly heart rate data, which shows a significant elevation in heart rate deviation from the mesor between 12-1 AM (Z-score of 1.31), suggesting elevated physiological activity during a typical resting period. While the participant engages in above-average physical activity, particularly exercising alone (Z-score of 1.07), and maintains average social interaction, these healthy behaviors do not appear to mitigate the pronounced sleep deficits and psychological strain.

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals a somewhat dampened and less stable physiological rhythm. The interdaily stability (Z-score of -0.74) is below average, indicating less consistency in day-to-day heart rate patterns, and the amplitude (Z-score of -0.68) is also below average, suggesting a less robust daily fluctuation between peak and trough heart rate. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z-score of 0.39), potentially reflecting more fragmented activity within the day. Paradoxically, the participant demonstrates exceptionally high cardiovascular fitness, as evidenced by a very low overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score of -2.19) and an extremely low resting heart rate (Z-score of -1.73). Despite this impressive physical conditioning, the collective evidence from self-report and sleep data points towards a state of considerable psychological distress and behavioral dysregulation, particularly concerning sleep.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence from the self-reported surveys strongly suggests that the participant's depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution. The participant reports significantly elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.16) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score 1.19), both of which are positively correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.82 and 0.28, respectively). Furthermore, the participant exhibits below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.45), happiness (Z-score -0.53), interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.42), and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78), with all these metrics showing moderate to strong negative correlations with CES-D, indicating an association with higher depressive symptomatology. The objective and subjective sleep data further support this, with the participant experiencing clinically significant disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0) and critically short median sleep duration (5 hours 35 minutes, Z-score -1.99), conditions widely recognized as symptoms and risk factors for depression. The observed decline in GPA and higher recreational drug use also align with a profile of increased psychological distress.

Conversely, there is evidence that might suggest a lower CES-D score. The participant demonstrates remarkable cardiovascular fitness, with an exceptionally low mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -2.19) and resting heart rate (Z-score -1.73). The positive correlation of these metrics with CES-D suggests that lower values (like those observed for this participant) are associated with lower depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant engages in above-average levels of exercise, which typically acts as a protective factor against depression, with observed negative correlations between exercise frequency and CES-D. The consistently low variability in sleep start time might also be a minor protective factor, despite the consistently late timing.

However, a holistic analysis of all available evidence indicates that the profound and pervasive indicators of psychological distress and severe sleep deprivation outweigh the protective factors related to physical fitness. While the participant is physically fit, the high levels of anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, and critically insufficient sleep are direct and strong correlates of elevated depressive symptoms. The consistent pattern of maladaptive sleep behavior, coupled with negative emotional and cognitive states, strongly aligns with a higher burden of depressive symptomatology. Therefore, despite the notable physical fitness, the participant's overall profile points towards a CES-D score in the top half of the distribution.

64232,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a pattern of psychological and behavioral characteristics indicative of elevated distress and potential challenges in emotional regulation. Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score of 44.0, Z-score 0.27) is above the population mean, classified as anxious, and shows a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem (RSES score of 37.0, Z-score -0.17) is slightly below average and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71). Perceived stress levels are notably high (PSS score of 27.0, Z-score 1.47), significantly exceeding the population mean, although its correlation with CES-D is weaker (0.28). Self-reported happiness (score of 3.0, Z-score -0.53) is below average and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting a lower baseline mood. Health satisfaction, while near the population average (Z-score -0.03), also exhibits a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39). These self-reported psychological states collectively point towards an increased burden of negative affect and a reduced sense of well-being.

Sleep patterns reveal significant disturbances, despite an adequate median sleep duration. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) indicates subjectively poor sleep quality, consistent with a ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification. While the participant's median sleep duration of 8 hours 0 minutes is significantly above average (Z-score 1.01), there is substantial variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 136 minutes, Z-score 0.79) and, more strikingly, in sleep start times (standard deviation of 150 minutes, Z-score 1.48). This high variability suggests an irregular sleep schedule, which is further corroborated by a significantly low interdaily stability of heart rate-based circadian rhythms (value 0.22, Z-score -1.56). This reduced interdaily stability indicates a lack of consistent daily patterns, which can disrupt physiological regulation and contribute to mood disturbances. The acrophase, or peak in heart rate activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:57 PM, potentially reflecting a delayed activity rhythm.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal throughout the day. While overall heart rate (Mesor 77.33, Z-score 0.46) is slightly above average, and resting heart rate is within typical bounds (Z-score 0.15), there are notable fluctuations in daily activity. Specifically, there are significant dips in heart rate deviation from the mesor during the mid-afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM, Z-score -1.08; 3-4 PM, Z-score -1.36), indicating periods of lower physiological arousal or activity compared to the population average at these times. This pattern, alongside an amplitude of heart rate variability that is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17), suggests less robust or consistent physiological engagement across the day. In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant engages in frequent sports activity (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.58), which is a positive health behavior. However, there is also significantly elevated recreational drug usage (1-2 times a month, Z-score 3.52), which, despite a weak positive correlation with CES-D, can be a behavioral indicator of coping mechanisms for underlying psychological distress. The participant engages minimally in passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies or reading, with internet usage and socializing with friends being around average.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To determine if the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden places them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores, we consider the cumulative evidence. The population's 50th percentile CES-D score is 11.0.

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50%):
*   **Elevated Anxiety (STAI):** The participant's STAI score is above average and strongly positively correlated with CES-D (0.81), indicating that higher anxiety in this individual is strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Reduced Self-Esteem:** A slightly below-average self-esteem score, coupled with a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), suggests that lower self-esteem aligns with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Significantly High Perceived Stress (PSS):** The participant reports substantially higher stress levels (Z-score 1.47), a factor commonly associated with increased depressive symptomatology.
*   **Lower Self-Reported Happiness:** Below-average happiness, with a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), indicates a general lower mood state that is often co-occurs with depression.
*   **Disturbed Sleep Quality (PSQI):** A PSQI score of 8.0 signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance, a prominent symptom of depression.
*   **Irregular Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Schedule:** The significantly low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.56) and highly variable sleep start times (Z-score 1.48) point to severely disrupted sleep-wake cycles, which are known to exacerbate and be symptoms of mood disorders.
*   **Afternoon Physiological Dips:** The notable mid-afternoon reductions in heart rate deviation from the mesor (negative Z-scores) suggest periods of reduced physiological activity or arousal that are more pronounced than average, which could align with symptoms of fatigue or anhedonia.
*   **High Recreational Drug Use:** While weakly correlated, significantly elevated recreational drug use (Z-score 3.52) can be a maladaptive coping mechanism associated with underlying psychological distress, including depressive symptoms.

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):
*   **Above-Average Median Sleep Duration:** The participant averages 8 hours of sleep (Z-score 1.01). While high variability negates some of this benefit, the duration itself is generally considered healthy. However, its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.0).
*   **High Sports Participation:** The participant engages in sports frequently (Z-score 1.58), which is a protective factor for mental health. However, its correlation with CES-D is weak (-0.15).

Holistic Analysis:
The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that this participant is experiencing a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The confluence of above-average anxiety and perceived stress, below-average self-esteem and happiness, and particularly the profound sleep disturbances and highly irregular daily rhythms, are all robust indicators associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. While the participant is physically active and reports a long median sleep duration, the severe irregularity in sleep patterns and the presence of significant psychological distress, as reflected in the STAI, PSS, Self-Esteem, and Happiness scores, override these potentially protective factors. The physiological dips observed in the afternoon heart rate also align with potential mood-related energy fluctuations. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
37404,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological metrics. Self-report measures indicate a relatively low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62) and slightly below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.17). Self-esteem is average (RSES Z-score: -0.03), and health satisfaction is also within the average range (Z-score: 0.13). However, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score: -0.53), and trust is also below the population mean (Z-score: -0.46). Academically, the participant maintains a consistently high GPA, suggesting a degree of functional performance. Behavioral habits indicate frequent solitary exercise (Z-score: 1.07), but significantly low engagement in organized sports (Z-score: -1.09) and generally low engagement in various daily recreational activities such as watching TV, video games, reading, and socializing. Substance usage patterns show above-average consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score: 0.94). This combination suggests a potentially limited range of leisure pursuits despite consistent physical activity.

Sleep patterns reveal a discrepancy between subjective and objective measures. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score: 7.0, classified as 'Disturbed Sleep'), despite wearable data indicating an average median sleep duration (7 hours 9 minutes, Z-score: -0.04) and below-average variability in both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.78) and sleep start times (Z-score: -0.39). This suggests that while sleep quantity and consistency in timing are maintained, the subjective experience of sleep quality is poor. The absence of reported daily naps (Z-score: -0.86) is consistent with generally stable sleep timing.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveal significant disturbances in circadian rhythmicity. The participant exhibits very low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.54), alongside very high intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.37). These metrics collectively point to an irregular, fragmented, and poorly synchronized heart rate-based circadian rhythm across days, lacking a consistent day-to-day pattern and exhibiting substantial within-day fluctuations. Furthermore, the circadian amplitude is notably low (Z-score: -1.54), indicating a blunted difference between peak and trough heart rate, suggesting a reduced physiological response range throughout the day. The mesor (mean heart rate) is average (Z-score: -0.12), and resting heart rate is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.32). The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:32 PM. Analysis of the mean aggregate deviation from the mesor indicates a significant dip in heart rate during early morning hours (2-6 AM), consistent with a period of rest, followed by increasing activity into the morning and early evening, with a noticeable decline in activity levels during the mid-afternoon (1-4 PM). However, the overall blunted amplitude and high intradaily variability suggest that even within these general patterns, the physiological state lacks the robust and regular daily rhythm observed in the general population.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.62) is below average, and trait anxiety is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81). Similarly, perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.17) is slightly below average, with a positive correlation to CES-D (0.28). Objective sleep data from the wearable indicates less variability in both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.78) and sleep start times (Z-score: -0.39), and both metrics have positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting that lower variability is associated with lower depressive symptoms. High frequency of exercising alone (Z-score: 1.07) is also typically associated with better mental health outcomes, though its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is weakly negative (-0.09). The consistently high GPA suggests academic functioning is maintained.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Several significant indicators point towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI score: 7.0), and PSQI scores have a strong positive correlation with CES-D (the interpretation notes scores above 5 indicate significant sleep disturbance). Self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score: -0.53), and happiness is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting that lower happiness corresponds to higher CES-D. Crucially, wearable activity metrics show severe disruptions in circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.56) is very low, and while its direct correlation with CES-D is near zero (-0.01), such an extreme deviation often indicates physiological dysregulation associated with mood disorders. Similarly, intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.37) is very high, suggesting fragmented activity patterns, and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score: -1.54) and circadian amplitude (Z-score: -1.54) are both markedly low, indicating a blunted and less robust daily physiological rhythm. Although correlations for these specific wearable metrics with CES-D are generally weak in this dataset, the magnitude of these physiological disruptions (extreme Z-scores) is a substantial indicator of potential underlying distress or dysregulation. Additionally, below-average trust (Z-score: -0.46) is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41), implying that lower trust is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The participant's self-reported low engagement in various recreational activities might also suggest reduced interest or energy, which could be indicative of depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant reports low anxiety and stress, and demonstrates consistent sleep timing and duration, the combination of subjective disturbed sleep quality (PSQI), below-average happiness, and severe physiological dysregulation in circadian rhythms (indicated by extremely low interdaily stability, autocorrelation, amplitude, and very high intradaily variability) strongly suggests an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The physiological disruptions are particularly striking in their extremity, and these patterns are frequently observed in individuals experiencing mood disturbances, even when self-reported emotional states like anxiety and stress might appear normative. Given the clear evidence of disturbed sleep and significant physiological dysregulation, which are core features of depressive disorders, it is likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, places them in the top half of the study population distribution (i.e., above the 50th percentile of 11.5).

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
70492,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"The participant's psychological profile suggests an elevated internal emotional burden, marked by above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.76) and significantly higher perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 0.92). Both of these self-reported measures exhibit positive correlations with CES-D scores, indicating their association with increased depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score: -0.59) and reduced satisfaction with physical health (Health Satisfaction Z-score: -0.62), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D. Interestingly, despite these indicators of distress, the participant also reports higher-than-average current happiness (Happy Z-score: 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D. Interpersonal trust is slightly below the population mean (Trust Z-score: -0.14) and negatively associated with CES-D.

Objective and subjective sleep data highlight significant disturbances. While the participant's subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score of 6.0), their PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates their score is slightly better than the population average. However, objective Fitbit data reveals profound irregularities: the participant exhibits extremely high variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 222 minutes, Z-score: 2.75) and substantially high variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 138 minutes, Z-score: 1.21). Both of these sleep variability metrics are positively correlated with CES-D scores, strongly linking unstable sleep patterns to depressive symptoms. The median sleep start time is notably late at 03:03:40 AM, indicating a significantly delayed and inconsistent sleep schedule, while median sleep duration is slightly below average at 7 hours 5 minutes (Z-score: -0.13).

Behaviorally, the participant's habits include higher-than-average beer consumption (Z-score: 1.01) and an exceptionally elevated usage of non-prescribed drugs (Z-score: 6.84), though reported frequency is low. Engagement in physical activity is consistently below the population mean across all categories, including exercising alone (Z-score: -1.18), exercising with others (Z-score: -0.17), and sports participation (Z-score: -1.09). In terms of daily recreation, the participant reports higher-than-average time spent on internet usage (Z-score: 0.85), listening to music (Z-score: 0.67), and socializing with friends (Z-score: 0.95). Notably, engagement in sedentary hobbies is significantly elevated (Z-score: 1.41), with moderate correlations for internet usage and sedentary hobbies with CES-D.

Physiological data derived from heart rate indicates overall average interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.17) and intraday variability (Z-score: -0.04) of their circadian rhythm. However, both the mesor (mean heart rate, Z-score: -0.60) and amplitude (range of heart rate variation, Z-score: -0.44) are below the population average, suggesting a somewhat blunted physiological response. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs relatively late at 5:12 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal deeper physiological troughs during the early morning hours (e.g., 3-5 AM Z-scores consistently above 1.0) compared to the study population. Conversely, there is a more pronounced elevation in heart rate above the mesor during midday and early afternoon (e.g., 12-3 PM Z-scores around 0.9), suggesting concentrated periods of physiological arousal. This pattern may indicate a compressed or intensified daily activity window, characterized by deep early morning lows and an earlier decline in heart rate activity in the evening relative to the participant's peak.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits several prominent indicators associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Self-report measures show significantly higher trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.76, Correlation=0.81) and perceived stress (PSS Z=0.92, Correlation=0.28), alongside lower self-esteem (RSES Z=-0.59, Correlation=-0.71) and health satisfaction (Health Satisfaction Z=-0.62, Correlation=-0.39). Objectively, the most compelling evidence lies in the extreme variability of sleep patterns, with exceptionally high Z-scores for both sleep duration standard deviation (Z=2.75) and sleep start time standard deviation (Z=1.21), both strongly positively correlated with CES-D. These indicate severe sleep dysregulation. Behaviorally, the participant's significantly elevated usage of non-prescribed drugs (Z=6.84) and general reduction in exercise, alongside increased engagement in sedentary online activities (Internet Usage Z=0.85, Sedentary Hobby Z=1.41 with positive CES-D correlations), are also consistent with patterns observed in elevated depressive symptomatology. Physiologically, the blunted heart rate amplitude and lower mesor suggest reduced physiological responsiveness.

**Evidence for Low/Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
Counterbalancing these findings, the participant reports above-average happiness (Happy Z=0.55), which is negatively correlated with CES-D. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, while indicative of ""Disturbed Sleep"" at an absolute score of 6.0, shows a Z-score of -0.33, implying it is better than the average subjective sleep quality within the study population. Additionally, daily naps are absent (Z-score: -0.86). The participant also reports higher-than-average socializing with friends (Z=0.95), though this has a negligible correlation with CES-D. The heart rate-derived interdaily stability and intraday variability metrics are close to the population average, suggesting some underlying regularity in the circadian rhythm despite the extreme sleep timing and duration variability.

Despite the self-reported higher happiness and slightly better subjective PSQI score relative to the population, the overwhelming and most salient evidence points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The extremely high variability in objective sleep metrics (duration and start time) paired with their strong positive correlations with CES-D are particularly impactful. These, combined with significantly elevated trait anxiety, perceived stress, and notably low self-esteem, present a coherent picture of substantial distress and dysregulation. The blunted physiological responses and behavioral shifts towards reduced exercise and increased sedentary activity further support this interpretation. The high non-prescribed drug use, even if weakly correlated, suggests potential coping mechanisms. Therefore, the cumulative weight of the evidence indicates that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely higher than the median of the study population.

The participant demonstrates a robust profile of psychological well-being, characterized by notably low trait anxiety and high self-esteem. Their STAI-Trait score (Z-score -1.81) indicates anxiety levels significantly below the population mean, a factor strongly and positively correlated with depressive symptoms (0.81). Concurrently, their Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (Z-score 1.52) reflects considerably elevated self-esteem, which is robustly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71). Further supporting this pattern are self-reported happiness levels (Z-score 1.64), indicating above-average contentment, and perceived stress (Z-score -0.98), suggesting a lower-than-average stress burden, both of which are favorably correlated with depressive symptomatology. Additionally, their satisfaction with physical health is high (Z-score 1.3), bearing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39). These self-reported psychological indicators collectively suggest a strong emotional and cognitive resilience, generally protective against depressive symptoms.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant exhibits a conservative approach to substance use, reporting no engagement with alcohol or recreational drugs, with associated Z-scores significantly below the population average. Exercise habits indicate a strong preference for social physical activity, exercising with others three times a week or more (Z-score 1.23), a behavior moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23). Conversely, solitary exercise is reported as ""not at all"" (Z-score -1.93). Recreational activities show some variation; the participant engages in above-average time watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and playing video games (Z-score 1.71), although these activities show only weak positive correlations with CES-D. Socializing with friends falls within the average range (Z-score 0.16). While some screen-based recreational habits are above average, their minimal correlation with CES-D suggests these do not significantly contribute to depressive symptom burden in this context, especially when balanced by positive social engagement in exercise.

Sleep patterns are consistently positive, both subjectively and objectively. The participant’s Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 3.0 (Z-score -1.72) indicates good subjective sleep quality, notably below the clinical cutoff for sleep disturbance and significantly better than the study population average. Wearable data corroborates this with objective consistency: the standard deviation for sleep duration (Z-score -0.92) and sleep start time (Z-score -1.08) are both below the population average, demonstrating highly regular sleep-wake cycles. The median sleep duration of 7 hours and 25 minutes falls within a healthy range (Z-score 0.29), and the absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) suggests consolidated nighttime sleep. Although the median sleep start time is relatively late at 02:25:30, the strong consistency and good subjective quality override this to indicate generally healthy sleep architecture.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveal a highly regular and robust circadian rhythm. Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.08) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.57) are both significantly above average, pointing to highly predictable and consistent daily patterns in heart rate activity. The circadian amplitude (Z-score 0.78) is strong, indicating a clear physiological differentiation between active and resting periods. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs in the early evening (6:35 PM), which aligns with typical diurnal patterns, followed by a gradual decline into the early morning hours, where heart rate deviations from the mesor are lowest (e.g., -20.5 at 6-7 AM). While the participant's overall Mesor (Z-score 1.22) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 1.02) are slightly above the population average, their correlations with CES-D are weak (0.2), suggesting these elevated baseline heart rate parameters do not strongly contribute to depressive symptom severity in this case. The hourly heart rate deviations demonstrate a clear and well-defined physiological rhythm throughout the day, reinforcing the impression of stable biological regulation.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological state offers compelling evidence for a low or median CES-D score. Their trait anxiety is remarkably low (STAI Z-score -1.81), and this measure has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, indicating that low anxiety levels are predictive of lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, their self-esteem is exceptionally high (RSES Z-score 1.52), which is strongly negatively correlated (-0.71) with CES-D. Elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64) and reduced perceived stress (Z-score -0.98), along with high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.3), all contribute substantially to a profile indicative of lower depressive symptomatology due to their favorable correlations with CES-D.

Objective and subjective sleep measures further reinforce this. The participant reports excellent subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 3.0, Z-score -1.72), which is inversely related to depressive symptoms. Objectively, their sleep duration and start time exhibit low variability (SD Z-scores -0.92 and -1.08, respectively), signifying consistent and stable sleep patterns, generally associated with better mental health. Behavioral data shows a high frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 1.23), a habit moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23), suggesting a protective social and physical activity engagement. Furthermore, the absence of substance use and consistently high academic performance (GPA) are generally associated with better overall functioning and lower psychological distress.

Physiologically, the participant displays a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm, evidenced by significantly above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.08) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.57). Strong circadian rhythmicity is typically indicative of healthy biological regulation and is often disrupted in depression, suggesting its presence here points away from elevated depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a high CES-D score is comparatively weak. The participant's Mesor (Z-score 1.22) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 1.02) are slightly above the population average. Both metrics show a weak positive correlation (0.2) with CES-D, suggesting a minor and potentially negligible association with elevated depressive symptoms in this context. Some recreational behaviors, such as above-average screen time for watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and video games (Z-score 1.71), have weak positive correlations with CES-D. A below-average engagement in listening to music (Z-score -1.19) also has a weak positive correlation (0.25). However, these correlations are of minor magnitude and are unlikely to outweigh the strong indicators of psychological well-being and adaptive functioning observed across other domains.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that the participant experiences a low burden of depressive symptoms. Key self-reported measures of anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, and stress consistently fall within a healthy range, often significantly better than the study population average, and are strongly associated with lower CES-D scores. Excellent subjective and objective sleep quality and consistency further support this conclusion. While some physiological parameters (e.g., Resting Heart Rate, Mesor) are slightly elevated, and certain recreational activities show minor positive correlations with CES-D, these effects are weak and are overwhelmingly overshadowed by the robust indicators of psychological resilience, adaptive lifestyle choices, and highly stable biological rhythms. Therefore, the participant’s overall profile strongly aligns with individuals experiencing low or average depressive symptomatology within the study population.

67106,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"The participant generally presents a favorable psychological profile, characterized by lower-than-average anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with elevated self-esteem, happiness, trust, and satisfaction with physical health. Specifically, their STAI-Trait score (Z-score -1.22) indicates significantly lower anxiety proneness than the study population, which is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms (correlation 0.81). Consistent with this, the participant exhibits notably higher self-esteem (Z-score 1.1) and self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64), both of which inversely correlate with CES-D scores (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively). Furthermore, their low perceived stress (Z-score -0.98) and high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.47) align with a reduced likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology, based on their respective correlations with CES-D (0.28 and -0.39). The participant also demonstrates high academic achievement, maintaining a strong GPA across multiple academic semesters.

Behaviorally, the participant reports no substance use across all surveyed categories, indicating a healthy stance on these habits. However, their physical activity levels are notably low, with minimal engagement in exercise alone, and no participation in exercising with others or sports, all registering significantly negative Z-scores. While reduced exercise typically correlates with higher CES-D scores (e.g., -0.24 for exercising with others), the participant's overall positive psychological state may mitigate the impact of this factor. Social engagement is also markedly low, with reported socializing with friends occurring ""15 minutes or less"" per day (Z-score -2.2). Despite this, the correlation between socializing and CES-D is negligible (-0.02). Similarly, engagement in other recreational activities, such as internet usage (Z-score -1.83) and watching TV/videos/movies, is minimal.

Sleep patterns present a mixed interpretation. The participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 formally classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed."" However, their PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their subjective sleep quality is slightly *better* than the average for the study population. Fitbit-derived data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours 46 minutes (Z-score -0.51), which is below average and the generally recommended 7-9 hours, although its correlation with CES-D is negligible. The participant also exhibits a late median sleep start time of 01:28:59 and engages in slightly above-average napping (Z-score 0.61), which shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D.

Physiological data from wearable devices highlights a highly stable and robust circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits very high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.9) and strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 2.07), alongside below-average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.53). These metrics collectively point to consistent, regular daily patterns in heart rate activity and rest, indicating a well-entrained and less fragmented physiological rhythm. The heart rate mesor (72.42 bpm) and resting heart rate (56.3 bpm) are both slightly below the population average (Z-scores -0.21 and -0.22, respectively), suggesting good cardiovascular health. Hourly deviations from the mesor further illustrate a pronounced diurnal rhythm, with heart rates significantly lower during sleep and appropriately elevated during waking hours, peaking in the late morning and early evening, indicating a robust amplitude (Z-score 0.59).

Considering the entirety of the multimodal data, the participant’s profile strongly suggests a lower burden of depressive symptoms. The overwhelming majority of self-reported psychological measures, including very low anxiety and stress, high self-esteem, happiness, trust, and health satisfaction, are indicative of positive mental well-being and consistently correlate with lower CES-D scores. Furthermore, the objective physiological data reveals a highly stable and robust circadian rhythm and good cardiovascular fitness, factors generally associated with better mental health outcomes. While the participant exhibits low engagement in exercise and social activities, and has a self-reported ""disturbed"" sleep classification, these indicators are tempered by the participant's relative sleep quality (better than the study population average) and the largely negligible or weak correlations of these specific behaviors with CES-D scores in the broader study population. The robust positive psychological and physiological markers likely outweigh the noted behavioral deficits in determining the overall depressive symptom burden for this individual. Therefore, it is probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

83612,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant internal psychological distress alongside objective physiological dysregulation, despite some areas of apparent behavioral and subjective well-being. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a pronounced tendency towards anxiety and low self-worth, with the STAI-Trait score of 58.0 placing the participant at 1.65 standard deviations above the population mean, classifying them as anxious. This high anxiety is strongly correlated with elevated depressive symptoms (r=0.82). Concurrently, self-esteem, as measured by the RSES, is low (score 29.0, Z-score -1.29), showing a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (r=-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is highly associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Further contributing to this pattern, the participant reported below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1), which is moderately correlated with higher CES-D scores (r=-0.41). These findings collectively suggest a substantial psychological vulnerability to depressive symptoms. Notably, self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), and perceived stress is only marginally elevated (Z-score 0.38), presenting a nuanced picture where a degree of positive affect or perceived manageability of stress coexists with underlying anxiety and low self-esteem. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, indicating effective functioning in this domain.

Analysis of sleep patterns and circadian rhythmicity reveals objective signs of physiological disruption. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5.0 is exactly at the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance, the participant's Z-score of -0.8 suggests subjectively better sleep quality than the population average. Fitbit data corroborates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 42 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.59), but with a commendably consistent sleep duration (standard deviation of 67 minutes, Z-score -0.76). However, the regularity of sleep timing is average (sleep start time standard deviation Z-score 0.02), with a relatively late median sleep start time of 00:51:15. More critically, the participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythms exhibit marked dysregulation. Interdaily stability is notably low (0.28, Z-score -1.07) and intradaily variability is high (0.7, Z-score 1.09), indicating fragmented and less predictable day-to-day physiological patterns. The low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.17, Z-score -1.29) further confirms poor rhythmic regularity. Additionally, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly reduced (Z-score -0.48), suggesting less pronounced physiological differentiation between active and rest phases.

Further examining daily physiological activity and behavioral habits, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a pattern of elevated arousal during evening hours. Specifically, heart rate deviations from the mesor show significant elevations between 9-10 PM (+15.67 bpm, Z-score 1.33), suggesting sustained physiological activation late into the evening. This pattern of heightened evening arousal may interfere with the initiation of restful sleep and indicates a general state of increased physiological burden. In terms of daily activities, the participant's substance usage is generally low or moderate, and exercise frequency (exercising alone or with others 1-2 times a week) is slightly above average, which could be considered protective factors. However, self-reported daily recreation habits indicate less time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62) and listening to music (Z-score -0.72) compared to peers, alongside above-average engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 0.82). Reduced social engagement is often associated with greater feelings of isolation and depressive symptoms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. The STAI-Trait score is highly elevated (Z-score 1.65, classified as anxious), and this measure shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.82). Similarly, self-esteem is significantly low (Z-score -1.29), with a substantial negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is highly predictive of higher depressive symptoms. Low interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1) also moderately correlates with higher CES-D (r=-0.41). Objectively, the wearable data consistently points to significant circadian rhythm dysregulation, including low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.07), high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.09), and low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.29), all of which are commonly observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. The reduced amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Z-score -0.48) further supports this. The notable elevation in mean heart rate during late evening hours (9-10 PM, Z-score 1.33) indicates sustained physiological arousal, which can contribute to sleep difficulties and heightened distress. Furthermore, the participant reports spending less time socializing with friends compared to peers (Z-score -0.62), a behavioral pattern often associated with social withdrawal in depression.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Countervailing evidence includes the participant's self-reported happiness being slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D (r=-0.46), suggesting a lower depressive symptom burden. Although the PSQI score of 5.0 is at the clinical cutoff, the associated Z-score of -0.8 indicates subjectively better sleep quality than the average study participant. The participant also demonstrates relatively consistent sleep duration (low sleep duration standard deviation Z-score -0.76). Consistently high academic performance (GPA) suggests effective functioning in a key life domain. The participant's perceived stress (Z-score 0.38) is only slightly elevated, and while positively correlated with CES-D (r=0.28), the correlation is modest. Their resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.42), implying good cardiovascular fitness.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite some indicators suggesting average or better well-being (happiness, PSQI Z-score, consistent sleep duration, high GPA), the convergence of extremely strong psychological distress markers (high trait anxiety, low self-esteem) with objective evidence of significant physiological dysregulation (circadian disruption, sustained evening arousal) presents a compelling picture of elevated depressive symptom burden. The very high correlation coefficients between STAI and Self-Esteem scores with CES-D strongly suggest that these factors would disproportionately influence the overall CES-D score towards the higher end. The physiological dysregulation, while not having strong direct correlations with CES-D in *this specific dataset*, is widely recognized in clinical literature as being associated with depressive states. Therefore, the weight of evidence, particularly from the highly correlated psychological self-report measures and the objective physiological disruptions, points towards an elevated level of depressive symptoms.

The participant exhibits a strong profile of psychological well-being and adaptive lifestyle choices. Self-report measures indicate remarkably low trait anxiety (STAI score 24.0, Z-score -1.71, classified as ""not anxious""), which is strongly negatively associated with depressive symptoms (correlation 0.81 for higher anxiety, thus lower anxiety for lower CES-D). Self-esteem is notably high (score 48.0, Z-score 1.38) and is inversely correlated with depressive symptoms (correlation -0.71). Subjective happiness is also significantly elevated (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), a factor negatively correlated with CES-D (correlation -0.46). Furthermore, perceived stress is low (PSS score 18.0, Z-score -0.98), correlating positively with CES-D (correlation 0.28, thus low stress for low CES-D), and satisfaction with physical health is high (score 5.89, Z-score 1.22), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (correlation -0.39). These psychological metrics consistently suggest a reduced burden of depressive symptomatology. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA. In terms of daily habits, there is frequent engagement in exercise alone (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) and active socialization (2-3 hours daily, Z-score 0.95), alongside substantial reading (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score 1.3). Engagement in passive recreational activities like TV/videos, video games, and internet usage is low. The participant’s alcohol consumption (wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.94) is slightly above average, while recreational drug use is reported as ""not at all."" A minor counterpoint is slightly below average interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46), which is mildly associated with higher CES-D (correlation -0.41).

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" However, relative to the study population, the Z-score of -0.33 indicates subjective sleep quality is slightly better than average. Objectively, wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 17 minutes, which is notably low (Z-score -1.11), although its correlation with CES-D is negligible (correlation -0.01). Both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit slightly higher variability than the population average (standard deviations of 120 minutes and 113 minutes, with Z-scores of 0.43 and 0.66 respectively). Higher variability in these metrics is weakly associated with increased CES-D scores (correlations 0.2 and 0.22). Mean daily napping frequency is close to the population average (Z-score -0.08).

Cardiovascular activity and circadian rhythms demonstrate robust physiological patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is notably low at 49.05 bpm (Z-score -1.08), which is associated with lower CES-D scores (correlation 0.19 for higher RHR). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate are generally favorable: Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability are near population averages (Z-scores -0.08 and -0.18), indicating a well-structured daily rhythm. A slightly above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.56) further supports rhythmicity. The Mesor, or mean heart rate, is slightly below average (Z-score -0.35), which is associated with lower CES-D (correlation 0.19 for higher mesor). The acrophase, or peak activity time, is observed at 4:17 PM. Aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear and pronounced daily physiological cycle. Deviations are significantly negative during typical sleep hours (e.g., -27.48 bpm between 3-4 AM, Z-score -1.77), indicative of deep physiological rest. The positive correlation of this deviation with CES-D (0.15 for higher deviation, i.e., less negative) suggests this profound dip is consistent with lower depressive symptoms. Conversely, heart rate deviations are distinctly positive during waking and active hours, peaking at 20.31 bpm above the mesor between 6-7 PM (Z-score 1.35), reflecting significant physiological engagement during the evening. This peak activity has a weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.1), aligning with potentially lower depressive symptoms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant presents a compelling case for a low or median CES-D score. Self-reported psychological measures are overwhelmingly positive: significantly low trait anxiety (Z-score -1.71), high self-esteem (Z-score 1.38), very high happiness (Z-score 1.64), low perceived stress (Z-score -0.98), and high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22). All these factors are either strongly negatively correlated with CES-D or, in the case of stress and anxiety, indicate a state that is strongly associated with lower CES-D. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a notably low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.08) and a slightly lower heart rate mesor (Z-score -0.35), both of which are associated with lower CES-D. The pronounced and well-structured hourly heart rate rhythm, particularly the significant drops during sleep and the robust peaks during activity, further suggest healthy physiological regulation consistent with lower depressive symptoms. The participant's subjective sleep quality, as indicated by a PSQI Z-score of -0.33, is better than the population average, despite the classification of ""disturbed sleep"" by threshold.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a high CES-D score is considerably weaker. Objectively measured median sleep duration is low (6 hours 17 minutes, Z-score -1.11), and both sleep duration and sleep start time variability are slightly higher than average (Z-scores 0.43 and 0.66). These variability metrics have mild positive correlations with CES-D. Additionally, the participant reports slightly below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46), which is also mildly positively correlated with CES-D. These factors, however, are few in number and demonstrate only weak to moderate correlations with CES-D, making their individual and combined impact on the overall CES-D score likely minimal compared to the other indicators.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that this participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The robust psychological well-being, characterized by very low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, low stress, and high health satisfaction, provides a powerful foundation for lower depressive symptoms. These self-reported traits show strong and consistent correlations with CES-D, aligning with a favorable outcome. Physiological metrics, including a low resting heart rate and well-regulated circadian heart rate rhythms, further support this interpretation. While there are some indications of slightly suboptimal objective sleep patterns (low duration, higher variability), these are counterbalanced by subjectively better-than-average sleep quality relative to peers and have only weak correlations with CES-D. The minor concern regarding trust is also outweighed by the breadth and strength of the other positive indicators. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the multimodal data suggests a CES-D score well within the lower range of the study population.

The participant’s self-reported psychological and behavioral data reveal a pattern of elevated anxiety, diminished self-esteem, and declining academic performance, alongside significant lifestyle characteristics. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 51.0 places the participant in the ""anxious"" classification (Z-score 0.96), indicating higher-than-average trait anxiety, a factor strongly and positively correlated with depressive symptoms (correlation 0.82). Complementing this, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) score of 28.0 (Z-score -1.43) reflects considerably lower self-esteem compared to the study population, which is also strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting that lower self-esteem aligns with higher depressive symptom burden. Academically, the participant's GPA exhibits a concerning downward trend across semesters, from 3.33 in Fall 2015 to 2.31 in Fall 2016, a behavioral indicator often associated with academic disengagement or difficulty concentrating. Sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" with a score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59), indicating subjective sleep difficulties. Health satisfaction is also below average (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.95), showing a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39). While the participant reports above-average current happiness (Score 4.0, Z-score 0.55), this stands in contrast to the more stable trait measures of anxiety and self-esteem and the negative correlation observed between happiness and CES-D. Perceived stress levels are average (Score 21.0, Z-score -0.17) and weakly correlated with CES-D.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a notable lack of physical activity, reporting ""Not at all"" for exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, corresponding to significantly low Z-scores (e.g., -1.93 for Exercised Alone, -1.58 for Exercised with Others). This sedentary lifestyle, particularly the absence of exercise with others, shows a negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.23), implying that reduced physical activity is associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Recreational habits show a preference for passive entertainment, with above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and using the internet (Z-score 0.85), coupled with below-average time socializing with friends (31 minutes per hour, Z-score -0.62) and no engagement in video games, reading, or sedentary hobbies. Alcohol consumption (beer) is slightly above average (Z-score 1.01), but other substance usage is reported as ""Not at all.""

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian rhythm metrics provide further insights. The participant's median sleep duration is 6 hours 32 minutes (Z-score -0.81), indicating shorter than average sleep. Despite this insufficient duration, sleep duration variability and sleep start time variability are low (Z-score -1.02 and -0.64 respectively), suggesting a consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule with a median sleep start time of 02:45:29. The circadian rhythm derived from heart rate data displays high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.74), reflecting a highly regular daily pattern, and a high amplitude (Z-score 1.16), indicating robust physiological changes across the day. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, occurs late in the evening at 7:04 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates significantly elevated heart rates during the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 9-10 PM Z-score 2.27, 11-12 AM Z-score 2.2, and particularly 12-1 AM Z-score 1.72). Conversely, heart rate deviations are notably low during mid-morning (e.g., 11-12 PM Z-score -2.93), suggesting lower physiological arousal during typical academic or active periods. This pattern of late-night physiological activity and late acrophase aligns with the reported late sleep start time and may indicate a phase-delayed circadian rhythm or evening hyperarousal.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50% of the study population) is robust and multifaceted. The participant exhibits significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.96) and markedly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.43), both of which are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.82 and -0.71, respectively). Behaviorally, a consistent decline in academic performance (GPA from 3.33 to 2.31) and a pronounced lack of physical exercise across all categories (Z-scores below -1.0 for all exercise types, with negative correlations to CES-D) are strong indicators of functional impairment and reduced motivation often associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Additionally, reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 8.0), below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95), and reduced social engagement (Z-score -0.62 for socializing with friends) further support this interpretation. Wearable data indicates insufficient sleep duration (Z-score -0.81) and notable physiological hypoarousal during late morning hours (11-12 PM heart rate deviation Z-score -2.93), which could align with fatigue or low energy.

Conversely, evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50% of the study population) is limited and less impactful. The participant reports above-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55), but this single positive self-report is contradicted by multiple stable trait measures and behavioral indicators. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score -0.17) and weakly correlated with CES-D. While the participant displays a highly stable (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.74) and robust (Amplitude Z-score 1.16) heart rate-based circadian rhythm, these metrics show negligible correlation with CES-D, suggesting they do not directly mitigate the strong indicators of distress. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) could be interpreted as a positive sign, but its correlation with CES-D is weak and positive, implying that *more* naps are associated with higher CES-D.

Considering the cumulative weight of evidence, particularly the pronounced indicators of anxiety, low self-esteem, declining academic function, lack of exercise, and disturbed sleep, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is highly likely to place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

79341,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile. Self-reported data indicate an average level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.03), yet the participant is classified as ""anxious,"" a status that strongly correlates with higher depressive symptoms (0.81). Contrastingly, self-reported happiness is significantly lower than the population mean (Z-score -1.61), which also negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting a potential disposition towards lower mood. However, perceived stress is markedly lower than average (Z-score -1.8), and notably, this metric positively correlates with CES-D (0.28), implying that lower stress is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is within the average range (Z-score 0.11), while trust and health satisfaction are slightly below average (Z-scores -0.46 and -0.28, respectively), both of which negatively correlate with CES-D.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical activity, reporting above-average frequencies for exercising alone, exercising with others, and participating in sports (Z-scores ranging from 0.53 to 1.07). These exercise habits typically correlate negatively with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports no use of alcohol or recreational drugs, indicating a lifestyle that is generally healthier than the population average in these respects (Z-scores from -0.31 to -1.3). Recreational habits show a notable preference for video games, with usage significantly higher than average (Z-score 1.71), alongside above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies and listening to music. Conversely, engagement in reading and other sedentary hobbies is below average, and internet usage is slightly lower than the population mean.

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), suggesting satisfaction with their sleep. Objectively, however, Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.51). The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:50:44, though the variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time is average or slightly below average (Z-scores -0.04 and -0.32, respectively), indicating some consistency in their sleep schedule. Napping is absent, also below the population average (Z-score -0.86).

Physiological data from wearables reveal a highly regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score 0.91) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.98) are both significantly above average, indicating a consistent daily pattern in heart rate activity. The participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 64.24 bpm, Z-score -1.32) and resting heart rate (48.25 bpm, Z-score -1.18) are notably lower than the population average. These lower baseline heart rates positively correlate with CES-D (0.19), suggesting that a lower general physiological activity level might be associated with higher depressive symptoms in this context. Despite the low baseline, hourly heart rate deviations demonstrate a robust daily rhythm, with a deep physiological trough in the early morning hours (e.g., -24.83 bpm deviation at 4-5 AM, Z-score -1.11) and a pronounced peak in activity during the late morning and early afternoon (e.g., 20.05 bpm deviation at 12-1 PM, Z-score 1.87). This indicates a significant physiological response to daily demands, despite a generally lower cardiovascular baseline.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a higher CES-D score is the participant's significantly lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61), which exhibits a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). This indicates that low happiness is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant's slightly below-average trust (Z-score -0.46) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.28), both negatively correlated with CES-D, could contribute to a higher symptom burden. The classification of ""anxious"" on the STAI, despite an average Z-score for trait anxiety, suggests a subjective experience that could align with depressive symptomatology, especially given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D. Furthermore, the lower Mesor and resting heart rate, while potentially indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, show a positive correlation with CES-D, which might suggest a lower physiological arousal level that could accompany some depressive states. Below-average sleep duration (Z-score -0.51) also aligns with a risk factor for higher depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards a lower or average CES-D score. Most notably, the participant reports significantly lower perceived stress (Z-score -1.8), a metric that positively correlates with CES-D (0.28). This strong indicator suggests that lower stress levels are associated with lower depressive symptoms. Concurrently, the participant reports good self-reported sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8), a robust protective factor against depression. High engagement in various forms of exercise (all Z-scores > 0.5) is consistently associated with lower CES-D scores, as indicated by their negative correlations. The complete absence of substance use also generally aligns with better mental health outcomes. From a physiological perspective, the high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.91) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98) of heart rate suggest highly regular and consistent circadian rhythms, a pattern typically associated with improved well-being. Crucially, while the STAI trait anxiety score is classified as ""anxious,"" its Z-score of -0.03 indicates it is within the average range for the population. Given the very strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D, an average STAI score would predict an average or lower CES-D, not an elevated one. Similarly, average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), with a strong negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, also suggests a lower CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile presents a strong contrast between low self-reported happiness and very low perceived stress. While the low happiness, trust, and health satisfaction could suggest an elevated CES-D, these are substantially counterbalanced by robust indicators of well-being and resilience. The exceptionally low perceived stress (Z-score -1.8) is a powerful argument for lower depressive symptomatology. This, combined with consistent above-average physical activity, self-reported good sleep quality, complete abstinence from substance use, and highly stable circadian rhythms, forms a comprehensive protective profile. Furthermore, key psychological traits like trait anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem are within the population's average range. Given their strong correlations with CES-D, these average scores would predict a CES-D score that is not significantly elevated. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence, especially the strong behavioral and physiological protective factors and the average scores on strongly correlated psychological measures, suggests the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

83536,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"The participant's psychological and behavioral data reveal a profile generally associated with positive well-being and adaptive coping mechanisms, with some indications of sleep pattern irregularities.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

**Psychological Well-being and Perceived Stress:** The participant demonstrates a favorable psychological profile. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (Score 26.0, Z-score -1.51), classifying them as ""not anxious"" relative to the study population. Self-reported happiness is significantly elevated (Current Score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), and self-esteem is above average (Score 41.0, Z-score 0.4). Perceived stress levels are slightly below the population mean (Score 21.0, Z-score -0.17). Additionally, satisfaction with physical health is considerably high (Score 6.0, Z-score 1.3), further contributing to a positive self-assessment. Interpersonal trust is observed to be around the population average (Score 3.17, Z-score -0.14). These indicators collectively suggest a robust psychological disposition with lower anxiety, higher self-regard, and greater overall life satisfaction.

**Lifestyle and Behavioral Habits:** The participant exhibits a pattern of generally healthy lifestyle behaviors. Substance usage is low, with significantly less recreational and non-prescribed drug use than the population average, and moderate alcohol consumption. Exercise frequency is slightly above average, both when exercising alone (Z-score 0.32) and with others (Z-score 0.53). Leisure activities show a preference for active engagement over passive consumption; the participant spends less time watching TV/videos (Z-score -0.62) and playing video games (Z-score -0.56) compared to peers. Notably, the participant spends significantly more time listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95), suggesting a rich and socially connected leisure life. Engagement in sedentary hobbies is notably low (Z-score -0.96).

**Sleep Patterns:** Self-reported sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI (Score 6.0), indicates ""Disturbed Sleep."" However, the corresponding Z-score (-0.33) suggests that this disturbance is slightly less severe than the average for the study population experiencing sleep difficulties. Objective sleep metrics from wearables indicate an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes (Z-score -0.13). The participant exhibits relatively consistent sleep durations, with a lower-than-average standard deviation (84 minutes, Z-score -0.39). Conversely, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:25:00, and there is a slightly higher-than-average variability in sleep start times (99 minutes, Z-score 0.35). The participant does not report napping (Z-score -0.86). This overall pattern suggests adequate total sleep duration with good consistency in duration, but a late and somewhat irregular sleep onset schedule.

**Cardiovascular Activity and Circadian Rhythms:** The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (56.4 bpm, Z-score -0.21), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm parameters are largely within typical population ranges; interdaily stability and amplitude are average (Z-scores 0.0 and -0.07, respectively). The MESOR (mean heart rate) is also average (Z-score 0.04). However, intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.74), suggesting more fluctuations in heart rate throughout the day. The acrophase, representing the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:12 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveals a generally characteristic diurnal pattern: significantly lower heart rates are observed during typical sleep hours (e.g., -23.37 at 6-7 AM), while elevated rates are present during daytime and early evening active periods (e.g., 14.46 at 7-8 PM). A slightly higher-than-average heart rate deviation is observed during the 2-3 AM window (Z-score 1.01), which could suggest a minor degree of physiological arousal or restlessness during deep sleep. However, the overall daily heart rate pattern is consistent with a healthy physiological response to activity and rest.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators consistent with lower depressive symptomatology. Their trait anxiety (STAI) is significantly lower than the population average (Z-score -1.51), and trait anxiety shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), suggesting a substantially lower CES-D score. Similarly, self-reported happiness is significantly higher (Z-score 1.64) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), further indicating a lower depressive burden. High self-esteem (Z-score 0.4) also strongly inversely correlates with CES-D (-0.71). Perceived stress is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.28). Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score 1.3) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). Lifestyle factors such as above-average exercise frequency and fewer naps, which are weakly negatively correlated with CES-D, also support a lower symptom profile. Objectively, sleep duration consistency is higher than average (Z-score -0.39), a factor weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting more stable sleep patterns. The participant's resting heart rate is also slightly below average, a marker of good cardiovascular health, and weakly positively correlated with CES-D, aligning with lower depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
There are fewer and generally weaker indicators suggesting a higher CES-D score. The self-reported PSQI score of 6.0 classifies sleep as ""Disturbed,"" a condition generally associated with higher CES-D. However, the PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates this disturbance is less pronounced than for many in the study population. The participant's median sleep start time is late (02:25:00), and there is slightly higher variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.35), which is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.22), potentially suggesting a less regular sleep schedule linked to higher symptoms. Additionally, significantly high engagement in listening to music (Z-score 2.06) is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.26), which could imply it functions as a coping mechanism, though the correlation is not strong. An elevated heart rate deviation during 2-3 AM (Z-score 1.01) might suggest some sleep disturbance or physiological arousal during a typical rest period. Intradaily variability in heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.74), but its weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.05) does not support a higher CES-D score.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence strongly suggests that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The robust psychological profile, characterized by exceptionally low trait anxiety, high happiness, and strong self-esteem, provides compelling evidence for lower depressive symptomatology, especially given the strong correlations of these factors with CES-D. While some sleep irregularities are noted, particularly concerning sleep onset time and variability, the objective sleep duration consistency is good, and the self-reported sleep disturbance is less severe than the average for the affected population. The few factors that weakly correlate with higher CES-D are outweighed by the numerous, more strongly correlated protective factors.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
67608,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

This participant exhibits a robust profile of psychological well-being, characterized by notably low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.51), significantly elevated self-esteem (RSES Z-score = 0.96), and a high level of self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64). These indicators, which strongly correlate negatively with depressive symptoms (STAI correlation = 0.81, Self-Esteem correlation = -0.71, Happiness correlation = -0.46), suggest a protective psychological disposition. Further supporting this positive outlook are above-average levels of interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.5) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.22), both of which show a negative correlation with depressive symptoms. The participant reports average levels of perceived stress (Z-score = -0.17) and maintains consistent, high academic performance across semesters, which typically aligns with effective coping strategies and overall well-being. Physical activity habits are positive, with frequent exercise performed alone and regular participation in sports. Substance use is moderate, with low correlations to depressive symptoms.

Despite a self-reported classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI score = 7.0, Z-score = 0.13), objective wearable data indicate remarkably consistent sleep patterns. The participant's median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes is average for the population, and the standard deviation of sleep duration (Z-score = -0.98) is notably lower than average, suggesting high day-to-day consistency in sleep length. Similarly, the standard deviation of sleep start times (Z-score = -1.24) is significantly below the population mean, demonstrating highly regular sleep onset. This objective consistency in sleep timing and duration, with lower variability being associated with lower CES-D, contrasts with the subjective experience of disturbed sleep. The median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:13:59. There is also a slightly higher frequency of daily napping (Z-score = 0.61), which exhibits a weak positive correlation with depressive symptoms.

The participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythm demonstrates a relatively stable interdaily rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 0.58) but a significantly high level of intradaily variability (Z-score = 1.58). This suggests that while the overall daily rhythm is consistent across days, there is fragmentation or more rapid changes in physiological activity within each day. The mean heart rate over the recording period (Mesor Z-score = -0.78) and resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.54) are both lower than the population average, indicating good cardiovascular fitness. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:08 PM. Hourly heart rate data reveal typical lower activity during early morning sleep. However, there are significant peaks in physiological arousal observed in the late morning (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score = 1.48; 10-11 AM, Z-score = 1.36) and particularly in the late evening, with a very pronounced elevation between 8-9 PM (Z-score = 2.32) and again between 10-11 PM (Z-score = 1.49). This late evening arousal may contribute to the subjective experience of disturbed sleep or reflect evening activities.

A notable area of observation lies in the participant's self-reported daily recreational habits, particularly social engagement. The frequency of socializing with friends is markedly low (Z-score = -2.2), significantly below the population average. Other recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, reading, and engaging in sedentary hobbies are also reported as ""Do not do"" or ""15 minutes or less,"" placing them below or significantly below average. While internet usage is moderate, and listening to music is low, the overall pattern suggests very limited engagement in a variety of recreational pursuits, especially those involving social interaction. Although the correlation between socializing with friends and CES-D is very low (-0.02), reduced social engagement is a commonly recognized behavioral pattern that can be relevant to mental health, despite the otherwise strong psychological well-being indicators for this participant.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several strong indicators that are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI) is very low (Z-score = -1.51) and exhibits a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, indicating that lower anxiety is associated with lower CES-D scores. Similarly, self-esteem (Z-score = 0.96) and current happiness (Z-score = 1.64) are significantly higher than the population average and show strong negative correlations with CES-D (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively), suggesting a notably lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Higher levels of interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.5) and health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.22), both negatively correlated with CES-D, further support this. Objectively, sleep patterns are highly consistent, with significantly lower standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score = -0.98) and sleep start time (Z-score = -1.24). These consistencies are positively correlated with CES-D, implying that lower variability in sleep is linked to lower CES-D scores. Physiological metrics like Mesor (average heart rate, Z-score = -0.78) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = -0.54) are also lower than average, and their positive correlation with CES-D suggests lower depressive symptoms for this participant.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards potentially higher depressive symptomatology is less pronounced and often accompanied by weak correlations. The participant reports subjective ""Disturbed Sleep"" via the PSQI (score = 7.0, Z-score = 0.13), a known correlate of depression. A highly salient behavioral observation is the very low frequency of socializing with friends (Z-score = -2.2), which is a common behavioral marker for social withdrawal often seen in depression. However, the correlation between this specific behavior and CES-D is very weak (-0.02). The participant also shows significantly higher intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score = 1.58), which can sometimes indicate fragmented activity rhythms associated with mood disorders, though its correlation with CES-D is weak and slightly negative (-0.05). Slightly increased daily napping (Z-score = 0.61) shows a weak positive correlation (0.22) with CES-D. Lastly, pronounced physiological arousal in the late evening, particularly between 8-9 PM (Z-score = 2.32), could be indicative of heightened stress or activity patterns that interfere with pre-sleep relaxation.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When holistically evaluating the evidence, the highly significant and strongly correlated indicators of low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness present a compelling case for a lower burden of depressive symptoms. These robust psychological strengths, coupled with good physiological health (low resting heart rate and mesor) and exceptional sleep consistency, strongly suggest resilience against depressive states. While the very low social engagement and subjective sleep disturbance are notable concerns, the provided correlations for these specific metrics with CES-D are either weak or, in the case of subjective sleep, not directly provided. The weight of the evidence, particularly from the strongly correlated self-report measures reflecting core aspects of well-being, points towards a participant whose overall depressive symptom burden is likely lower than average.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
19735,34.0,0.9559585492227979,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress alongside some areas of adaptive functioning. Psychologically, there is clear evidence of elevated anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 47.0, which is classified as anxious and falls above the population mean (Z-score = 0.56). This is compounded by notably low self-esteem (RSES score 31.0, Z-score = -1.01) and below-average levels of happiness (Z-score = -0.53), trust (Z-score = -1.1), and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -0.45). These elements collectively suggest a considerable internal struggle, despite the self-reported perceived stress being lower than the population average (PSS score 19.0, Z-score = -0.71). Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance, with a GPA improving to 3.9 in the latest semester, indicating maintained cognitive and academic functioning.

Behaviorally, the participant displays pronounced social withdrawal and a reduced engagement in various recreational activities. Socializing with friends is reported as ""15 minutes or less"" per day, an extremely low frequency relative to the study population (Z-score = -2.2). Similarly, participation in exercising with others and sports is minimal or absent, reinforcing a pattern of limited social interaction in leisure activities. Engagement in other common recreational pursuits such as watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, and listening to music is also markedly low. In contrast, recreational drug use is exceptionally high, occurring ""1-2 times a month"" (Z-score = 3.52), alongside above-average alcohol consumption (beer, wine/liquor each ""1-2 times a week""). These substance use patterns may suggest maladaptive coping mechanisms or a search for external means of mood regulation.

In terms of sleep and circadian rhythms, the participant reports disturbed subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (score 6.0), surpassing the threshold for significant disturbance, although the Z-score is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.33) when compared to the study population. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 48 minutes, which is longer than average (Z-score = 0.77). However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:01:45 AM, suggesting a delayed sleep phase. The variability in sleep duration and start time is approximately average for the population. Heart rate-derived circadian metrics show average interdaily stability and slightly below-average intradaily variability. While the heart rate amplitude is higher than average (Z-score = 1.13), indicating a robust physiological swing, the autocorrelation at 24 hours is lower than average (Z-score = -0.95), suggesting a less consistent or predictable day-to-day rhythmicity in overall heart rate patterns. The participant's resting heart rate of 50.3 bpm is notably lower than the population average (Z-score = -0.93), which typically signifies good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly heart rate data confirms a clear diurnal pattern, with the lowest deviations from mesor observed in the early morning hours (e.g., -25.59 bpm at 4-5 AM) and peaks during the day (e.g., 14.29 bpm at 11 AM-12 PM), consistent with typical activity cycles. The acrophase at 5:26 PM indicates peak physiological arousal in the late afternoon.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To determine if the participant’s CES-D score falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the cumulative evidence from self-report and wearable data, particularly focusing on metrics strongly correlated with CES-D.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant's STAI score of 47.0 (Z-score = 0.56), indicative of anxious traits, shows a very strong positive correlation (0.82) with the CES-D score. This suggests that individuals with higher anxiety in this population also tend to have higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the low self-esteem (Z-score = -1.01), low happiness (Z-score = -0.53), low trust (Z-score = -1.1), and below-average health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.45) all exhibit moderate to strong negative correlations with the CES-D score (-0.71, -0.46, -0.41, -0.39 respectively). These robust correlations imply that the participant's deficits in these areas are likely associated with a higher depressive symptom burden.
Behaviorally, the extremely low frequency of socializing with friends (Z-score = -2.2) and exercising with others (Z-score = -1.58), while showing weak or zero correlation with CES-D, are significant indicators of social withdrawal and reduced motivation, which are core features of depression. The exceptionally high recreational drug use (Z-score = 3.52) could also serve as a maladaptive coping mechanism for underlying emotional distress. Although the PSQI Z-score is slightly below average, the raw score of 6.0 clinically indicates disturbed sleep, a common symptom associated with depression. Finally, the lower-than-average 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate (Z-score = -0.95) suggests some disruption in the regularity of physiological rhythms, which has been linked to mood disorders.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Conversely, some data points suggest potentially lower or average depressive symptoms, or areas of resilience. The participant's perceived stress (PSS score 19.0, Z-score = -0.71) is notably below the population average, and its correlation with CES-D is weak (0.29), indicating lower subjective stress may not align with higher depressive symptoms. Academic performance remains high and improving, suggesting good cognitive and executive functioning in that domain. Physiologically, the resting heart rate is low (Z-score = -0.93), indicative of good physical fitness, and the heart rate circadian amplitude is robust (Z-score = 1.13), which generally implies a healthy physiological rhythm, despite the lower 24-hour autocorrelation. Objectively, sleep duration is longer than average, though subjective sleep quality is poor.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the evidence, the highly correlated psychological distress measures (high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, low trust, low health satisfaction) present a compelling case for an elevated depressive symptom burden. These factors, which are often central to the experience of depression, are robustly linked to the CES-D score within this study population. While the participant maintains high academic performance and reports lower perceived stress, these strengths do not fully offset the pervasive and severe difficulties in psychological well-being and social engagement. The extreme social withdrawal and very high recreational drug use are also significant behavioral markers often associated with distress and depression, even if their direct correlations with CES-D are weaker in this specific dataset. The disturbed subjective sleep quality, despite adequate objective duration, further contributes to this picture. Therefore, the weight of evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a blend of positive and potentially challenging aspects. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (Score: 37.0, Z-score: -0.43), falling into the 'not anxious' classification. This low anxiety level correlates strongly and positively with lower CES-D scores (r=0.81 for higher anxiety with higher CES-D, thus low anxiety here suggests lower CES-D). Concurrently, self-esteem is above average (Score: 43.0, Z-score: 0.68), a factor that also shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71), suggesting it serves as a significant protective factor against depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is exceptionally high (Score: 6.0, Z-score: 1.3), which also negatively correlates with CES-D (r=-0.39). However, self-reported current happiness is below the population average (Score: 3.0, Z-score: -0.53), a metric that negatively correlates with CES-D (r=-0.46), indicating a potential area of concern. Perceived stress levels are near the population average (Score: 21.0, Z-score: -0.17).

An examination of sleep patterns reveals a mixed picture. Subjective sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, indicates disturbed sleep (Score: 8.0, Z-score: 0.59). Despite this, objective Fitbit data show a significantly above-average median sleep duration (8 hours 13 minutes, Z-score: 1.28). However, considerable variability exists in both sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 169 minutes, Z-score: 1.55) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation: 141 minutes, Z-score: 1.27), both of which correlate positively with CES-D (r=0.2 and r=0.22 respectively). This suggests an inconsistent sleep schedule despite adequate total sleep time. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data reveal a relatively stable physiological rhythm; Interdaily Stability is high (0.56, Z-score: 1.24) and Intradaily Variability is notably low (0.25, Z-score: -2.08), indicating consistent daily patterns with minimal fragmentation. The circadian rhythm exhibits a robust amplitude (14.04, Z-score: 1.05) and a slightly above-average mesor (76.44, Z-score: 0.34), with the acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurring in the late afternoon at 5:58 PM.

Behavioral engagement in physical activity is robust. The participant reports exercising alone frequently (three times a week or more, Z-score: 1.07), exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.53), and participating in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91). These exercise behaviors are all above average and correlate negatively with CES-D, indicating potential protective effects. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates typical diurnal patterns, with heart rate lowest during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -20.87 bpm at 5-6 AM) and peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 14.09 bpm at 2-3 PM, 16.07 bpm at 6-7 PM). Notably, heart rate remains elevated into the late evening (10-11 PM deviation: 15.14 bpm, Z-score: 1.37), suggesting sustained physiological activity or arousal before a more significant decline towards sleep. Recreational habits include significantly above-average engagement in video games (1-2 hours daily, Z-score: 2.47) and above-average internet usage (2-3 hours daily, Z-score: 0.85) and watching TV/videos (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: 0.64). Engagement in socializing and reading is near average, while listening to music is below average.

General lifestyle behaviors largely align with population averages or suggest typical patterns. Substance usage includes above-average beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score: 1.01), with wine/liquor use being average and recreational or non-prescribed drug use reported as 'not at all.' Academic performance, as indicated by stable GPA across semesters (ranging from 3.23 to 3.48), is healthy. The participant's Body Mass Index of 24.39 falls within the normal range. Interpersonal trust is close to the population mean (Score: 3.17, Z-score: -0.14).

### Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) includes disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 8, Z-score 0.59) and significantly elevated variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 1.55) and sleep start time (Z-score 1.27), which all correlate positively with CES-D scores. Additionally, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlates with CES-D (r=-0.46), suggesting a potential contribution to depressive symptomatology. Sustained elevated heart rate into the late evening also hints at prolonged physiological arousal.

Conversely, there is substantial evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile). The participant exhibits low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43) and notably high self-esteem (Z-score 0.68), both of which are strongly correlated with lower CES-D scores (r=0.81 for STAI and r=-0.71 for self-esteem). High satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.3) also negatively correlates with CES-D (r=-0.39). Perceived stress levels are near the population average (Z-score -0.17), not indicating elevated burden. Furthermore, the participant engages in robust physical activity, with above-average frequencies for exercising alone, with others, and in sports, all of which correlate negatively with CES-D. Objective circadian rhythm parameters (Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability, Amplitude) generally indicate a consistent and well-structured physiological rhythm, and median sleep duration is above average.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the strong protective factors, particularly high self-esteem and low trait anxiety, which have substantial inverse correlations with CES-D scores, appear to outweigh the indicators of sleep disturbance and lower happiness. The robust physical activity, average perceived stress, and overall stable physiological circadian rhythm metrics further support a lower burden of depressive symptoms. Therefore, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is more likely to place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

96613,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile reveals a pattern indicative of relatively robust psychological well-being, characterized by low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72, classified as ""not anxious"") and notably high self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.96). This is further supported by above-average health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.05) and interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.5). However, subjective happiness is reported as lower than the population average (Z-score: -0.53), and despite objective metrics, subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed according to the PSQI (score: 6.0). Perceived stress levels are within the average range (Z-score: 0.1). Behaviorally, the participant exhibits high engagement in social exercise (Z-score: 1.23) and sports (Z-score: 0.91), while demonstrating a marked avoidance of solitary exercise (Z-score: -1.93). Recreational habits show a tendency towards passive entertainment, with above-average time spent on watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 0.64), video games (Z-score: 0.96), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score: 1.41), juxtaposed with less time spent on internet usage, music, and reading. Substance use, particularly beer consumption, is slightly above average, though other categories are average or lower.

Objective wearable data complements these self-reports by illustrating a well-defined and robust physiological circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.23) and mesor (Z-score: -0.86), alongside a significantly higher heart rate amplitude (Z-score: 1.26), suggesting a strong physiological fluctuation between active and rest periods. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor confirm this robust rhythm, showing pronounced decreases during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -26.65 beats/min, Z-score: -1.29 at 6-7 AM) and significant elevations during the afternoon and evening (e.g., +20.09 beats/min, Z-score: 2.02 at 3-4 PM; +18.08 beats/min, Z-score: 1.49 at 8-9 PM), indicating active engagement throughout the day. Circadian regularity measures show slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.33) but also somewhat elevated intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.67), which might suggest some fragmentation in activity patterns within the day, though overall rhythm is consistent. Objectively, sleep statistics reveal a significantly longer median sleep duration (8 hours 29 minutes, Z-score: 1.61) and highly consistent sleep start times (standard deviation Z-score: -1.06), with lower variability in sleep duration (Z-score: -0.53), despite the self-reported sleep disturbance. The participant also reports above-average daily napping (Z-score: 0.94).

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Several strong indicators suggest the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom 50% of the study population. The most prominent evidence comes from self-reported psychological traits: a significantly low trait anxiety score (STAI Z-score: -0.72), classified as ""not anxious,"" which strongly positively correlates with CES-D (0.81). Conversely, the participant reports notably high self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.96), which has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). Additionally, above-average health satisfaction (Z-score: 1.05) and trust (Z-score: 0.5) both correlate moderately negatively with CES-D, further supporting lower depressive symptomatology. Behaviorally, consistent and long objective sleep duration (Z-score: 1.61) and highly regular sleep start times (Z-score: -1.06 for standard deviation) reflect structured routines, which are generally protective. Furthermore, engagement in social exercise and sports is higher than average, with weak negative correlations to CES-D. Physiologically, a robust circadian rhythm with a high heart rate amplitude (Z-score: 1.26) and low resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.23) are typically associated with better health and, though weakly correlated, point towards lower CES-D.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, certain data points suggest a potential for higher depressive symptoms. The participant reports lower-than-average subjective happiness (Z-score: -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), implying a potentially higher CES-D score. Subjective sleep quality is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"" by the PSQI (score: 6.0), a common co-occurrence with depressive symptoms, despite objective sleep metrics indicating sufficient duration and consistency. The participant also engages in more daily napping (Z-score: 0.94), which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Furthermore, a tendency towards higher engagement in passive recreational activities (e.g., watching TV/videos/movies, video games, sedentary hobbies, with Z-scores up to 1.41) and lower engagement in active internet use, music listening, and reading, collectively show weak positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting these patterns might be associated with slightly elevated symptoms. Intradaily variability in heart rate is somewhat elevated (Z-score: 0.67), potentially indicating some fragmentation, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the most impactful indicators for evaluating depressive symptoms are the highly salient self-reported psychological traits. The participant's significantly low trait anxiety and notably high self-esteem, both exhibiting strong correlations with CES-D, provide compelling evidence for lower depressive symptomatology. These strong psychological protective factors heavily outweigh the weaker, moderately negative correlation with subjective happiness and the self-reported disturbed sleep, especially when objective sleep metrics indicate ample duration and high consistency. While some sedentary behaviors and increased napping weakly suggest higher CES-D, the overall physiological profile, including a robust heart rate circadian rhythm and excellent cardiovascular fitness (low RHR, high HR amplitude), aligns with a healthier psychological state. Therefore, considering the predominant strength of evidence from core psychological traits and objective physiological data, the participant's profile is more consistent with lower depressive symptoms.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
50766,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The participant demonstrates a profile characterized by strong psychological resilience and a well-regulated physiological circadian rhythm, despite reporting notable subjective sleep disturbances and remarkably low social engagement. Academically, the participant maintains an exemplary GPA, ranging from 3.83 to 4.0, suggesting high levels of cognitive functioning and commitment that are typically less compromised in individuals with lower depressive symptom burden.

Psychologically, the participant reports low trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 37.0 (Z-score -0.43), indicating a classification of ""not anxious."" This is a highly salient feature, as STAI scores exhibit a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, suggesting that lower anxiety proneness is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Complementarily, self-esteem is notably high (score 43.0, Z-score 0.68), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), serving as another significant protective factor against depression. Perceived stress is also reported as low (score 19.0, Z-score -0.71), aligning with a reduced likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology given its positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D. Health satisfaction is high (score 5.56, Z-score 0.97), a factor negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). However, self-reported current happiness is somewhat below the population average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), indicating an area of potential vulnerability. Trust levels are slightly below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.46), though their correlation with CES-D is moderate and negative (-0.41).

Sleep patterns present a notable area of concern, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0. This score suggests clinically significant sleep disturbance, placing the participant slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.13) for sleep difficulties. While Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 29 minutes (Z-score 0.37), suggesting adequate sleep quantity, the subjective experience of disturbed sleep is significant. The standard deviation of sleep start time is relatively low (54 minutes, Z-score -0.63), which implies a consistent sleep schedule initiation, a positive indicator for sleep hygiene, and is positively correlated with CES-D (0.22), suggesting this consistency may be a mitigating factor against symptoms. However, the participant reports more frequent daily naps than average (Z-score 0.61), a behavior positively correlated with CES-D (0.21), potentially indicating compensatory napping due to fragmented or poor-quality nocturnal sleep.

Physiological data from wearable metrics reveal a robust and stable heart rate-based circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (value 0.58, Z-score 1.41), signifying strong day-to-day regularity in activity patterns, while intradaily variability is low (value 0.38, Z-score -1.16), suggesting smooth and consistent physiological transitions throughout the day. Both metrics are indicative of a well-regulated circadian system. The circadian rhythm exhibits a high amplitude (value 15.81, Z-score 1.63), reflecting a substantial difference between peak and trough heart rates, which is typically associated with better health and is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.1). The MESOR (mean heart rate, 78.81 bpm, Z-score 0.66) and resting heart rate (58.1 bpm, Z-score -0.01) are within healthy population ranges. The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurs at 5:23 PM, aligning with a typical afternoon/early evening peak in physiological arousal. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor demonstrate a clear diurnal pattern, with significantly lower heart rates during nocturnal hours (e.g., -23.34 bpm from 5-6 AM) and elevated rates during active daytime periods, particularly peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., +23.21 bpm from 3-4 PM; +20.77 bpm from 6-7 PM), reflecting normative daily physiological activity.

Behaviorally, a salient finding is the extremely low self-reported time spent socializing with friends (""15 minutes or less,"" Z-score -2.2). Despite a near-zero correlation with CES-D in this dataset (-0.01), this level of social isolation is notable. Exercise habits are generally active, characterized by frequent exercise with others (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.23) and regular sports participation (Z-score 0.91), contrasting with very infrequent solitary exercise (Z-score -1.18). Substance usage patterns show elevated beer consumption (""1-2 times a week,"" Z-score 1.01) and recreational drug use (""Less than 1-2 times a month,"" Z-score 1.61), with the latter positively correlated with CES-D (0.16). Other daily recreational habits, such as internet usage, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, are reported at average or below-average levels.

To assess whether the participant's overall depressive symptom burden (as measured by CES-D) falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, a holistic review of the evidence indicates a strong likelihood of the participant having a CES-D score in the bottom 50th percentile. The population's 50th percentile for CES-D is 11.5.

Evidence suggesting a *lower or average* CES-D score (bottom 50%):
The participant exhibits robust psychological protective factors that are highly correlated with lower CES-D scores. Specifically, the very low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43) has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, meaning low anxiety is strongly associated with low depressive symptoms. Similarly, high self-esteem (Z-score 0.68) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), indicating its protective role. Low perceived stress (Z-score -0.71) and high health satisfaction (Z-score 0.97) further align with a reduced depressive burden, given their respective correlations (-0.28 and -0.39). Furthermore, wearable data reveals a highly stable, regular, and high-amplitude circadian rhythm (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high amplitude with Z-scores 1.41, -1.16, and 1.63 respectively), which is generally indicative of better physiological and mental health, with amplitude showing a negative correlation (-0.1) with CES-D. An active lifestyle, particularly through exercise with others (Z-score 1.23, negative correlation -0.23), and consistent high academic performance (GPA 3.83-4.0) also suggest a functional state that often accompanies lower depressive symptomatology.

Evidence suggesting an *elevated* CES-D score (top 50%):
The participant's PSQI score of 7.0 signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance, a common feature of depression. Self-reported current happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), pointing to a potential mood deficit. The extremely low level of socializing with friends (Z-score -2.2) is a notable behavioral pattern often associated with, or contributing to, depressive states, even if its correlation with CES-D in this specific dataset is near zero (-0.01). Additionally, higher recreational drug use (Z-score 1.61, positive correlation 0.16) and more frequent napping (Z-score 0.61, positive correlation 0.21) could reflect coping mechanisms or fragmented sleep patterns that sometimes co-occur with elevated depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite the presence of disturbed sleep, lower happiness, and significantly reduced social engagement, the cumulative weight of the evidence, particularly from the highly correlated psychological traits, strongly suggests a lower depressive symptom burden. The participant's low trait anxiety and high self-esteem are powerful indicators, and their strong correlations with CES-D (0.81 and -0.71, respectively) carry substantial interpretative weight. These protective psychological factors, combined with low perceived stress, high health satisfaction, a robust and stable circadian rhythm, and consistent high academic achievement, collectively point towards a profile that is more consistent with lower or average depressive symptomatology within the study population. The objective measures of physiological health and the strong subjective reports of psychological well-being tend to outweigh the negative indicators, leading to the conclusion that the participant's CES-D score is likely below the population median.

71089,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several traits associated with potential depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is slightly above the population mean (Score: 46.0, Z-score: 0.46), and this measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.81). A significantly lower level of self-esteem is reported (Score: 27.0, Z-Score: -1.57), which is strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), implying that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. This pattern is further supported by below-average self-reported happiness (Z-Score: -0.53, r = -0.46) and substantially lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: -1.45, r = -0.39). Interpersonal trust is also slightly below the population mean (Z-Score: -0.46, r = -0.41), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D. In contrast, perceived stress levels (PSS Score: 19.0, Z-Score: -0.71) are below the population average and only weakly correlated with CES-D (r = 0.28). This suggests that while trait anxiety and diminished self-worth are prominent, the participant does not experience higher-than-average day-to-day perceived stress, potentially indicating a different manifestation of psychological distress.

Objective and subjective sleep data present a somewhat contradictory but generally regular picture. While the subjective PSQI score of 6.0 classifies sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the Z-score of -0.33 indicates that the participant's subjective sleep quality is actually slightly better than the average for the study population. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a significantly longer median sleep duration of 8 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score: 1.26). Furthermore, sleep patterns exhibit high regularity, with lower-than-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.85) and sleep start time (Z-score: -0.96). The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score: -0.86). The correlations between these sleep metrics and CES-D scores are generally weak, suggesting that while subjective sleep might be perceived as disturbed, the objective regularity and duration of sleep are not strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptoms in this context.

Regarding daily activities, the participant demonstrates a pronounced lack of physical exercise, reporting ""Not at all"" for all categories (exercising alone, with others, and sports), with correspondingly low Z-scores (ranging from -1.09 to -1.93). The lack of exercise shows weak negative correlations with CES-D, indicating that lower exercise frequency tends to be associated with higher depressive symptoms. In terms of academic performance, the participant maintains consistently high GPAs across semesters, suggesting strong academic engagement and ability. Recreational habits are characterized by high engagement in sedentary activities, including significantly above-average internet usage (Z-score: 1.52) and listening to music (Z-score: 1.6), both of which show moderate positive correlations with CES-D (r = 0.25). Socializing with friends is also reported at an above-average frequency (Z-score: 0.95). Substance usage is low to moderate. This pattern of high academic achievement coupled with a sedentary lifestyle and significant engagement in specific digital recreational activities, some of which are positively associated with CES-D, suggests a compensatory or disengaged behavioral profile in relation to physical activity.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveals a state of elevated cardiovascular activity and highly regular circadian rhythms. Both the resting heart rate (71.2 bpm, Z-score: 1.55) and the MESOR (mean heart rate, 86.93 bpm, Z-score: 1.77) are significantly higher than the population average, and both exhibit positive correlations with CES-D (r = 0.19). This indicates a higher baseline physiological arousal. Despite this elevation, the heart rate-based circadian rhythm is remarkably stable and regular, characterized by significantly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: 1.23), alongside below-average intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.81). The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurs relatively late at 4:34 PM. While the regularity of the circadian rhythm itself does not strongly correlate with depressive symptoms, the consistently elevated heart rate metrics suggest a generalized state of heightened physiological arousal that may align with anxious or depressive states. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR show typical diurnal patterns but are generally higher throughout the day relative to the population's deviations, particularly during active hours, reinforcing the pattern of sustained elevated cardiovascular activity.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Multiple lines of evidence converge to suggest that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is likely in the top half of the study population distribution. Self-reported psychological traits are particularly salient: very low self-esteem (Z-score -1.57, r = -0.71) and above-average trait anxiety (Z-score 0.46, r = 0.81) are both strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores. Additionally, lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53, r = -0.46), lower health satisfaction (Z-score -1.45, r = -0.39), and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46, r = -0.41) further support this interpretation. Behaviorally, a near-complete absence of physical exercise (Z-scores from -1.09 to -1.93) is a significant factor, with lower exercise frequency generally associated with higher CES-D scores. Elevated engagement in sedentary activities like internet usage and listening to music (Z-scores 1.52 and 1.6, respectively) also shows moderate positive correlations with CES-D. Physiologically, both the resting heart rate (Z-score 1.55) and the heart rate MESOR (Z-score 1.77) are significantly elevated, indicating a state of higher baseline physiological arousal, and both are positively correlated with CES-D.

**Evidence for Low/Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Some factors suggest a lower or average depressive symptom burden. The participant reports lower-than-average perceived stress (Z-score -0.71), although its correlation with CES-D is weak (r = 0.28). Objective sleep data indicates longer median sleep duration (Z-score 1.26) and high consistency in sleep patterns (low standard deviations for duration and start time, high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability), with generally weak correlations to CES-D. While the PSQI score suggests ""disturbed sleep,"" its Z-score (-0.33) indicates subjective sleep quality is slightly *better* than the population average. Strong academic performance (consistently high GPAs) is generally a protective factor against psychological distress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite protective factors such as strong academic performance, lower perceived stress, and objectively regular and prolonged sleep, the participant's profile is dominated by indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The significant deficits in self-esteem, coupled with elevated trait anxiety, lower happiness, and reduced health satisfaction, point towards a considerable psychological burden. The physiological markers of elevated baseline heart rate and MESOR further corroborate a state of heightened arousal often accompanying affective distress. The consistent lack of physical activity and high engagement in certain sedentary recreational habits also align with patterns seen in individuals with higher depressive symptomatology. The combined strength of these negative indicators, particularly those with strong correlations to CES-D (self-esteem, STAI, RHR, MESOR), outweighs the mitigating factors. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

22688,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a notably positive self-reported psychological profile, indicating a strong buffer against depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is significantly low (Z-score = -1.41), and this measure exhibits a substantial positive correlation (r = 0.81) with CES-D scores, suggesting that the participant's low anxiety proneness is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably high (Z-score = 1.1) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), further supporting a reduced depressive symptom burden. High self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64) and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 1.22) are also observed, both moderately correlating with lower CES-D scores (r = -0.46 and r = -0.39, respectively). Interpersonal trust is moderately above average (Z-score = 0.5) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.41). While perceived stress is slightly above the population average (Z-score = 0.38), its positive correlation with CES-D is weak (r = 0.28), making its impact on depressive symptoms comparatively minor within this overall positive psychological landscape.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality according to the PSQI (Z-score = -0.8). Objective wearable data corroborate this with a significantly longer median sleep duration of 8 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score = 1.05), alongside slightly less variable sleep duration and start times compared to the study population. The participant also reports no daily naps. Despite these indicators of healthy sleep quantity and consistency, heart rate data during sleep suggest a subtle physiological anomaly. Specifically, hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor are less negative (i.e., relatively higher heart rate) during the early morning sleep hours (e.g., 3-6 am) compared to the population average, and there is an earlier and more pronounced increase in heart rate during the waking transition (7-9 am). These specific patterns of reduced nocturnal heart rate decline and earlier morning arousal show weak positive correlations with CES-D, indicating a minor physiological aspect that could be associated with slightly elevated symptoms.

The participant's physical activity and circadian rhythms present a mixed picture. While there is a high frequency of exercising with others (Z-score = 1.23, weakly negatively correlated with CES-D), the participant rarely exercises alone (Z-score = -1.93). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -1.15), Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -1.8), and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score = -1.79), are notably lower than the population average. This suggests less regular and structured physiological rhythms, as well as a reduced range of daily heart rate fluctuation. However, the correlations between these specific circadian rhythm parameters and CES-D are negligible in this dataset. The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.27) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.19). The heart rate acrophase, indicating the peak of daily cardiovascular activity, occurs in the late afternoon (4:14 PM).

The participant's recreational habits reveal a tendency towards lower engagement in several common activities such as watching TV/movies (Z-score = -1.25), reading (Z-score = -0.67), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score = -0.96), with relatively low internet usage and music listening. Conversely, engagement in video games is notably higher than average (Z-score = 0.96). Substance usage indicates above-average consumption of beer, wine, and liquor (Z-scores around 1.0) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. The correlations between these specific recreational and substance use behaviors and CES-D are generally weak to negligible, indicating they are not strong predictors of depressive symptoms in this dataset.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a lower CES-D score stems from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. The participant exhibits significantly low trait anxiety (Z-score = -1.41), which is strongly associated with lower CES-D (r = 0.81). Similarly, their high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.1) strongly correlates with lower CES-D (r = -0.71). Elevated self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64) and high satisfaction with health (Z-score = 1.22) also moderately correlate with lower CES-D (r = -0.46 and r = -0.39, respectively). Above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.5) shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.41). Furthermore, good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score = 5.0) and objectively longer sleep duration (Z-score = 1.05) are generally associated with better mental health outcomes, although their direct correlations with CES-D are negligible in this specific dataset. The participant's high frequency of exercising with others (Z-score = 1.23) also weakly correlates with lower CES-D (r = -0.23).

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a higher CES-D score is comparatively weak and less consistent. Slightly elevated perceived stress (Z-score = 0.38) shows only a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.28). The participant's resting heart rate is marginally above average (Z-score = 0.27) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.19). Physiological heart rate patterns during early morning sleep, indicating less of a heart rate dip, also show weak positive correlations with CES-D. While several circadian rhythm metrics (Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability, 24-hour Autocorrelation) are notably lower than the population average, suggesting less structured physiological patterns, their correlations with CES-D in this dataset are negligible, thus not providing strong direct evidence for a higher CES-D score.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The cumulative weight of evidence, particularly from self-reported psychological measures, strongly indicates a profile associated with lower depressive symptoms. The participant consistently reports high levels of positive traits and subjective well-being that are robustly correlated with reduced CES-D scores. While there are a few minor physiological indicators (e.g., slightly elevated perceived stress, resting heart rate, and certain heart rate deviations during sleep) that weakly correlate with higher CES-D, these are outweighed by the sheer number and strength of the positive psychological markers. The observed irregularities in circadian rhythmicity, despite being notable, lack direct correlational support with CES-D in this dataset. Therefore, the overall assessment points toward a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms.

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by generally positive self-perceptions of well-being alongside some indicators of anxiety, sleep disturbance, and social disengagement. Psychologically, they report above-average happiness (Z=0.55) and notably high satisfaction with their physical health (Z=1.05), both of which are negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, suggesting a potential buffer against elevated symptom burden. Self-esteem is reported as average (Z=-0.03), a factor that, despite its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), does not indicate a predisposition toward higher depressive symptoms in this instance. However, the participant reports slightly above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.17) and perceived stress (PSS Z=0.1), both positively correlated with CES-D, indicating some level of psychological distress. A salient finding is the significantly below-average score on interpersonal trust (Z=-1.42), which shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D, implying a potential association between lower trust and increased depressive symptomatology.

In terms of sleep and activity, the participant's self-reported sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI Score=7, Z=0.13), a common feature associated with depressive symptoms. Wearable data corroborates some sleep irregularities, showing an above-average standard deviation in sleep duration (136 minutes, Z=0.8), suggesting inconsistent sleep lengths, and an above-average frequency of daily napping (Z=0.61), which may compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep. Despite this variability in duration, sleep start times are relatively consistent (Z=-0.35). Behaviorally, the participant engages frequently in solitary exercise (Z=1.07) but significantly less in exercise with others (Z=-0.88) and sports (Z=-1.09), indicating a preference for individual physical activity rather than social forms. They also spend significantly more time on internet usage (Z=1.52) and listening to music (Z=1.13), while engaging less in activities like watching TV/videos/movies or playing video games.

Physiologically, the participant displays a generally lower cardiovascular baseline, characterized by a significantly below-average resting heart rate (47.5 bpm, Z=-1.27) and Mesor (65.92 bpm, Z=-1.1), which often reflects good physical fitness. However, the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate below-average interdaily stability (Z=-0.82), suggesting less day-to-day regularity in physiological patterns. Despite this, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is above average (Z=0.58), indicating pronounced daily fluctuations. The acrophase at 5:55 PM points to a peak in physiological activity late in the afternoon. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns: heart rates are notably below average during morning hours (e.g., 9-12 AM, with Z-scores as low as -1.85) and shift to significantly above-average levels during the afternoon and evening (e.g., 2-3 PM, 4-5 PM, 6-7 PM, with Z-scores reaching 2.06), consistent with a pattern of lower physiological arousal in the morning and heightened activity later in the day.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several factors that could contribute to an elevated CES-D score. Their self-reported anxiety (STAI Z=0.17) is slightly above the population average, and notably, STAI has a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, suggesting even a mild elevation could significantly impact depressive symptom burden. The classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" from a PSQI score of 7 (Z=0.13) indicates poorer sleep quality, a well-established correlate of depression. Furthermore, the participant's significantly below-average interpersonal trust (Z=-1.42) is associated with higher CES-D scores (correlation = -0.41), indicating a potential vulnerability. Wearable data supports concerns about sleep and rhythm stability, showing above-average variability in sleep duration (Z=0.8) and below-average interdaily stability in heart rate rhythms (Z=-0.82), both of which are often observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. The participant also engages less in social forms of exercise, which could reflect reduced social engagement.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several indicators suggest the participant may experience relatively lower or average depressive symptomatology. A key finding is their self-reported above-average happiness (Z=0.55) and significantly above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z=1.05). Both happiness and health satisfaction exhibit moderate negative correlations with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively), implying that higher scores on these metrics are associated with lower depressive symptoms. The participant's self-esteem is average (Z=-0.03), and despite its very strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), an average score does not directly point to high depressive symptom burden. Behaviorally, they consistently engage in solitary exercise at an above-average frequency (Z=1.07), a protective factor for mental health. Physiologically, their low resting heart rate (Z=-1.27) and Mesor (Z=-1.1) suggest good cardiovascular fitness, which is generally associated with better overall health outcomes. Consistent academic performance (high GPAs) also indicates functional well-being in an important life domain.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant's profile presents a dichotomy, with some indicators pointing towards elevated depressive symptoms (anxiety, disturbed sleep, low trust, circadian rhythm instability) and others strongly suggesting a lower symptom burden (high happiness, high health satisfaction, average self-esteem, good physical fitness, and academic performance). When weighing the evidence, the direct self-reports of above-average happiness and significantly above-average health satisfaction are powerful counter-indicators for high depressive symptomatology, as core features of depression often include anhedonia and somatic complaints. While anxiety and sleep disturbance are present, and low trust is a notable concern, the combined strength of positive self-reported well-being, average self-esteem, and engagement in protective behaviors like exercise, suggest that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely not in the top half of the population distribution. The presence of some risk factors may elevate their score slightly from the lowest end, but the overall picture leans towards a score that is not indicative of elevated depressive symptoms compared to their peers.

72885,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of concern. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is classified as ""anxious"" with a Z-score of 0.46, and this measure shows a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with depressive symptoms. Concurrently, self-esteem is significantly low (Z-score -1.01), a factor that is strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptom severity (-0.71). Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor, with a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z-score 1.98), placing the participant in the ""Disturbed Sleep"" category and indicating substantial sleep difficulties. While self-reported current happiness is slightly above average (Z-score 0.55), its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46) suggests that lower happiness levels would be associated with increased depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.17), yet still shows a positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). Furthermore, the participant exhibits below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.53) and significantly low interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.42), both of which show negative correlations with depressive symptoms, implying that lower values in these areas are associated with higher depressive scores. Academically, the participant's GPA has shown a consistent decline over three academic semesters (3.19 to 2.77), which can be indicative of accumulating academic difficulties or reduced motivation.

Objective sleep and circadian rhythm data from wearable devices largely corroborate the self-reported sleep disturbances. The participant's median sleep duration is significantly short at 5 hours 59 minutes (Z-score -1.5). Sleep onset is notably late, with a median sleep start time of 03:43:59. While both sleep duration and sleep start time show average standard deviations (Z-scores -0.18 and -0.04 respectively), this indicates that the participant consistently experiences short and late sleep. The interdaily stability of the heart rate-derived circadian rhythm is significantly low (Z-score -1.32), reflecting poor regularity in daily activity patterns. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also low (Z-score -1.0), suggesting a blunted physiological response cycle over 24 hours. The acrophase, or peak of physiological activity, is observed relatively late at 6:38 PM. These objective metrics collectively suggest a significantly disrupted sleep schedule and an irregular, flattened circadian rhythm, which are common correlates of depressive symptomatology. Elevated mean heart rate deviation from the mesor during typical sleep hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score 2.04) suggests unusual physiological arousal at night, which aligns with late and short sleep. Conversely, hourly heart rate deviations are consistently below the mesor during much of the morning and early afternoon (e.g., 10-11 AM, Z-score -1.81; 12-1 PM, Z-score -1.54), indicating lower-than-average physiological activity during these times and potentially reflecting reduced daytime engagement or energy levels.

Behavioral patterns reveal a reliance on potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms and a general reduction in engagement with physical and social activities. Substance usage stands out, with recreational drug use reported ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 5.44) and non-prescribed drug use reported ""less than 1-2 times a month"" (Z-score 6.84), both representing extremely high frequencies relative to the study population. These behaviors show positive correlations with CES-D scores (0.16 and 0.17 respectively), suggesting their association with increased depressive symptoms. In contrast, physical activity levels are notably low; the participant reports exercising alone ""1-2 times a month"" (Z-score -0.43) and ""not at all"" for exercising with others (Z-score -1.58) or engaging in sports (Z-score -1.09). Reduced social exercise specifically shows a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23), indicating that lower engagement is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Among daily recreation habits, video game usage is significantly high at ""1-2 hours"" daily (Z-score 2.47), which, while not inherently negative, can contribute to sedentary behavior. Socializing with friends is below average (""31 minutes an hour,"" Z-score -0.62), suggesting limited social engagement, which is consistent with the lack of social exercise. This overall pattern of high substance use, low physical activity, and reduced social interaction points to behaviors that can exacerbate or co-occur with depressive states.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on a holistic analysis of the multimodal data, the participant exhibits a substantial burden of symptoms and behavioral patterns that are strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology.

Evidence strongly supporting a high CES-D score (top 50%):
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI Z=0.46, correlation 0.81):** A strong predictor and comorbidity of depression.
*   **Low Self-Esteem (RSES Z=-1.01, correlation -0.71):** A core symptom of depression.
*   **Severely Disturbed Subjective Sleep (PSQI Z=1.98):** A primary symptom often present in depression.
*   **Significantly Short Objective Sleep Duration (Fitbit Z=-1.5):** Objective confirmation of sleep deprivation.
*   **Disrupted Circadian Rhythm (Low Interdaily Stability Z=-1.32, Low Amplitude Z=-1.0):** Key physiological markers associated with depression.
*   **Nocturnal Physiological Arousal (Hourly HR 1-2 AM Z=2.04) and Blunted Daytime Activity (Hourly HR in morning/midday):** Consistent with sleep disturbance and reduced daytime energy/motivation.
*   **Extremely High Recreational and Non-prescribed Drug Use (Z=5.44 and Z=6.84 respectively, positive correlations):** Suggests significant distress and potentially maladaptive coping.
*   **Very Low Levels of Physical and Social Exercise (e.g., ""Exercised with Others"" Z=-1.58, negative correlation):** Indicators of social withdrawal and anhedonia.
*   **Declining GPA:** Suggests academic difficulties, concentration issues, or lack of motivation.
*   **Low Health Satisfaction (Z=-0.53, correlation -0.39) and Low Trust (Z=-1.42, correlation -0.41):** Additional psychological factors linked to depressive states.

Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%) is minimal:
*   Slightly below-average perceived stress (Z=-0.17) and slightly above-average current happiness (Z=0.55) are counter-indicators. However, the correlations between these variables and CES-D (0.28 and -0.46 respectively) indicate that if stress were higher or happiness lower, CES-D would be higher. Given the pervasive negative indicators, these isolated positive aspects do not outweigh the substantial evidence for elevated depressive symptoms.

The overwhelming evidence from self-report questionnaires, objective wearable data on sleep and circadian rhythms, and detailed behavioral habits strongly points to significant psychological distress and symptoms commonly associated with depression. The magnitude of deviations (high absolute Z-scores) in critical areas like sleep disturbance, substance use, and self-esteem, combined with their strong correlations with CES-D, indicates that the participant is likely experiencing an elevated burden of depressive symptoms compared to their peers.

71193,39.0,0.9818652849740933,"The participant’s psychological and behavioral profile, derived from self-reported surveys and wearable physiological data, presents a complex picture characterized by notable psychological distress alongside a robust, albeit shifted, physiological rhythm.

The self-report data indicates a significant burden of psychological distress. The participant reported high trait anxiety with a STAI score of 60, placing them 1.85 standard deviations above the mean for the study population and classified as ""anxious,"" a measure strongly correlated with CES-D (r = 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (Score 28, Z-score -1.43), indicating a significantly reduced sense of self-worth, which also correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71). Subjective happiness is also substantially below average (Current 2, Z-score -1.61, r = -0.45), while perceived stress is elevated (PSS Score 25, Z-score 0.92, r = 0.28). Furthermore, the participant reported low interpersonal trust (Score 2.5, Z-score -1.42, r = -0.4) and experienced subjectively poor sleep quality, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 8, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite objectively recorded sleep patterns. These self-reported psychological states collectively suggest a pervasive experience of internal struggle and emotional discomfort.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a tendency towards solitary and sedentary activities, with infrequent social engagement and physical exercise. Exercise frequency is low, reporting ""1-2 times a month"" for exercising alone (Z-score -0.43) and ""Not at all"" for exercising with others (Z-score -1.58) or sports (Z-score -1.09). Socializing with friends is also below average at ""31 minutes an hour"" (Z-score -0.62). Recreational habits include a significantly higher engagement in video games (""1-2 hours,"" Z-score 2.47) and other sedentary hobbies (""1-2 hours,"" Z-score 1.41), while abstaining from activities like watching TV/videos/movies and reading. These patterns suggest a preference for solitary leisure and a reduced level of engagement in activities that often involve social interaction or physical exertion.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian rhythm metrics present an interesting contrast to the subjective distress. Objectively, the participant records a high median sleep duration of 8 hours 2 minutes (Z-score 1.05) and exhibits remarkably consistent sleep patterns, with low standard deviations for both sleep duration (55 minutes, Z-score -1.04) and sleep start time (41 minutes, Z-score -0.93). The median sleep start time is late at 01:47:30, and there is a higher frequency of napping (0.19 naps/day, Z-score 1.34). Heart rate-derived circadian rhythms are exceptionally stable and well-defined, characterized by high Interdaily Stability (0.6, Z-score 1.57), low Intradaily Variability (0.37, Z-score -1.24), and strong Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.54, Z-score 1.82). The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also higher than average (13.74, Z-score 0.96), indicating clear daily fluctuations. The acrophase, or peak activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:49 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinctive pattern: significantly reduced physiological arousal in the mornings, with hourly mean heart rates dipping well below the mesor and closer to the resting heart rate (e.g., 8-9 AM: -22.88 from mesor, Z-score -1.81), followed by substantial peaks of elevated arousal in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 2-3 PM: 19.37 from mesor, Z-score 2.28; 3-4 PM: 20.03 from mesor, Z-score 2.01). This suggests a daily pattern of low morning physiological engagement followed by heightened activity later in the day, consistent with the late acrophase and the late sleep start time. The objective regularity of sleep and physiological rhythms stands in contrast to the participant's self-reported disturbed sleep and high psychological distress.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50% of the population) is compelling and pervasive throughout the self-reported psychological measures. The participant's STAI score (Z-score 1.85) is markedly elevated and strongly correlated with CES-D, indicating significant anxiety proneness. Similarly, their self-esteem (Z-score -1.43) is substantially low and highly negatively correlated with CES-D. Feelings of unhappiness (Z-score -1.61), elevated perceived stress (Z-score 0.92), and reduced interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.42) further coalesce to form a consistent profile of significant psychological distress, all of which align with higher depressive symptomatology and show relevant correlations with CES-D. Subjective disturbed sleep, as indicated by a PSQI score of 8, also points towards an elevated burden, despite objective sleep metrics. Behavioral patterns such as reduced social engagement (exercising with others, socializing with friends) and increased napping, which have negative and positive correlations with CES-D respectively, further support this interpretation.

Conversely, evidence that might suggest a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50% of the population) is primarily derived from objective wearable data, particularly concerning sleep regularity and circadian rhythm stability. The participant demonstrates objectively long sleep duration and remarkable consistency in both sleep duration and sleep start times, as well as a highly stable and robust heart rate-based circadian rhythm (high Interdaily Stability, low Intradaily Variability, high Autocorrelation). Disrupted circadian rhythms are well-established correlates of depression; thus, the stability observed here could be viewed as a protective factor. However, the correlations between these specific wearable metrics and CES-D are generally weak or even counter-intuitive in this dataset, and importantly, this objective regularity does not mitigate the participant's strong subjective reports of psychological distress and disturbed sleep.

Given the overwhelming and consistent evidence from multiple strongly correlated self-report psychological measures—particularly STAI, Self-Esteem, and Happiness—that indicate significant distress and align with characteristics of elevated depressive symptoms, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution. The objective physiological stability, while notable, is outweighed by the profound and direct indicators of subjective distress.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
98760,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by high subjective well-being, significant sleep disturbance, pronounced evening physiological arousal, and reduced social engagement. Self-reported psychological measures indicate a notably positive affective state; the participant reports lower trait anxiety than average (STAI Z-score -0.82), significantly higher self-esteem (RSES Z-score 0.82), and markedly elevated happiness levels (Z-score 1.64) compared to the study population. Perceived stress is also lower than average (PSS Z-score -0.71). These indicators, particularly anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness, show strong correlations with lower CES-D scores in the study population, suggesting a generally resilient psychological disposition. Academically, the participant maintains a high GPA, which may reflect effective coping mechanisms or overall functional capacity.

Despite the positive psychological self-reports, the participant exhibits clear signs of sleep disturbance. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) classifies their sleep as disturbed, indicating clinically significant difficulties. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours 52 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.39), and a relatively late median sleep start time of 01:58 AM. While sleep start time variability is slightly lower than average, suggesting some regularity, the overall pattern points to insufficient and subjectively poor-quality sleep. Furthermore, the participant reports slightly more daily naps than the average (Z-score 0.61), which can sometimes compensate for inadequate nighttime sleep or reflect daytime fatigue.

Analysis of circadian rhythms and physiological arousal reveals a distinct pattern of elevated cardiovascular activity during the evening hours. While the overall resting heart rate is lower than average (Z-score -0.61) and the heart rate mesor is slightly below average, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly higher (Z-score 1.64), suggesting robust physiological variation. However, the acrophase (peak physiological activity) is notably late at 6:32 PM, and hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor are profoundly elevated in the late evening and pre-sleep period. Specifically, mean heart rate deviations show extreme positive Z-scores between 8-9 PM (2.91), 10-11 PM (1.68), and 11-12 AM (2.28), indicating significantly higher physiological arousal during these hours compared to the study population. This objective physiological hyperarousal in the evening strongly corroborates the self-reported sleep disturbance and suggests difficulty unwinding and initiating sleep.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates a consistent avoidance of substance use, reporting 'Not at all' for all categories, with Z-scores indicating significantly lower usage than peers. Physical activity is notable for its solitary nature; the participant exercises alone frequently (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) but reports no exercise with others (Z-score -1.58) and no participation in sports (Z-score -1.09). A striking pattern of reduced social and recreational engagement is evident in daily habits: the participant spends significantly less time socializing with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41), uses the internet considerably less (15 minutes or less, Z-score -1.83), and engages less in activities like listening to music or reading compared to the study population. This preference for solitary activities and marked reduction in social interaction represents a salient behavioral pattern. Finally, self-reported health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53), which negatively correlates with CES-D scores.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**

A significant body of evidence from the participant's self-report surveys strongly points towards lower depressive symptomatology. The participant reports being ""not anxious"" on the STAI (Z-score -0.82), a measure with a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, meaning lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, their self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 0.82) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), further suggesting a lower depressive burden. Crucially, the participant reports significantly elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.71, correlation 0.28) and higher interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5, correlation -0.41) also align with a profile of lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant's complete abstinence from substance use and consistent high academic performance (GPA) suggest general well-being and functional capacity, which are often protective against elevated depressive symptoms. The very low internet usage (Z-score -1.83) also shows a positive correlation (0.25) with CES-D, implying that lower internet usage is associated with lower CES-D scores in the population.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**

Conversely, several key indicators suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptoms. The most compelling evidence comes from the participant's sleep profile. Their PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, a cardinal symptom frequently associated with depression. This subjective report is objectively reinforced by physiological data showing marked evening hyperarousal, with heart rate deviations from the mesor reaching exceptionally high positive Z-scores (e.g., 2.91 for 8-9 PM) during late evening and pre-sleep hours. Such persistent physiological activation during periods meant for rest can significantly contribute to overall distress and impaired functioning. Additionally, the participant's health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting that their lower satisfaction with health may be linked to higher depressive symptoms. A strong behavioral pattern of reduced social engagement is also observed, with significantly less time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) and less participation in group exercise or sports. While the population correlation between socializing with friends and CES-D is weak (-0.02) in this dataset, the magnitude of the social withdrawal in the individual remains a significant behavioral indicator often associated with depressive states, even if not strongly correlated with the CES-D in the overall population context.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The participant presents a complex and somewhat contradictory profile. There is compelling evidence from self-reported psychological states (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, stress) with strong correlations to the CES-D that would suggest a lower depressive symptom burden. These subjective well-being measures show substantial positive deviations from the population mean. However, these positive self-reports are juxtaposed against significant objective and subjective markers of distress, particularly related to sleep and social behavior. The clinically significant sleep disturbance, supported by physiological evidence of pronounced evening hyperarousal, is a critical indicator often associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Similarly, the extensive social withdrawal, while showing a weak population-level correlation with CES-D in this dataset, represents a substantial behavioral change that is a common feature of depressive experiences.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the highly positive self-reported affective states and self-perception, strongly aligned with lower CES-D scores through population correlations, suggest that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely not in the elevated range. While the sleep disturbance and social withdrawal are significant issues, the robust subjective well-being in core domains of mood, anxiety, and self-worth appears to buffer against a higher CES-D score in this case, especially given that the correlations for social engagement with CES-D are very weak in this population. Therefore, despite the challenges with sleep and social interaction, the participant's overall CES-D score is more likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
95374,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable anxiety and diminished subjective well-being despite several indicators of resilience. Self-report data reveal an anxious classification on the STAI-Trait scale (Score: 47.0, Z-score: 0.56), which is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81). Concurrently, the participant reports significantly lower current happiness (Score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), a factor moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.46), suggesting a higher depressive symptom burden. Counterbalancing these findings are a high self-esteem score (45.0, Z-score: 0.96) which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.71), lower perceived stress (Score: 19.0, Z-score: -0.71), and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Score: 4.89, Z-score: 0.47). This combination suggests an individual experiencing internal emotional distress in the form of anxiety and low happiness, despite maintaining a positive self-perception, lower general stress, and good health satisfaction.

A significant area of concern lies within the participant's sleep and circadian rhythm patterns, which appear markedly disrupted. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score: 1.05) classifies their sleep as disturbed. Objective wearable data corroborate this, showing average total sleep duration (7 hours 15 minutes, Z-score: 0.09) but exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 219 minutes, Z-score: 2.68) and highly irregular sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 148 minutes, Z-score: 1.43). The median sleep start time of 03:11:48 is notably late, compounded by a high frequency of daily napping (0.22 naps, Z-score: 1.75). Physiologically, the circadian rhythm analysis indicates a delayed acrophase at 7:41 PM, reflecting a later peak in daily physiological activity. This is further supported by hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor, showing significantly elevated cardiovascular activity during typical late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 7-8 PM, Z=3.42; 12-1 AM, Z=2.04; 2-3 AM, Z=2.30), followed by unusually low activity throughout the traditional morning period (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z=-2.20; 11-12 PM, Z=-2.53). This pronounced shift suggests a substantial misalignment of the participant's sleep-wake cycle and physiological arousal patterns, a common feature in individuals experiencing mood disturbances. While Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability are within the average range, a high amplitude (Z=2.06) suggests a robust but severely phase-delayed circadian signal.

Behavioral habits further illustrate an imbalance. The participant reports no engagement in exercise, neither alone (Z-score: -1.93) nor with others (Z-score: -1.58), and no participation in sports (Z-score: -1.09). This pronounced lack of physical activity is often associated with reduced mood and energy. Conversely, the participant abstains from all reported substance use categories, including alcohol and recreational drugs, indicating a healthy stance on substance consumption. Daily recreational habits lean towards sedentary activities, with above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score: 1.28) and notably high engagement in video games (1-2 hours, Z-score: 2.47). However, this is partially balanced by an above-average amount of time spent socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score: 1.74), suggesting a level of social engagement. The combination of minimal physical activity, high sedentary screen time, and significant sleep and circadian rhythm disruption indicates a lifestyle that may contribute to or exacerbate the observed psychological distress.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several protective factors and positive indicators. Their self-esteem is notably high (Z=0.96) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), suggesting resilience in self-worth. They report lower perceived stress (Z=-0.71) and above-average satisfaction with their physical health (Z=0.47), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D. Furthermore, the participant abstains from all reported substance use, representing a healthy lifestyle choice. Academically, a consistently high GPA (3.65-3.75) might also suggest a level of functioning and achievement that could mitigate depressive symptoms. Lastly, the participant engages in a higher-than-average amount of socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z=1.74), which is often a protective factor against depression.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Several salient features strongly suggest an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits an anxious classification on the STAI-Trait scale (Z=0.56), with a very strong positive correlation (0.81) to CES-D scores. Subjective happiness is reported as significantly low (Z=-1.61), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.46). Objectively, sleep quality is markedly disturbed (PSQI=9.0, Z=1.05), accompanied by extreme irregularity in both sleep duration (Z=2.68) and sleep start times (Z=1.43), and a significantly late median sleep start time (03:11:48). These sleep disturbances are highly characteristic of depression. Physiologically, a delayed acrophase (7:41 PM) and a highly unusual hourly heart rate pattern, showing elevated arousal late at night and suppressed activity in the morning, indicate significant circadian misalignment. Behaviorally, the complete absence of exercise across all categories (Z-scores below -1.09) is a major risk factor for depression, and high engagement in sedentary screen time (video games Z=2.47) could be either a symptom or a contributing factor to reduced activity and mood.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant benefits from high self-esteem, low perceived stress, good health satisfaction, and active social engagement, these protective factors appear to be significantly outweighed by the direct and indirect indicators of distress. The combination of self-reported high anxiety and low happiness, profound sleep disturbance, severe circadian rhythm misalignment (evidenced by the late acrophase and inverted physiological activity pattern), and a complete lack of physical exercise presents a robust profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The strong positive correlation of the STAI score with CES-D, coupled with the numerous objective and subjective markers of dysregulation, strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

71985,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile presents a nuanced picture, integrating self-reported perceptions with objective physiological and behavioral data.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant reports an average level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.03) and slightly above-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score 0.38). While self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55), their self-esteem is somewhat below the population mean (RSES Z-score -0.59). A particularly salient finding is a significantly below-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.2). These self-perceptions suggest a relatively stable but somewhat mixed affective state, with notable areas of concern in self-worth and health perception.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score of 5.0, Z-score -0.8), placing them better than average within the study population. Objective wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 18 minutes, which is average, with typical variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.17) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.35). Furthermore, their heart rate-based circadian rhythms exhibit high regularity and structure, characterized by a very high interdaily stability (Z-score 2.07) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.74). The mesor of their heart rate is below average (Z-score -1.04), while the amplitude of their daily heart rate variation is above average (Z-score 1.01), with the acrophase occurring at 4:37 PM. These metrics collectively point to a robust and well-entrained physiological rhythm.

Physiologically, the participant displays a low resting heart rate of 50 bpm (Z-score -0.97), suggesting good cardiovascular health. Their aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear diurnal pattern of physiological activity. Heart rate is substantially below the mesor during the early morning hours, reaching its nadir around 5-6 AM (24.87 bpm below mesor, Z-score -0.95). Conversely, periods of elevated heart rate, indicative of higher physiological arousal or activity, are observed during the early afternoon (e.g., 1-2 PM, 19.03 bpm above mesor, Z-score 1.88) and early evening (e.g., 7-8 PM, 20.09 bpm above mesor, Z-score 1.50). This distinct fluctuation from low nocturnal activity to elevated daytime peaks is consistent with their strong circadian rhythm metrics.

In terms of lifestyle, the participant reports complete abstinence from all surveyed substances (alcohol, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs), placing their usage significantly below the population mean. They engage in above-average solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07), while social exercise and sports participation are at typical levels. Their recreational habits are notably characterized by significantly higher engagement in video games (1-2 hours daily, Z-score 2.47) and above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85). Socializing and reading habits align with population averages. This behavioral pattern highlights a preference for solitary physical activity alongside a substantial commitment to screen-based sedentary leisure.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

To assess the participant's likely CES-D score relative to the study population, evidence for both low/median (bottom 50%, i.e., score <= 11.0) and high (top 50%, i.e., score > 11.0) depressive symptomatology is considered. The population median CES-D score is 11.0.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score:**
The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55, correlating -0.46 with CES-D) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5, correlating -0.41 with CES-D), both of which are moderately associated with lower CES-D scores. Their self-reported sleep quality is good (PSQI Z-score -0.8), typically correlating with lower depressive symptoms. Objective measures indicate a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 2.07, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 1.74), which is generally linked to better mental health. Furthermore, regular solitary exercise (Z-score 1.07) and complete abstinence from substance use are generally considered protective factors against depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score:**
The participant's self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.59) and exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is highly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Critically, their satisfaction with physical health is significantly below average (Z-score -1.2), also showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39). While trait anxiety is average (Z-score -0.03), its very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) means that even an average level of anxiety can contribute meaningfully to a higher depressive symptom burden. Slightly above-average perceived stress (Z-score 0.38) also weakly aligns with higher CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a mixed profile. While several factors, such as good subjective sleep, above-average happiness and trust, robust circadian rhythms, regular exercise, and abstinence from substance use, suggest a foundation of well-being, several key indicators strongly point towards an elevated CES-D score. The significantly low self-esteem, with its strong negative correlation to CES-D, and the markedly low health satisfaction, with its moderate negative correlation, are particularly impactful. These factors, alongside an average but strongly correlated anxiety score, collectively outweigh the protective effects of other variables, especially those with weaker or negligible correlations to CES-D. Therefore, considering the magnitude of the Z-scores and the strength of the correlations for self-esteem and health satisfaction, the evidence suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would likely place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
43125,37.0,0.9715025906735751,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates elevated levels of chronic anxiety and lower self-esteem relative to the study population. Their STAI-Trait score places them at 1.16 standard deviations above the mean, classifying them as ""anxious,"" a characteristic that shows a strong positive correlation (r=0.81) with depressive symptoms. Concurrently, their self-esteem score is 0.73 standard deviations below the mean, which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.71), suggesting an association with higher depressive symptomatology. Self-reported happiness is also below average (Z=-0.53), consistent with lower mood. While perceived stress levels are slightly below average (Z=-0.44), this appears somewhat incongruous with the high anxiety and low happiness reported elsewhere, although it does correlate positively with CES-D (r=0.29). Satisfaction with physical health is also notably lower than average (Z=-0.70).

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits significant sleep disturbances, as evidenced by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (Z=1.52) indicating clinically significant poor sleep quality. This subjective report is complemented by wearable data showing a median sleep start time of 2:00 AM, indicative of a substantial circadian phase delay. Despite this late onset, the participant maintains an average sleep duration of 7 hours 28 minutes and shows below-average variability in both sleep duration and start time, suggesting a consistent, albeit delayed, sleep schedule. However, an elevated frequency of daily naps (Z=0.82) suggests compensatory sleep behaviors or persistent daytime sleepiness, which is positively correlated with CES-D. Lifestyle habits also reveal concerning patterns: extremely high recreational drug use (Z=5.44) and elevated alcohol consumption are reported, potentially serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms. Physical activity is notably absent, with all forms of exercise (alone, with others, sports) reported as ""Not at all"" and corresponding low Z-scores, a pattern consistently associated with higher depressive symptoms. Leisure activities lean heavily towards solitary, screen-based engagement, with higher-than-average time spent watching TV/videos (Z=1.28), playing video games (Z=1.71), and using the internet (Z=0.85), while time spent socializing with friends is below average (Z=-0.62).

Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate monitoring further illuminate a disrupted activity and sleep-wake cycle. The participant's hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a distinctive pattern of elevated physiological arousal extending late into the night (12-2 AM; Z-scores 1.67, 1.53) and persisting into the late evening (7-11 PM; Z-scores ranging from 1.34 to 1.71). Conversely, heart rate drops significantly below the mesor in the pre-dawn hours, but activity remains notably low into the late morning (9-10 AM; Z=-2.30), indicating a delayed initiation of daily activity. A sharp increase in heart rate then occurs around late morning/noon (11 AM-1 PM; Z-scores 1.85, 1.01), suggesting a compensatory burst of activity. Overall, the individual's mesor (mean heart rate) is higher than average (Z=0.62), positively correlating with CES-D, which may reflect a generally elevated physiological state. While the circadian amplitude is robust (Z=1.36), suggesting a strong physiological response range, its negative correlation with CES-D indicates that, typically, higher amplitude is associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, the *timing* of this robust rhythm is evidently delayed, consistent with the observed sleep patterns.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Their STAI-Trait score, indicating ""anxious"" classification (Z=1.16), is highly correlated with CES-D (r=0.81). Similarly, their lower self-esteem (Z=-0.73) shows a strong negative correlation (r=-0.71) with CES-D, meaning lower self-esteem is linked to higher depressive symptoms. The PSQI score (Z=1.52) signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance, a common symptom of depression. Furthermore, observed behavioral patterns, such as extremely high recreational drug use (Z=5.44), very low engagement in physical exercise (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93), and lower self-reported happiness (Z=-0.53), are frequently linked to increased depressive symptom burden. Physiologically, the pronounced circadian phase delay, characterized by a median sleep start time of 2:00 AM, elevated nightly heart rates, and delayed daytime activity initiation, points to significant disruptions in the sleep-wake cycle and daily rhythm, which are robustly associated with mood disorders. The overall higher mesor heart rate (Z=0.62) also positively correlates with CES-D.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50%):**
Fewer strong indicators suggest a lower depressive symptom burden. The participant reported slightly lower-than-average perceived stress (Z=-0.44), which, given its positive correlation (r=0.29) with CES-D, might suggest lower depressive symptoms. Their resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z=-0.4), and with a positive correlation (r=0.20) to CES-D, this would lean towards lower symptomatology. Additionally, the participant demonstrates relatively consistent sleep patterns, with below-average variability in sleep duration (Z=-0.66) and start time (Z=-0.82). Although the *timing* is highly delayed, this consistency, when correlated positively with CES-D, implies that lower variability is associated with lower CES-D. A robust heart rate circadian amplitude (Z=1.36) is also present, which, given its negative correlation (r=-0.11) with CES-D, might suggest aspects of physiological resilience.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite some indicators that might suggest a lower depressive symptom burden (e.g., lower perceived stress, lower RHR, consistent but late sleep schedule), the cumulative weight of evidence strongly points towards elevated depressive symptomatology. The high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, clinically significant sleep disturbance, significant substance use, and severe lack of physical activity are all powerful and well-established correlates of depression. The pronounced physiological and behavioral circadian phase delay further contributes to this picture of distress and dysregulation. The strong correlations of STAI (0.81) and Self-Esteem (-0.71) with CES-D, in particular, are highly influential in this assessment. Therefore, based on the multimodal data, it is most probable that this participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
98117,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological state suggests significant affective distress and compromised self-perception. Their STAI score of 53.0 (Z-score 1.16) indicates elevated anxiety proneness, a finding strongly correlated with higher depressive symptom burden (correlation 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low, with a score of 32.0 (Z-score -0.87), which bears a substantial negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71). Subjective happiness is also markedly low, reported at 2.0 (Z-score -1.61), with a moderate negative correlation to depressive symptoms (-0.46). Furthermore, the participant reports very low interpersonal trust (score 2.17, Z-score -2.07), a trait moderately associated with higher CES-D scores (-0.40), and lower overall satisfaction with physical health (score 3.0, Z-score -0.95), also moderately correlated with depressive symptoms (-0.39). Perceived stress is near the population average (score 22.0, Z-score 0.1), with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. Notably, the participant reports no substance use, which is a positive health behavior, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

Behaviorally, the data reveals pronounced social withdrawal and a highly sedentary lifestyle. The participant reports not engaging in any form of exercise (all Z-scores below -1.0), which is a common behavioral pattern associated with depressive states. Critically, socializing with friends is reported at ""15 minutes or less"" daily (Z-score -2.2), indicating an extreme lack of social engagement, a strong indicator of social anhedonia or withdrawal. In contrast, engagement in solitary and screen-based activities is elevated; the participant spends 2-3 hours watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.91), 31 minutes per hour playing video games (Z-score 1.71), and more than 4 hours using the internet daily (Z-score 2.19). While these activities show only weak positive correlations with CES-D, their prominence alongside social isolation reinforces a pattern of disengagement from social and physical activities.

Sleep patterns are profoundly disrupted according to both self-report and wearable data. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) signifies clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance. Objective Fitbit data further underscores severe sleep dysregulation: the median sleep duration is 6 hours 37 minutes (Z-score -0.71), indicating insufficient sleep. More critically, the variability in sleep is extreme, with a sleep duration standard deviation of 234 minutes (Z-score 3.02) and a sleep start time standard deviation of 280 minutes (Z-score 4.33). Both of these metrics exhibit extremely high variability relative to the population and are positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.17 and 0.19, respectively). The median sleep start time of 04:03:17 (4:03 AM) indicates a severely delayed and erratic sleep-wake schedule. This combination of short, highly variable, and extremely late sleep onset points to a significant disturbance in the participant's sleep-wake cycle, a hallmark of depressive symptomatology.

Physiological markers from wearable data present a picture of elevated baseline arousal and a somewhat blunted and delayed circadian rhythm. The participant's resting heart rate (66.4 bpm, Z-score 0.98) and Mesor (80.99 bpm, Z-score 0.96) are elevated, suggesting a generally higher physiological baseline, with weak positive correlations to CES-D (0.19 for both). The circadian rhythm exhibits an average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.08) but a notably low intraday variability (Z-score -1.73), indicating less dynamic physiological fluctuation throughout the day. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is slightly below average (Z-score -0.42), suggesting a somewhat blunted physiological response to the day-night cycle. The acrophase, representing the peak of cardiovascular activity, is recorded at 6:27 PM, which is a delayed peak, consistent with the very late sleep start time and indicative of a desynchronized internal clock. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a deep trough in the early morning hours (e.g., -16.19 at 6-7 AM) and a late afternoon/early evening peak (e.g., 14.24 at 5-6 PM), further illustrating the delayed and somewhat flattened rhythm.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as indicated by a confluence of self-report and physiological data, would place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50th Percentile):**
*   **Affective Symptoms:** The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.16, correlation 0.81), very low self-esteem (Z-score -0.87, correlation -0.71), and very low current happiness (Z-score -1.61, correlation -0.46). These are direct, strongly correlated indicators of elevated depressive symptomatology.
*   **Social Withdrawal:** Extremely low engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score -2.2) is a critical behavioral indicator of social withdrawal, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Sleep Dysregulation:** Both self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score 8.0) and objective wearable data reveal severe sleep problems. The extremely high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 3.02, correlation 0.17) and sleep start time (Z-score 4.33, correlation 0.19), coupled with an extremely late median sleep start time (4:03 AM), are robust markers of highly irregular and disrupted sleep-wake cycles frequently associated with depression.
*   **Other Psychological Factors:** Very low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.07, correlation -0.4) and lower health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95, correlation -0.39) further contribute to a general picture of psychological distress.
*   **Sedentary Lifestyle:** The complete lack of reported exercise (all Z-scores significantly negative) and high engagement in solitary, screen-based activities are behaviors commonly observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
*   Some metrics like perceived stress (Z-score 0.1) are near the population average, and substance usage is non-existent.
*   Certain circadian rhythm metrics like Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.08) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.06) are within the average range. Intradaily variability is low (Z-score -1.73), which could be interpreted as blunted physiological responsiveness, but its correlation with CES-D is weakly negative (-0.04), not supporting a higher score.
*   Elevated resting heart rate and Mesor have only weak positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting they may not be the primary drivers of depressive symptom burden in this participant.

**Holistic Analysis:** The strong and consistent evidence from self-reported affective states (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness), profound social withdrawal, and severe objective sleep dysregulation (irregularity in timing and duration) strongly outweigh the few average or weakly correlated metrics. The extreme Z-scores for social engagement and sleep variability are particularly compelling and indicative of a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. Therefore, the overall picture points to a CES-D score falling into the higher end of the distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
24883,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"The participant's psychological and behavioral profile reveals a complex interplay of strengths and challenges, with notable patterns observed across self-reported surveys and wearable-derived metrics.

The participant reports average levels of trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.07) and slightly above-average perceived stress (PSS Z=0.38). Notably, they exhibit higher-than-average self-esteem (RSES Z=1.52), which is generally considered a significant protective psychological factor. However, this is contrasted by lower-than-average self-reported current happiness (Z=-0.53), diminished satisfaction with physical health (Z=-0.7), and reduced interpersonal trust (Z=-1.1). The convergence of lower happiness, health satisfaction, and trust, coupled with elevated stress, suggests an affective state that may be associated with increased depressive symptomatology, despite the resilience indicated by high self-esteem.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pronounced reduction in social and recreational engagement. They report ""not at all"" for exercising with others (Z=-1.58) and sports participation (Z=-1.09), and considerably lower-than-average time spent socializing with friends (Z=-1.41). While engagement in individual exercise is average, the overall pattern indicates significant social withdrawal. Furthermore, participation in diverse recreational activities such as reading, video games, and sedentary hobbies is also reported as ""do not do"" or at low frequencies. This generalized reduction in engagement, particularly in social contexts, aligns with behavioral patterns commonly observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. Concurrent with this, the participant reports above-average consumption of beer (Z=1.01) and wine/liquor (Z=0.94). Despite these challenges, the participant maintains a high GPA, suggesting a degree of preserved academic functioning.

Sleep patterns and circadian rhythm regulation represent a critical area of concern. The participant self-reports ""Disturbed Sleep,"" indicated by a PSQI score of 6. Objective wearable data corroborates and expands on this, revealing an exceptionally late median sleep start time of 3:00 AM. This significantly delayed sleep phase is accompanied by physiological markers of nocturnal arousal; hourly heart rate data shows significantly elevated mean heart rate deviations from the mesor during the 12 AM to 3 AM period (Z-scores of 1.95, 2.36, and 2.82, respectively), indicative of heightened cardiovascular activity during hours typically dedicated to deep sleep. This pattern strongly suggests profound sleep disruption and physiological activation during the night. Further analysis of circadian rhythm metrics indicates a blunted and less robust physiological rhythm, characterized by lower-than-average Interdaily Stability (Z=-0.99), Intradaily Variability (Z=-1.31), and a reduced Amplitude (Z=-1.11). The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurring at 7:01 PM, further supports a significant phase delay or disruption in the participant's daily physiological rhythm, which likely contributes to their difficulties in establishing and maintaining a regular sleep schedule.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):
*   The most significant protective factor is the participant's high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.52), which has a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, indicating that higher self-esteem is typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology.
*   Trait anxiety (STAI) is at an average level (Z-score = 0.07), which, despite its strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), does not suggest elevated anxiety as a contributing factor to a high CES-D score in this individual.
*   Resting heart rate (Z-score = -0.71) is below average, generally indicative of better physiological health.

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50%):
*   The participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 6), which is a common symptom of depression. This is supported by objective data showing a remarkably late median sleep start time (3:00 AM) and significant physiological arousal (elevated heart rate) during typical sleep hours (12 AM-3 AM).
*   Circadian rhythm analysis reveals a blunted and less stable rhythm, with low Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -0.99), low Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -1.31), and low Amplitude (Z-score = -1.11), patterns often associated with mood disturbances.
*   Significant behavioral withdrawal is evident, with very low engagement in social exercise (Z-score = -1.58), sports (Z-score = -1.09), and socializing with friends (Z-score = -1.41).
*   The participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53), lower health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.7), and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score = -1.1), all of which correlate negatively with CES-D, meaning lower scores on these metrics are associated with higher CES-D.
*   Perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.38), which correlates positively with CES-D.
*   Elevated alcohol consumption (beer Z-score = 1.01, wine/liquor Z-score = 0.94) may also be a coping mechanism.

Holistic Analysis:
While the participant benefits from high self-esteem and average trait anxiety, the extensive evidence for sleep and circadian rhythm dysregulation, coupled with pervasive social and recreational withdrawal, points strongly towards a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The objectively measured physiological arousal during sleep and the profound disruption to the sleep-wake cycle are particularly compelling indicators. These severe behavioral and physiological disturbances, along with negative self-reported affect and social factors, outweigh the protective effect of high self-esteem. Therefore, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by above-average self-esteem, high interpersonal trust, and elevated self-reported happiness. Specifically, their self-esteem score (Z=0.54) is higher than the population average, a factor strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores (correlation = -0.71). Similarly, high scores in trust (Z=1.47) and happiness (Z=1.64) are also moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (correlations = -0.41 and -0.46, respectively), suggesting these traits may serve as protective factors against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress (Z=0.1) and trait anxiety (Z=-0.03) levels are within the average range for the study population, indicating typical experiences of these states. The participant also reports average satisfaction with their physical health (Z=-0.2).

Sleep patterns, derived from both self-report and wearable data, generally indicate good quality and consistency. The participant reports ""Good Sleep"" with a PSQI Z-score of -0.8, suggesting better subjective sleep quality than the average student. Objective sleep statistics from wearable devices support this, showing an average median sleep duration of 7 hours 6 minutes (Z=-0.11) and notably low variability in sleep duration from night to night (standard deviation of 40 minutes, Z=-1.38). While the median sleep start time is relatively late at 01:49:00, the consistency in this timing is average (standard deviation of 56 minutes, Z=-0.6). The participant reports no daily naps (Z=-0.86), further indicating a consistent nocturnal sleep routine.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates low engagement in substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for beer, wine or liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low negative Z-scores. Exercise habits reveal a preference for social activity, with high frequency of exercising with others (three times a week or more, Z=1.23) contrasting with infrequent solitary exercise (Z=-1.18). Engagement in various daily recreational activities appears to be considerably lower than the population average, with particularly low reported times for watching TV/videos/movies (Z=-1.25), internet usage (Z=-1.16), listening to music (Z=-1.19), and socializing with friends (Z=-1.41). Despite the low engagement in these activities, their individual correlations with CES-D scores are generally low, with some indicating that less engagement is associated with lower CES-D for those specific activities (e.g., internet usage, listening to music).

Physiological data from wearables highlights robust cardiovascular health and distinct circadian rhythms. The participant exhibits an exceptionally low resting heart rate of 45.8 bpm (Z=-1.47) and a low overall mean heart rate (Mesor = 64.28, Z=-1.32), consistent with a high level of cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm analysis indicates a high amplitude in heart rate variation (Z=1.64), signifying a pronounced difference between peak activity and rest periods. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, is noted at 5:29 PM. The interdaily stability (Z=0.83) is above average, suggesting good regularity in the daily rhythm of heart rate. Hourly deviations from the Mesor illustrate a strong diurnal pattern: heart rate is significantly suppressed during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -28.06 bpm between 4-5 AM, Z=-1.65) and shows substantial peaks in the late afternoon and evening. Notably, the 5-6 PM hour registers an extremely high deviation (+38.42 bpm, Z=4.07), and 9-10 PM also shows a very high deviation (+25.2 bpm, Z=3.01), implying periods of vigorous physiological activity or arousal during these times.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant presents a strong profile of psychological traits negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Their self-esteem is above average (Z=0.54) and demonstrates a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). Similarly, high levels of trust (Z=1.47) and self-reported happiness (Z=1.64) are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41 and -0.46, respectively). The participant's self-reported sleep quality is good (PSQI Z=-0.8), and objective sleep metrics show average duration with remarkably high consistency in duration (Z=-1.38). Physical health indicators, such as a very low resting heart rate (Z=-1.47) and a low overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z=-1.32), suggest excellent cardiovascular fitness. Furthermore, engagement in social exercise is high (Z=1.23), which can be a protective factor. Average scores for perceived stress and trait anxiety indicate these are not elevated risk factors for this individual.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
There is limited direct evidence to suggest a high CES-D score for this participant. While the participant reports significantly lower engagement in several daily recreational activities (e.g., socializing with friends Z=-1.41, watching TV Z=-1.25), the correlations provided between these activities and CES-D scores are generally low or negligible for this study population. In several instances (e.g., Internet Usage, Listening to Music), lower engagement is even weakly associated with a lower CES-D score. The high positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D (0.81) would suggest that high anxiety could lead to a high CES-D score, but this participant's anxiety level is average (Z=-0.03), therefore this factor does not contribute to an elevated CES-D score in this case.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores. The combined strength of elevated self-esteem, trust, and happiness, which are all strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D, strongly points towards a lower symptom burden. These protective psychological factors, alongside good sleep quality and consistency, robust physiological health markers, and average levels of stress and anxiety, outweigh any potential, but weakly correlated, implications of low engagement in general recreational activities.

The participant exhibits a generally favorable psychological profile across several self-reported measures. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low with a Z-score of -1.02, indicating significantly lower anxiety proneness compared to the study population. This finding is particularly salient given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI scores and CES-D, suggesting a reduced likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Complementing this, the participant reports very high self-esteem (Z-score 1.52) and elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64), both of which are strongly or moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (0.71 and 0.46, respectively). Perceived stress is also low (Z-score -0.71), aligning with a weak positive correlation to CES-D. Additionally, satisfaction with physical health is high (Z-score 1.38), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, further supporting a robust sense of well-being.

Sleep patterns appear to be consistently regulated and subjectively good. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) classifies the participant's sleep as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.8, indicating better subjective sleep quality than the average participant. This is supported by objective wearable data showing an above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 26 minutes (Z-score 0.32). Furthermore, the participant demonstrates remarkably consistent sleep habits, with low standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score -0.94) and sleep start times (Z-score -0.79). The absence of daily napping (Z-score -0.86) also points to a consolidated main sleep period, reinforcing the picture of a stable and healthy sleep architecture.

In terms of daily behaviors, the participant engages in moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for both beer and wine/liquor), with both showing Z-scores above 0, indicating slightly higher than average use, though these activities have negligible correlations with CES-D. A very prominent behavioral aspect is the extremely high frequency of recreational drug usage (1-2 times a week), evidenced by a striking Z-score of 5.44. While this is an extreme outlier, its correlation with CES-D is notably weak (0.18). Exercise frequency is generally average to slightly below average, with Z-scores for exercising with others and playing sports being slightly negative. The participant spends a significant amount of time engaged in social activities (more than 4 hours daily, Z-score 2.53) and listening to music (more than 4 hours daily, Z-score 2.06), both considerably higher than the population mean. Internet usage is also high (3-4 hours daily, Z-score 1.52).

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors reveal a heart rate profile characterized by a slightly lower average heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.86) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.51) compared to the study population. However, the participant exhibits elevated Intradaily Variability (Z-score 1.3), suggesting less consistency in heart rate patterns within a single day, despite stable sleep timing. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor highlights significant physiological arousal in the late evening and early night, specifically between 10 PM and 1 AM, with Z-scores reaching up to 1.65. This pattern indicates an elevated heart rate during hours typically associated with winding down for sleep, which could suggest delayed activity or arousal. A similar, though less pronounced, elevation is also observed around midday (12-1 PM). Despite these fluctuations, the correlations of these hourly deviations with CES-D are generally weak to negligible.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Based on the comprehensive multimodal analysis, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence stems from the self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.02), which has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, directly indicating lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, very high self-esteem (Z-score 1.52) and elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64), both with moderate to strong negative correlations (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively) to CES-D, robustly point towards lower depressive symptomatology. Further supporting this, perceived stress is low (Z-score -0.71), and health satisfaction is high (Z-score 1.38), both of which are favorably correlated with lower CES-D scores. Objective and subjective sleep data also indicate good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) and highly consistent sleep duration and start times (low standard deviations, Z-scores -0.94 and -0.79), factors generally associated with better mental health and lower depressive risk. The participant's high level of socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53) is also a protective behavioral factor, even with a negligible correlation.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
While some behavioral patterns are notable, their direct association with elevated CES-D is weak based on the provided correlations. The extremely high frequency of recreational drug usage (Z-score 5.44) is a significant outlier, but its correlation with CES-D is only 0.18, indicating a very weak link to higher depressive symptoms in this dataset. Similarly, high internet usage (Z-score 1.52) and extensive music listening (Z-score 2.06) show only weak positive correlations with CES-D (0.26 for both). Elevated intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score 1.3) could suggest less stable physiological regulation, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.05). The observed late-evening physiological arousal (high hourly HR deviations) is a physiological pattern of interest, but its correlations with CES-D are also negligible. Therefore, while these patterns might indicate other challenges or unique behaviors, they do not strongly support a higher CES-D score based on the provided correlational data.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The cumulative weight of evidence from core psychological well-being indicators (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, stress) and consistent, good sleep patterns strongly points towards a profile inconsistent with elevated depressive symptoms. The significant deviations observed in recreational drug use and late-evening physiological arousal, while noteworthy, do not have sufficiently strong positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset to outweigh the robust indicators of low depressive symptom burden. Given the pronounced strengths in areas highly correlated with lower CES-D scores, the participant's CES-D score is most likely in the bottom 50% of the study population.

14847,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with notable difficulties in sleep and significant irregularities in physiological rhythms. Self-report data indicate a ""anxious"" classification on the STAI-Trait scale (Score: 50.0, Z-score: 0.86), a measure strongly correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). This is accompanied by an elevated score on the Perceived Stress Scale (Score: 24.0, Z-score: 0.65), also positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.28). Further contributing to psychological distress are moderately lower self-esteem (Score: 35.0, Z-score: -0.45), which is strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=-0.71), and a remarkably low degree of interpersonal trust (Score: 1.67, Z-score: -3.03), a factor moderately negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=-0.41). While the participant reports slightly above-average current happiness (Z-score: 0.55) and high health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.97), these aspects appear alongside a significant burden of anxiety, stress, and impaired social cognition, suggesting a potential disconnect between situational well-being and underlying trait vulnerabilities.

Sleep patterns for this participant are markedly disturbed, as indicated by both self-report and wearable data. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score: 1.52) classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" Objective Fitbit data corroborates this, showing a below-average median sleep duration of 6 hours 38 minutes (Z-score: -0.69) and a late median sleep start time of 02:24 AM. Furthermore, sleep is characterized by significant inconsistency, with an elevated standard deviation in sleep duration (134 minutes, Z-score: 0.75) and sleep start time (104 minutes, Z-score: 0.46), both of which are positively correlated with depressive symptoms. The participant also engages in significantly more daily napping than average (Mean Daily Naps: 0.24, Z-score: 1.9), a behavior often indicative of compensatory sleep attempts due to insufficient or poor-quality nighttime sleep, and positively correlated with depressive symptoms.

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms reveals a fragmented and somewhat delayed physiological pattern. The participant exhibits significantly high intradaily variability (0.83, Z-score: 2.01), suggesting a highly fragmented and irregular pattern of activity and rest throughout the day. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.35, Z-score: -0.49), indicating some day-to-day inconsistency. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late at 5:43 PM, which aligns with a general pattern of delayed activity. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor (mean heart rate) show typical dips during early morning sleep hours but also prolonged periods of elevated heart rate into the late evening (7-10 PM), consistent with a later activity cycle. This combination of fragmentation and a delayed phase suggests a dysregulated circadian system that may contribute to or be exacerbated by sleep disturbances.

Behavioral patterns present a mixed picture. The participant reports significantly above-average recreational drug usage (Z-score: 1.61), a behavior positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.15), while alcohol use is below average. Exercise habits are predominantly solitary, with above-average frequency of exercising alone (Z-score: 1.07) but significantly low engagement in exercising with others (Z-score: -1.58) or sports (Z-score: -1.09). Daily recreation habits include elevated time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: 1.28) and listening to music (Z-score: 1.13), both of which are positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.12 and r=0.25, respectively). Engagement in a sedentary hobby is also elevated (Z-score: 0.82), with a positive correlation to CES-D (r=0.11). Interestingly, time spent socializing with friends is reported as above average (Z-score: 0.95), suggesting social engagement, albeit possibly not in active group settings. The overall pattern suggests a preference for solitary and sedentary activities, alongside concerning recreational drug use, which may either reflect or contribute to depressive symptomatology.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the top 50% of the study population. The participant's STAI-Trait score (Z=0.86, ""anxious"" classification) exhibits a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81), indicating a high likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Poor self-esteem (Z=-0.45) is also strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71), aligning with a higher symptom burden. The participant's extremely low score on interpersonal trust (Z=-3.03), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.41), further points towards a psychological profile associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Significant sleep disturbance is evident, with a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z=1.52) indicating clinically significant poor sleep quality, a hallmark feature of depression. Objective sleep metrics reinforce this, showing below-average sleep duration and, crucially, high variability in both sleep duration (Z=0.75, r=0.19) and sleep start time (Z=0.46, r=0.21), alongside significantly increased daily napping (Z=1.9, r=0.2). All these sleep disturbances are positively correlated with higher CES-D scores in the study population. Physiologically, the highly fragmented heart rate-based circadian rhythm, evidenced by a significantly elevated Intradaily Variability (Z=2.01), and a slightly reduced circadian amplitude (Z=-0.41, r=-0.1), are indicators of physiological dysregulation commonly observed in individuals with mood disturbances. Furthermore, elevated perceived stress (Z=0.65, r=0.28) and significantly high recreational drug usage (Z=1.61, r=0.15) are behavioral patterns positively correlated with higher CES-D scores. Finally, elevated engagement in sedentary activities like watching TV/videos (Z=1.28, r=0.12) and listening to music (Z=1.13, r=0.25) also correlate positively with depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

Some self-reported data points offer counter-evidence, suggesting potentially lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports slightly above-average current happiness (Z=0.55), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46), and high satisfaction with their health (Z=0.97), also negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.4). Additionally, the participant engages in above-average solitary exercise (Z=1.07), a behavior weakly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.09). Their alcohol consumption is below average, with very low correlations to CES-D. However, these positive indicators are generally outweighed by the more pervasive and strongly correlated markers of distress.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that the participant likely has a CES-D score in the top half of the study population distribution. While self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are positive, they are overshadowed by multiple robust indicators of psychological distress, severe sleep disturbance, and physiological dysregulation. The high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, extremely low trust, disturbed and inconsistent sleep, fragmented circadian rhythms, elevated perceived stress, and concerning recreational drug use, many with strong correlations to CES-D, collectively paint a picture consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The contradictions (e.g., happiness, health satisfaction) might reflect an individual's coping mechanisms or a disconnect between specific domains of well-being and underlying mental health challenges. Given the cumulative and highly intercorrelated nature of these findings with depressive symptoms, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score would fall into the top 50th percentile.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
43382,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"The analysis of the participant's multimodal data reveals a complex interplay of psychological traits, behavioral habits, and physiological markers, some suggesting resilience and others indicating vulnerabilities associated with depressive symptoms.

**Psychological and Emotional Profile:**
The participant exhibits a mixed psychological profile, characterized by both protective factors and significant vulnerabilities. Self-reported happiness is notably high (Z-score 1.64), which demonstrates a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.47), suggesting a buffer against depressive symptoms. Similarly, perceived stress is significantly low (Z-score -0.98), correlating positively with CES-D (0.29), further indicating a reduced burden of depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score 1.22), showing a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.4), aligning with lower depressive symptom risk. In contrast, the participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 46.0, Z-score 0.46), classified as 'anxious', which has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.82), indicating a significant predisposition to experience depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is below the population average (Z-score -0.87), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.71), aligning with a higher depressive symptom burden. Interpersonal trust is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.46), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.41), further pointing towards a tendency for higher depressive symptoms. This presents a nuanced picture where conscious self-perceptions of happiness and low stress appear to coexist with underlying trait anxieties and lower self-esteem, which are robustly linked to depression.

**Behavioral Habits and Lifestyle:**
Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates very low engagement in physical exercise, reporting ""Not at all"" for exercising alone, with others, or participating in sports, with corresponding Z-scores significantly below the population mean (-1.93 to -1.09). Lack of physical activity is a well-established factor broadly associated with increased depressive symptoms. Socializing with friends is also reported at lower levels (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score -1.41), which typically correlates with higher depressive symptoms. Substance usage, including alcohol and recreational drugs, is notably low or absent across all categories, indicating a generally healthy approach to these behaviors. Recreational screen time, such as watching TV/videos, is average, while internet usage is notably low (15 minutes or less, Z-score -1.83). Interestingly, in this study population, both lower internet usage (correlation 0.26) and lower music listening (correlation 0.25) are associated with lower CES-D scores. Engagement in sedentary hobbies is also reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score -0.96), which, with its positive correlation (0.12), might imply lower depressive symptoms for this individual.

**Sleep Patterns:**
The participant's sleep architecture exhibits several characteristics often associated with higher depressive symptoms. Median sleep duration is relatively short at 6 hours 10 minutes, placing the participant significantly below the population average (Z-score -1.27). Furthermore, there is considerable variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 120 minutes, Z-score 0.44) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 101 minutes, Z-score 0.39). Both higher variability in sleep duration and sleep start time show positive correlations with CES-D scores (0.20 and 0.21 respectively). These combined metrics suggest an irregular and insufficient sleep schedule that is frequently observed alongside or contributes to depressive symptomology, despite the participant reporting average napping frequency (Z-score -0.08).

**Cardiovascular and Circadian Rhythms:**
Wearable-derived physiological data indicate aspects of both elevated physiological arousal and general circadian regularity. The participant's Mesor (midpoint of heart rate rhythm) is elevated (83.24 bpm, Z-score 1.27), and their resting heart rate is slightly above average (63.4 bpm, Z-score 0.62). Both higher Mesor and resting heart rate demonstrate positive correlations with CES-D (0.19 each), suggesting a baseline of higher cardiovascular activity that could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. However, other circadian rhythm metrics, such as interdaily stability (Z-score 0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 0.73), are at or above the population average, indicating a relatively stable and robust daily heart rate rhythm. Intradaily variability is below average (Z-score -0.74), suggesting less fragmentation in daily activity patterns, which is typically a positive indicator. The hourly heart rate deviations reveal a typical diurnal pattern, with values significantly below the Mesor during nighttime hours (e.g., -19.26 bpm at 3-4 AM) and above Mesor during waking hours, peaking in the late afternoon/evening (Acrophase at 4:54 PM, with highest positive deviations observed between 9-11 PM). This suggests a generally structured physiological rhythm, despite the elevated baseline arousal.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score:**

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50th percentile, > 11.0):**
The participant exhibits several significant markers strongly associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46, with an exceptionally high correlation of 0.82 with CES-D) is a very strong indicator. Similarly, lower self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.87, correlation -0.71) and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46, correlation -0.41) are substantial psychological vulnerabilities. Furthermore, there is pronounced sleep disturbance, characterized by significantly short sleep duration (Z-score -1.27) and high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.44, correlation 0.2) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.39, correlation 0.21), all robustly linked to increased depressive symptoms. Physiologically, an elevated Mesor (Z-score 1.27, correlation 0.19) and resting heart rate (Z-score 0.62, correlation 0.19) suggest higher baseline physiological arousal, which correlates positively with CES-D. Finally, very low engagement in physical exercise and below-average socializing are general behavioral risk factors for mental well-being.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50th percentile, <= 11.0):**
Conversely, the participant reports several strong indicators of psychological well-being. Exceptionally high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64, correlation -0.47), very low perceived stress (Z-score -0.98, correlation 0.29), and high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.22, correlation -0.4) are all powerful subjective reports that suggest a lower depressive symptom burden. Behavioral patterns include very low substance usage, which is generally a healthy lifestyle choice. Specific recreational habits, such as lower internet usage (Z-score -1.83, correlation 0.26) and lower music listening (Z-score -0.26, correlation 0.25), along with not engaging in sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96, correlation 0.12), are surprisingly correlated with *lower* CES-D scores in this study, implying they may be protective or reflect other positive traits in this context. Wearable data also indicates relatively stable circadian rhythms in terms of intradaily variability (Z-score -0.74) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.73), which generally signify better physiological regulation.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile presents a significant tension between positive self-reported emotional states (happiness, low stress, high health satisfaction) and underlying trait vulnerabilities, disturbed sleep, and physiological arousal. While the self-reported well-being indicators are strong, the robust correlations of trait anxiety (0.82) and self-esteem (-0.71) with CES-D are highly impactful. Trait anxiety and self-esteem are more stable psychological constructs, and their values in this participant strongly align with increased depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the objective and semi-objective measures of sleep disturbance (short duration, high variability) and elevated physiological baseline (Mesor, RHR) provide compelling evidence pointing towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. It is possible that the reported happiness and low stress reflect a coping style or a more superficial assessment, which does not fully capture the deeper, more pervasive psychological and physiological vulnerabilities. Given the strength and consistency of these more stable and objective indicators, particularly the high trait anxiety and low self-esteem, in conjunction with significant sleep and physiological dysregulation, the evidence leans towards an overall higher depressive symptom burden. The population median CES-D is 11.0. Considering the confluence of these significant negative indicators, it is likely that the participant's CES-D score would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

75438,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile. Self-report data indicate a mixed psychological state, characterized by below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53), significantly below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.73), and notably low interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1). These traits are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study population, suggesting an association with higher depressive symptom burden. Additionally, the participant reports clinically disturbed sleep as measured by the PSQI (score 6.0), further corroborated by wearable data. A concerning academic trend is also observed with a substantial drop in GPA from 3.47 to 2.7 in the most recent semester. Conversely, the participant reports being ""not anxious"" with below-average STAI scores (Z-score -0.52) and significantly lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.98), which, given their correlations with CES-D, would typically suggest a lower depressive symptom profile. Satisfaction with physical health is reported as above average (Z-score 0.63).

Behaviorally, the participant maintains high levels of physical activity, engaging in exercise both alone and with others, and sports participation, all at frequencies above the population average. They also report above-average time spent socializing with friends and listening to music. In contrast, engagement in passive recreational activities like watching TV/videos, video games, and reading is significantly below average. Recreational drug use, however, is reported as significantly above the population average (Z-score 1.61), alongside elevated wine or liquor consumption. While correlations with CES-D for these activities are generally weak, the pattern suggests an active social and physically engaged lifestyle, potentially alongside a reliance on substance use.

Physiological and circadian rhythm data from wearables reveal significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 2 minutes (Z-score -1.43), reinforcing the self-reported sleep disturbance. The median sleep start time is late, at 1:43 AM, but its variability is average. Circadian rhythm metrics show slightly less interdaily stability and significantly lower intraday variability (Z-score -1.09) than the population average, indicating somewhat less erratic day-to-day heart rate fluctuations. The participant's overall average heart rate (Mesor) and resting heart rate are both below the population average (Z-scores -0.61), with lower values showing a positive correlation with CES-D. The hourly heart rate profile demonstrates a typical afternoon acrophase around 3:28 PM, with robust physiological arousal during the daytime, particularly between 2-3 PM where mean heart rate deviation from Mesor is over two standard deviations above the population mean. However, a marked and rapid reduction in physiological activity is observed in the late evening hours, with heart rate deviations significantly below the population average (e.g., 7-9 PM), suggesting a pronounced wind-down or reduced engagement preceding the late sleep onset.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a higher CES-D score (top 50th percentile) includes significantly below-average self-esteem, significantly lower interpersonal trust, and below-average happiness, all of which correlate moderately to strongly with higher CES-D scores. The participant's self-reported ""disturbed sleep"" (PSQI score of 6) and objectively measured significantly short sleep duration (6 hours 2 minutes) are strong indicators commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The decline in academic performance, as evidenced by the GPA drop, further supports a potential increase in mental health burden. Furthermore, the participant's lower average heart rate (Mesor and Resting Heart Rate), which shows a positive correlation with CES-D in the study population, also points towards a higher CES-D score.

Conversely, indicators for a lower CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) include below-average anxiety and significantly below-average perceived stress, which have strong and moderate positive correlations with CES-D respectively. Above-average health satisfaction and consistently high levels of exercise (exercising alone, with others, and sports participation), which generally correlate negatively with CES-D, also suggest a lower symptom burden. The above-average social engagement with friends, although weakly correlated, is typically considered a protective factor.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits several protective factors (low anxiety, low stress, high exercise, social engagement, good health satisfaction), the cumulative weight of evidence pointing towards elevated depressive symptomatology is more substantial. The profound deficits in self-esteem, trust, and happiness, combined with clinically significant and objectively severe sleep deprivation, and a concerning academic decline, are robust indicators frequently associated with higher depressive symptom burden. The lower average heart rate also aligns with higher CES-D in this population. Therefore, despite some areas of strength, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is highly likely to place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

99733,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents a mixed psychological and behavioral profile, with self-reported emotional stability juxtaposed against objective and behavioral indicators suggesting potential challenges. Self-reported survey data indicates relatively low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.02, classified as 'not anxious') and low perceived stress (PSS Z-score -0.98), both of which generally correlate with lower depressive symptomatology. The participant also reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -1.26), above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55), and no substance use across multiple categories, factors typically associated with better mental well-being. However, these positive indicators are somewhat offset by slightly below-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.73) and current happiness (Z-score -0.53), which in turn correlate with higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a declining trend in GPA across academic semesters could suggest academic struggles, potentially reflecting underlying difficulties.

A particularly salient pattern emerges from the participant's daily recreation and social habits, pointing towards significant social withdrawal and disengagement. The participant reports spending extremely limited time socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) and minimal engagement in common recreational activities such as listening to music (Z-score -1.19) and general internet usage (Z-score -1.16). While individual exercise is slightly above average, participation in exercise with others is significantly below average (Z-score -0.88), further reinforcing a pattern of reduced social interaction. This profound lack of engagement in typical social and leisure activities is a strong behavioral indicator often associated with symptoms such as anhedonia and social isolation, which are central to depressive experiences.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics further contributes to this complex picture, revealing patterns of circadian rhythm disruption and altered sleep. While subjective sleep quality is reported as good, objective Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 43 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.58). Although sleep duration and sleep start time show good regularity (below-average standard deviations), the overall short duration is notable. The heart rate-derived circadian rhythm analysis shows a less robust pattern, characterized by a lower amplitude (Z-score -0.43), indicating a flattened difference between peak and trough activity, and higher intradaily variability (Z-score 1.09), suggesting more fragmented activity within the day. Additionally, interdaily stability (Z-score -0.16) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.53) are below average, collectively pointing to a less regular and stable physiological rhythm. A slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.53) may also indicate heightened baseline physiological arousal. These objective physiological markers are frequently observed in individuals experiencing mood disorders. The aggregate hourly heart rate deviations demonstrate a typical diurnal pattern, peaking in the afternoon (acrophase at 3:08 PM), but the underlying circadian dysregulation indicated by other metrics suggests a less optimal physiological state.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong self-reported indicators that would typically suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. These include significantly low trait anxiety (STAI score Z-score -1.02), which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), implying that low anxiety would predict a low CES-D. Similarly, perceived stress is markedly low (PSS Z-score -0.98), also correlating positively with CES-D (0.28), indicating lower stress would predict lower CES-D. Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score -1.26), a factor generally associated with better mental health outcomes. Furthermore, above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) and slightly above-average trust (Z-score 0.18) correlate negatively with CES-D (-0.39 and -0.41, respectively), further supporting a lower CES-D. The participant also reports no substance use across various categories, which is generally indicative of healthier coping mechanisms. Objectively, sleep duration and sleep start time show good consistency (below-average standard deviations).

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite some favorable self-reported emotional states, a substantial body of evidence points towards elevated depressive symptomatology. Most notably, the participant displays extreme social withdrawal and disengagement from typical recreational activities. They report exceptionally low time spent socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41), and minimal engagement in common leisure pursuits like listening to music (Z-score -1.19) and general internet usage (Z-score -1.16). This pronounced behavioral pattern of social isolation and lack of engagement is a core feature often associated with anhedonia and depressive states. Self-reported self-esteem (Z-score -0.73) and current happiness (Z-score -0.53) are below average, and their strong negative correlations with CES-D (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively) indicate that these lower scores would predict a higher CES-D. Objectively, sleep duration is below the population average (Z-score -0.58), despite subjective reports of good sleep. Moreover, heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveal significant dysregulation, including a flattened amplitude (Z-score -0.43) and increased intradaily variability (Z-score 1.09), patterns frequently observed in individuals experiencing mood disturbances. The declining GPA trend across semesters also suggests potential academic or motivational struggles that can accompany depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile presents a significant divergence between some self-reported emotional well-being indicators (low anxiety, low stress, good subjective sleep) and robust behavioral and physiological data suggesting underlying depressive symptom burden. While the low self-reported anxiety and stress, with their strong correlations to CES-D, initially suggest a lower score, the comprehensive analysis reveals a different picture. The extreme levels of social withdrawal and disengagement from recreational activities are highly salient behavioral markers strongly indicative of depressive symptoms like anhedonia and social isolation. These objective behavioral patterns, coupled with the documented physiological dysregulation in circadian rhythms and shorter objective sleep duration, are powerful indicators often observed in depression. The lower self-esteem and happiness scores also align with elevated depressive symptoms. Given that behavioral and physiological measures may be less subject to self-report bias or underreporting, especially when emotional states are not fully acknowledged, the weight of evidence points towards the participant experiencing a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The profound behavioral disengagement and objective physiological disruptions are highly suggestive of an overall CES-D score that would place the participant in the higher half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits notable self-reported psychological distress and compromised well-being. Trait anxiety is elevated, with a STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86), classifying the individual as ""anxious,"" a measure strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.82). Self-esteem is slightly below the population average (score 36.0, Z-score -0.31), a factor that correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting lower self-esteem is associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress levels are slightly above average (score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), aligning with a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). Satisfaction with physical health is somewhat lower than the population mean (score 3.56, Z-score -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). While the participant reports slightly above-average happiness (score 4.0, Z-score 0.55), this measure shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting that despite some reported happiness, other indicators of well-being are concurrently compromised.

Sleep patterns are significantly disrupted, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), signifying clinically relevant poor sleep quality. Wearable data reinforces these concerns, showing a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score -1.17), which is substantially below the population average. Furthermore, sleep duration exhibits above-average variability (standard deviation of 120 minutes, Z-score 0.43), a characteristic moderately positively correlated with CES-D (0.2), suggesting inconsistent sleep duration may contribute to depressive symptoms. The participant's median sleep start time is notably late at 02:02:30. Interestingly, the standard deviation of sleep start time is below average (51 minutes, Z-score -0.71), indicating a relatively consistent, albeit late, sleep onset. Given the moderate positive correlation (0.22) between sleep start time variability and CES-D, this lower variability in sleep onset would, in isolation, suggest *lower* depressive symptoms in this particular aspect. Overall, the sleep profile points towards chronic sleep insufficiency and poor subjective quality, albeit with a consistent late timing.

Physiological activity patterns, derived from heart rate data, reveal a significantly low Mesor (mean heart rate of 65.18 BPM, Z-score -1.2) and resting heart rate (46.3 BPM, Z-score -1.41). Both these metrics show a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.19), suggesting that for this population, lower baseline heart rate and average heart rate are associated with a higher depressive symptom burden. The heart rate amplitude is above average (12.22, Z-score 0.47), indicating notable daily physiological fluctuations. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:46 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations further support a later activity pattern, with significantly elevated heart rates observed between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM (Z-scores 1.82 and 2.25 respectively), indicating substantial physiological arousal during these evening hours. Regarding daily habits, the participant reports above-average engagement in various forms of exercise (e.g., sports at Z-score 0.91), which generally correlates negatively with CES-D, suggesting a potentially protective factor. Conversely, there is notably low engagement in socializing with friends (31 minutes, Z-score -0.62) and a significant lack of listening to music (""Do not do,"" Z-score -1.19). The latter, listening to music, is moderately positively correlated with CES-D (0.25), indicating that reduced engagement with music is associated with higher depressive symptoms, potentially reflecting anhedonia.

Despite these challenges, the participant maintains a strong academic record, evidenced by consistently high GPAs ranging from 3.74 to 3.94 across multiple semesters. This suggests that academic functioning remains largely unaffected, possibly indicating a coping mechanism or a domain of resilience for the individual. Lifestyle behaviors indicate minimal substance use; the participant reports no use of wine, liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, with only occasional beer consumption. This implies that substance use is not a prominent coping mechanism or a significant contributing factor to distress for this individual.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological state shows significant indicators of elevated depressive symptom burden. The STAI (trait anxiety) score is 50.0 (Z-score 0.86), placing them in the ""anxious"" range and exhibiting a very strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D scores. Subjective sleep quality is poor, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), indicative of clinically significant sleep disturbance, which is a key symptom of depression. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.31) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), implying lower self-esteem is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Additionally, perceived stress is slightly above average (Z-score 0.38) and moderately correlated with CES-D (0.28). Wearable data corroborates poor sleep patterns, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours 14 minutes (Z-score -1.17), significantly below average. There is also above-average variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.43), which is positively correlated with CES-D (0.2), suggesting inconsistent sleep duration is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Behaviorally, the participant reports significantly low engagement in leisure activities such as listening to music (""Do not do,"" Z-score -1.19), which is moderately positively correlated with CES-D (0.25), potentially indicating anhedonia. Physiologically, both the Mesor (Z-score -1.2) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -1.41) are significantly low for the study population, and both show a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.19), suggesting that lower baseline physiological arousal is associated with higher depressive symptoms in this context.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, some indicators suggest areas of relative strength or average functioning. The participant reports slightly above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting this aspect might somewhat mitigate overall depressive burden. Academic performance remains consistently high, with GPAs well within the excellent range across multiple semesters, indicating that depressive symptoms, if present, are not severely impacting a crucial area of university life. The participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in various forms of exercise at above-average frequencies, a behavior generally associated with lower CES-D scores. Substance use is minimal, with no reported use of illicit drugs or significant alcohol consumption, suggesting a lack of maladaptive coping mechanisms in this area. While overall sleep duration is short, the participant exhibits below-average variability in sleep start time (Z-score -0.71), indicating a relatively consistent sleep schedule (even if it is consistently late). Given that higher variability in sleep start time is positively correlated with CES-D (0.22), this participant's *lower* variability in sleep start time would, in isolation, suggest *lower* CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the evidence, the factors pointing towards an elevated depressive symptom burden are more numerous and impactful. The strong self-reported indicators of anxiety, poor sleep quality, lower self-esteem, and elevated perceived stress are highly indicative of psychological distress and are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores. The corroborating wearable data regarding insufficient and variable sleep duration, combined with the behavioral pattern of reduced engagement in pleasurable activities like music, further strengthens the inference of elevated symptoms. While the participant's high academic achievement, active lifestyle, and minimal substance use suggest areas of resilience, these do not outweigh the substantial evidence for internal distress. The physiological data from Mesor and Resting Heart Rate, interpreted with their positive correlations to CES-D, also lean towards a higher symptom profile. Therefore, based on the comprehensive multimodal data, the participant is more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms that place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

43794,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological and behavioral data present a consistent pattern indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably high (Score: 55.0, Z-score: 1.35), classifying the participant as anxious and demonstrating a very strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.82). Concurrently, self-esteem is reported as relatively low (Score: 32.0, Z-Score: -0.87), a finding that correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D scores (-0.71). Further evidence of psychological distress includes lower self-reported happiness (Z-Score: -0.53) and higher perceived stress (Score: 26.0, Z-Score: 1.19). Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score: -1.45), and interpersonal trust is also reported below the population mean (Z-Score: -0.78), both showing negative correlations with CES-D. Academically, the participant's GPA experienced a decline from 3.87 to 3.33 in the Fall 2016 semester, potentially reflecting an impact on academic functioning. Daily recreational habits indicate a significant engagement in listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.06), but reduced engagement in activities like socializing with friends (Z-Score: -0.62) and reading (Z-Score: -0.67), which may suggest a narrowing of interests or social withdrawal. The participant's exercise habits involve above-average frequency of exercising with others (Z-Score: 0.53), which carries a negative correlation with CES-D, suggesting a potential mitigating factor.

Sleep patterns show significant disturbances, both subjectively and objectively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-Score: 0.59) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. Fitbit data further substantiates this, showing a high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation: 156 minutes, Z-Score: 1.25) and sleep start times (Standard Deviation: 122 minutes, Z-Score: 0.86). The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:02:54 AM, contributing to irregular sleep schedules. While the median sleep duration of 6 hours and 59 minutes is only slightly below the population mean, the inconsistency in timing and duration, coupled with the self-reported poor sleep quality, points to a disrupted sleep architecture that is often associated with depressive symptoms. The absence of daily naps (Z-Score: -0.86) in conjunction with these disturbances suggests a lack of compensatory sleep.

Physiological markers derived from wearable data reveal significant disruptions to circadian rhythms. The participant exhibits very low Interdaily Stability (Value: 0.2, Z-Score: -1.73), indicating highly irregular day-to-day patterns in activity and rest. Crucially, the amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is very low (Value: 5.34, Z-Score: -1.76), suggesting a blunted physiological rhythm with less pronounced distinction between peak and trough heart rate activity throughout the day. This blunted amplitude, combined with a late acrophase at 5:00 PM, points to a dysregulated and less robust daily physiological cycle. The participant's resting heart rate is also elevated (Value: 70.8, Z-Score: 1.5), which can signify a state of chronic physiological arousal or stress. Analysis of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor also supports a blunted diurnal rhythm, with early morning heart rates (e.g., 2-6 AM) showing higher values relative to the population's deviations during those hours, potentially indicating less restorative sleep or altered autonomic function even during periods of rest.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence from both self-reported psychological measures and objective wearable data indicates that the participant likely experiences an elevated burden of depressive symptoms, placing their CES-D score in the top half of the study population. Self-report findings are particularly strong: the participant exhibits high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.35, with a very high correlation of 0.82 to CES-D), low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.87, with a very high negative correlation of -0.71), disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 0.59), lower happiness (Z-score -0.53, moderate correlation -0.46), and elevated perceived stress (PSS Z-score 1.19). Additionally, low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.45, moderate correlation -0.39) and low trust (Z-score -0.78, moderate correlation -0.41) further contribute to this pattern. Behaviorally, reduced engagement in socializing and reading aligns with symptoms of depression. Objectively, wearable data supports these psychological findings with marked circadian rhythm disruptions, including very low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.73) and a blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.76). Elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.5) suggests physiological stress. Furthermore, highly variable sleep duration (Z-score 1.25) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.86), coupled with a late median sleep start time, point to significant sleep dysregulation, a common feature in depression.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score is comparatively weak and limited. The participant's median sleep duration, at just under 7 hours (Z-score -0.24), is close to the population average, which might on its own suggest adequate sleep. However, this is contradicted by the PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep and significant variability in sleep patterns. The Intradaily Variability of heart rate (Z-score 0.03) is within the average range. The participant's above-average frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 0.53) and its modest negative correlation with CES-D (-0.23) could be a potential protective factor, yet this single aspect is insufficient to counterbalance the extensive evidence for elevated symptoms. High engagement in listening to music (Z-score 2.06) is also noted, but its weak positive correlation (0.26) with CES-D does not suggest a mitigating effect. The participant's GPA, despite a recent decline, remains above average, which is not directly indicative of low depressive symptomatology.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly points towards a high burden of depressive symptomatology. Multiple self-report measures of anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, stress, and sleep quality show deviations consistent with elevated depressive symptoms, many with strong correlations to CES-D. These subjective experiences are corroborated by objective physiological and behavioral data from wearables, highlighting severe disruptions in circadian rhythms, sleep regularity, and physiological arousal. The magnitude and consistency of these indicators across diverse data modalities strongly suggest that the participant's CES-D score would place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution.

51437,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by notable self-reported psychological strengths alongside significant physiological and sleep dysregulation. Psychologically, the individual reports low trait anxiety, with a STAI score (Z-score -0.62) indicating a ""not anxious"" classification, a factor strongly and positively correlated with depressive symptoms (correlation 0.81, implying lower anxiety is associated with lower CES-D). Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 0.96), which is also strongly inversely related to depressive symptoms (correlation -0.71), suggesting higher self-esteem is predictive of lower CES-D scores. Other self-reported strengths include lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.44), higher interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5), and higher satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.3). These traits, coupled with consistent high academic performance (GPA consistently above 3.69), generally indicate psychological resilience and adaptive functioning. However, the participant's self-reported happiness is somewhat lower than average (Z-score -0.53), which correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting a potential area of concern amidst overall positive self-perception.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a high engagement in physical activity, reporting exercising alone and participating in sports three times a week or more, with notably high Z-scores (1.07 and 1.58 respectively). Substance use is minimal, indicating responsible lifestyle choices in this area. Recreational habits include higher-than-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies, but a notable absence of engagement in listening to music or reading, alongside average social interaction with friends. These patterns, while varied, do not present strong direct correlations with CES-D scores in a consistent direction and thus offer less direct insight into depressive symptomatology compared to psychological and physiological metrics.

In contrast to the self-reported psychological strengths, objective physiological and sleep data reveal substantial dysregulation. The participant experiences subjective ""Disturbed Sleep"" as indicated by a PSQI score of 6.0, exceeding the commonly accepted clinical threshold for sleep impairment. Wearable data corroborates this, showing a significantly shorter median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score -1.16) and a very late median sleep start time of 02:14:30 AM. Despite the late sleep onset, sleep start times are relatively consistent (low standard deviation Z-score -1.12), indicating a stable but delayed sleep phase. Physiological measures further highlight a state of chronic arousal and disturbed circadian rhythm. The resting heart rate is markedly elevated at 73.0 bpm (Z-score 1.77), and the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is higher than average (Z-score 1.29). The heart rate circadian rhythm exhibits a significantly reduced amplitude (Z-score -1.59) and higher intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51), suggesting a less robust and more fragmented physiological rhythm. Additionally, interdaily stability is lower than average (Z-score -0.82), indicating less day-to-day regularity in activity patterns.

Further examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals pronounced physiological activation during typical resting hours. Specifically, the participant exhibits extremely elevated heart rates in the very late evening and early morning, with deviations reaching +25.6 bpm (Z-score 3.91) between 12-1 AM and +13.67 bpm (Z-score 1.52) between 11-12 AM. This pattern of sustained high physiological arousal during nighttime hours, when most individuals are in deep rest, strongly indicates a significantly disrupted sleep-wake cycle and potential chronic physiological stress, which often co-occurs with sleep disturbances and could impact overall well-being.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile)**
The participant's self-reported psychological traits provide strong evidence suggesting a lower or median CES-D score. The STAI-Trait score (35.0, Z-score -0.62) indicates an individual who is ""not anxious,"" and this measure exhibits a high positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), meaning lower trait anxiety is strongly associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Furthermore, the participant reports notably high self-esteem (RSES score 45.0, Z-score 0.96), which has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), implying that higher self-esteem is highly predictive of lower depressive symptomatology. Other self-reported factors, such as lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.44, correlation 0.28), higher interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5, correlation -0.41), and greater health satisfaction (Z-score 0.3, correlation -0.39), also trend towards a lower CES-D score, although with moderate correlations compared to STAI and Self-Esteem. The participant's consistent high academic performance and frequent engagement in physical exercise are additional behavioral indicators often associated with better mental health outcomes.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile)**
Conversely, substantial evidence from objective physiological and sleep measures points towards factors typically associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0 indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" crossing a common clinical threshold for sleep impairment, a core symptom of depression. This is further supported by wearable data revealing a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes (Z-score -1.16) and a very late median sleep start time (02:14:30). Physiologically, the resting heart rate is markedly high (73.0 bpm, Z-score 1.77), as is the overall average heart rate (Mesor, Z-score 1.29), suggesting chronic physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm exhibits a significantly flattened amplitude (Z-score -1.59) and higher intradaily variability (Z-score 1.51), indicating a less robust and potentially dysregulated daily physiological pattern. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals extreme physiological activation during late night and early morning hours (e.g., 12-1 AM deviation of +25.6, Z-score 3.91), signifying significant nocturnal disturbance and stress. Lastly, the participant's self-reported happiness is lower than average (Z-score -0.53), which correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting a tendency towards higher depressive symptoms. While these physiological and sleep metrics are significant indicators of distress, their direct correlations with CES-D in the provided dataset are notably weaker compared to the self-reported psychological traits.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**
The interpretation of this participant's CES-D score requires carefully weighing seemingly contradictory data points. The self-reported psychological measures (STAI, Self-Esteem, Trust, Stress, Health Satisfaction) present a strong profile of resilience and positive mental health, with exceptionally robust correlations indicating these traits are strongly associated with *lower* depressive symptoms in this study population. This suggests that the participant's subjective experience of depression, as measured by CES-D, is likely to be lower. In contrast, the objective physiological and sleep data demonstrate a clear pattern of severe dysregulation, chronic arousal, and disturbed sleep. While these are strong indicators of poor well-being and are often associated with depression, their direct correlations with the CES-D score in this specific dataset are notably weaker. Given the task's emphasis on using correlations to aid interpretation without overriding the holistic analysis, the powerful predictive strength of the self-reported psychological traits (STAI and Self-Esteem) with their exceptionally strong correlations to CES-D outweighs the observed physiological dysregulation, whose link to CES-D is less direct in this data. Therefore, despite the compelling evidence of physiological stress and sleep disturbance, the participant's strong self-reported psychological strengths, which are highly predictive of lower depressive symptom burden according to the provided correlations, lead to the conclusion that their CES-D score is likely in the bottom half of the study population.

21932,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a mixed psychological profile, characterized by notable strengths in trait-level coping mechanisms alongside some indicators of current distress and behavioral shifts. Self-report data indicates significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI score 28.0, Z-score -1.31) and very low perceived stress (PSS score 13.0, Z-score -2.34) relative to the study population. These scores are typically associated with reduced vulnerability to depressive symptoms, a pattern supported by their strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81 for STAI) and positive correlation with CES-D (0.28 for PSS). Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES score 50.0, Z-score 1.66) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (score 5.0, Z-score 0.55), which are generally protective factors against depression, consistent with their strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71 and -0.39, respectively). Conversely, the participant reports lower-than-average current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) and lower interpersonal trust (score 3.0, Z-score -0.46). Both of these metrics correlate negatively with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.41), suggesting these lower levels of happiness and trust would be associated with a higher depressive symptom burden.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains generally healthy habits regarding exercise and substance use. Exercise frequencies (1-2 times a week for both alone and with others, 1-2 times a month for sports) are typical or slightly above average for the population, and substance use is consistently low. However, a notable pattern emerges in recreational and social engagement. The participant reports abstaining from several common recreational activities, including watching TV/videos, playing video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies. While internet usage is average, socializing with friends is reported at a lower frequency (31 minutes an hour, Z-score -0.62). This general disengagement from typical recreational pursuits and reduced social interaction, despite weak correlations with CES-D for most recreational items, could suggest a reduction in activities that typically provide pleasure or social connection.

Sleep patterns present a notable dichotomy between objective consistency and subjective quality. Fitbit data indicates robust objective sleep, with a significantly longer median sleep duration of 8 hours and 14 minutes (Z-score 1.31) and remarkably low variability in both sleep duration (50 minutes standard deviation, Z-score -1.15) and sleep start times (55 minutes standard deviation, Z-score -0.61). These metrics suggest a highly consistent and ample sleep schedule. In contrast, the participant's self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) classifies their sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This discrepancy highlights that while the participant obtains sufficient and regular sleep, their subjective experience of that sleep is poor.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological data reveals a relatively stable underlying circadian rhythm, as indicated by an above-average Interdaily Stability (0.49, Z-score 0.67). However, this stability is accompanied by above-average Intradaily Variability (0.68, Z-score 0.95), suggesting greater fragmentation in daily physiological activity. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate-based circadian rhythm, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:20 PM. Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor (overall mean heart rate) indicates generally lower resting heart rate (54.1 bpm, Z-score -0.48) and mesor (69.72 bpm, Z-score -0.58) compared to the population, reflecting good cardiovascular fitness. However, the data reveals pronounced periods of physiological arousal. Specifically, there are significant elevations in heart rate deviation during midday (e.g., 12-1 PM: 24.18 bpm above mesor, Z-score 2.59; 1-2 PM: 20.23 bpm above mesor, Z-score 2.11) and, most notably, an exceptionally high peak in the late evening (10-11 PM: 26.39 bpm above mesor, Z-score 3.14). This substantial and late-occurring physiological activation, particularly prior to typical sleep hours, could contribute to the participant's self-reported disturbed sleep quality, despite objective measures showing ample sleep duration and regularity.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several robust protective factors against depressive symptoms. They report significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.31), substantially higher self-esteem (RSES Z-score 1.66), and remarkably low perceived stress (PSS Z-score -2.34). These self-report measures are accompanied by strong correlations with CES-D (0.81 for STAI, -0.71 for RSES, 0.28 for PSS), strongly indicating a predisposition for lower depressive symptomatology within this population. Objectively, wearable data shows the participant achieves ample sleep duration (median 8 hours 14 minutes, Z-score 1.31) and exhibits high consistency in both sleep duration and start times (Z-scores -1.15 and -0.61 respectively), which are generally associated with better mental well-being. Furthermore, their interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) suggests a regular daily rhythm, a pattern often linked to healthier physiological functioning.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the protective factors, several indicators point towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant's self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) categorizes their sleep as ""Disturbed,"" directly contradicting objective sleep metrics and indicating a subjective experience of poor sleep, a common symptom of depression. They also report lower current happiness (Z-score -0.53) and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46), both of which correlate negatively with CES-D, suggesting these would be associated with higher depressive scores. Behaviorally, the participant reports notably low engagement in a range of common recreational activities and lower-than-average social interaction with friends, which could be indicative of anhedonia or social withdrawal. Physiologically, while the overall rhythm is stable, the participant exhibits higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.95), suggesting more fragmented daily activity. Most strikingly, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows an extremely elevated deviation from mesor in the late evening (10-11 PM, Z-score 3.14), representing a significant period of physiological arousal immediately preceding typical sleep onset. This nocturnal arousal could explain the subjective disturbed sleep and is a notable physiological marker that could be associated with heightened distress.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a complex profile where strong psychological resources (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, very low perceived stress) that are highly correlated with lower CES-D scores appear to be primary protective factors. These traits, with their substantial Z-scores and strong correlations, are significant indicators of resilience. However, this is counterbalanced by several concerning state-based and physiological indicators. The self-reported disturbed sleep quality, lower current happiness, and especially the pronounced late-evening physiological arousal suggest a current struggle that is not fully captured by the trait measures. The lack of engagement in recreational activities and reduced socializing also points towards potential anhedonia or withdrawal. While these latter indicators are salient, their correlations with CES-D are generally weaker than those of the protective traits. Considering the combined evidence, the exceptionally strong and consistent indicators of psychological resilience (STAI, Self-Esteem, Stress) with their high predictive correlations likely mitigate the impact of the more acute symptoms and physiological disturbances. Therefore, while certain elements suggest distress, the overall profile is more consistent with a relatively lower depressive symptom burden within the study population.

The participant's psychological profile indicates a notable vulnerability to internalizing symptoms. Self-report data reveal significantly elevated trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 49.0 (Z-score 0.76), classifying them as anxious relative to the population. This trait anxiety exhibits a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Concurrently, the participant reports notably low self-esteem, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 31.0 (Z-score -1.01), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). While perceived stress levels are close to the population average (PSS Z-score 0.1), the participant expresses lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7), a factor negatively correlated with CES-D. In contrast, self-reported happiness is somewhat above average (Z-score 0.55), and interpersonal trust is higher than the mean (Z-score 0.83), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D and may serve as protective psychological factors. Despite these challenges, the participant demonstrates strong academic performance with a consistent pattern of high GPAs.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in sports at a higher frequency (Z-score 0.91) and exercising alone slightly more often (Z-score 0.32) compared to peers. These forms of physical activity are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, self-reported wine or liquor consumption is notably higher than average (Z-score 0.94). Recreational habits include significantly more time spent listening to music (Z-score 1.13) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 0.64), while engagement in reading and more sedentary hobbies is reported as lower than average.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal certain patterns related to cardiovascular activity and circadian rhythms. The participant's resting heart rate (64.05 bpm, Z-score 0.7) and heart rate MESOR (76.96 bpm, Z-score 0.41) are both slightly above the population average, with both metrics showing a positive correlation with CES-D. While the acrophase for heart rate occurs at a typical time (5:23 PM), hourly aggregate heart rate deviations indicate higher physiological arousal relative to the population during late evening hours (e.g., 7-8 PM with a Z-score of 0.94 and 9-10 PM with a Z-score of 0.82). Despite these elevations, the overall regularity and consistency of the heart rate-based circadian rhythm, as measured by interdaily stability (Z-score 0.25) and intradaily variability (Z-score 0.1), are close to the population mean, suggesting no significant disruption in the fundamental physiological rhythmicity itself.

Sleep patterns present a complex picture. The participant self-reports clinically significant sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score 6.0), indicating subjective difficulties. Objectively, wearable data show a significantly longer median sleep duration of 8 hours 47 minutes (Z-score 2.0) compared to the population. However, this extended sleep duration is accompanied by substantial variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 133 minutes, Z-score 0.73) and sleep start time (standard deviation 140 minutes, Z-score 1.26). The median sleep start time is notably late (00:54:20). The high variability in sleep timing and duration, which are positively correlated with CES-D, suggests an inconsistent and potentially dysregulated sleep-wake schedule, despite the overall long periods of sleep.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Foremost are the significantly high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.76) and markedly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.01), both of which show robust correlations with CES-D (0.81 and -0.71, respectively). Additionally, the self-reported clinically significant sleep disturbance (PSQI score 6.0) aligns with a key depressive symptom, and objective sleep data reveal high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.73) and sleep start time (Z-score 1.26), with both standard deviations being positively correlated with CES-D. An elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.7) and heart rate MESOR (Z-score 0.41), both positively correlated with CES-D, suggest increased physiological arousal. Lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.7) also correlates negatively with CES-D. The unusually long sleep duration, while not directly correlated, could potentially indicate hypersomnia, a symptom in some forms of depression, especially when coupled with poor sleep quality and high variability.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Counterbalancing these indicators are several factors that are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. The participant consistently achieves high academic performance, suggesting effective coping mechanisms in this domain. Self-reported happiness is somewhat above average (Z-score 0.55) and interpersonal trust is higher than the mean (Z-score 0.83), both showing negative correlations with CES-D. The participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in sports at an above-average frequency (Z-score 0.91), and exercise is generally considered a protective factor against depression. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score 0.1). Furthermore, overall circadian rhythm regularity (Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability) is within typical population ranges, with low correlations to CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When weighing the collective evidence, the indicators suggestive of a higher CES-D score appear to be more directly central and impactful regarding depressive symptomatology. The significant elevations in trait anxiety and marked deficits in self-esteem are very strong and consistently correlated psychological markers of depression. Coupled with self-reported disturbed sleep, significant variability in sleep patterns (despite long overall sleep duration), and indicators of heightened physiological arousal (elevated resting heart rate and mesor), these factors strongly point towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. While the participant exhibits resilience in academics, higher happiness and trust, and an active lifestyle, these potential protective factors are likely offset by the pervasive nature of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and sleep dysregulation, which are core features commonly observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. Therefore, the overall pattern of findings suggests that the participant's CES-D score would likely fall into the higher half of the study population.

54030,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant demonstrates a generally favorable psychological profile across several self-report measures, suggesting robust internal resources despite some physiological and sleep irregularities. They report low trait anxiety (Z-score -1.41), classifying them as ""not anxious,"" a trait strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 1.52), which also holds a substantial negative correlation with depressive symptoms (r=-0.71). Further supporting a positive psychological state, the participant reports high levels of happiness (Z-score 1.64) and interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.47), both of which inversely correlate with CES-D scores. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score 0.72) with a negative correlation. While perceived stress is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.65), its correlation with depressive symptoms is moderate (r=0.29) and overshadowed by other stronger protective factors. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, has been consistently strong. The participant generally abstains from substance use, and engages in above-average exercise with others and sports, which are often associated with positive mental health outcomes. Socializing with friends is also above average.

In contrast to the generally positive self-reported psychological well-being, objective wearable data reveals patterns in sleep and circadian rhythmicity that typically correlate with increased depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as ""Good Sleep"" (Z-score -0.8), placing the participant below the population average for sleep disturbance. However, objective Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 18 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -1.09). Furthermore, sleep patterns exhibit considerable variability: sleep duration standard deviation is notably high (143 minutes, Z-score 0.96), and sleep start time standard deviation is slightly above average (88 minutes, Z-score 0.11). Both sleep duration and start time variability positively correlate with CES-D scores. The participant also reports significantly above-average napping (Z-score 1.75), which also positively correlates with CES-D. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -1.07) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.2), alongside significantly high intradaily variability (Z-score 2.36), indicating less regularity and more fragmentation in daily activity/rest cycles. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is below average (Z-score -1.29), suggesting a flatter physiological rhythm, a characteristic that negatively correlates with CES-D.

Regarding daily physiological activity, the participant's resting heart rate is within the average range (Z-score 0.03). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates typical drops in cardiovascular activity during early morning sleep hours. However, there is a distinct elevation in heart rate in the late evening, particularly between 10-11 PM (deviation of 14.19 from mesor, Z-score 1.22), which suggests elevated physiological arousal during a period when heart rate typically begins to decline in preparation for sleep. This late-night elevation precedes a steep drop in heart rate, aligning with the reported median sleep start time of approximately 3:00 AM. While overall physiological arousal patterns show fluctuations, the combination of compromised sleep duration, high sleep variability, increased napping, and altered circadian rhythmicity (low stability, high variability, low amplitude) indicates a level of physiological and behavioral dysregulation often associated with, and correlating with, elevated depressive symptoms in the study population.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits a robust set of self-reported psychological characteristics that are strongly associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Specifically, their significantly low trait anxiety (Z-score -1.41, r=0.81 with CES-D), high self-esteem (Z-score 1.52, r=-0.71 with CES-D), high happiness (Z-score 1.64, r=-0.46 with CES-D), and high trust (Z-score 1.47, r=-0.41 with CES-D) are powerful indicators. The participant's self-reported good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) and above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.72, r=-0.39 with CES-D) further support a lower depressive burden. Additionally, engaging in exercise with others and sports at an above-average frequency (Z-scores 0.53 and 0.91 respectively, with r=-0.23 for exercising with others) generally points to active coping strategies and social engagement that are protective against depression.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Despite the strong psychological protective factors, several objective physiological and behavioral metrics, particularly concerning sleep and circadian rhythms, suggest vulnerabilities often correlated with higher depressive symptoms. The participant's median sleep duration is below average (Z-score -1.09), and there is significantly high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.96, r=0.20 with CES-D) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.11, r=0.22 with CES-D). A significantly above-average frequency of napping (Z-score 1.75, r=0.22 with CES-D) also correlates with higher CES-D. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -1.07), elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 2.36), and a flatter amplitude (Z-score -1.29, r=-0.11 with CES-D), all of which suggest a less regular and potentially more dysregulated physiological rhythm, commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms. The elevated heart rate in the late evening (10-11 PM, Z-score 1.22) also points to potential physiological arousal preceding sleep. Self-reported perceived stress is slightly above average (Z-score 0.65, r=0.29 with CES-D), and above-average time spent on passive recreation like watching TV/videos (Z-score 1.28, r=0.13 with CES-D) shows weak positive correlations.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The evidence presents a mixed picture, with strong indicators of psychological well-being juxtaposed against objective sleep and circadian rhythm dysregulation. However, the magnitude of the Z-scores and correlations of the self-reported psychological traits (e.g., STAI, Self-Esteem, Happiness, Trust) provides very strong evidence for a lower burden of depressive symptoms. These self-reported psychological constructs are highly salient and demonstrate substantial inverse relationships with CES-D scores in this study population. While the sleep and circadian rhythm data point to areas of potential vulnerability and physiological disruption that correlate with higher CES-D, the strength of these correlations is generally weaker, and they do not outweigh the compelling evidence from the psychological well-being measures. Therefore, despite some physiological irregularities, the overall profile strongly suggests that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would fall into the lower half of the study population distribution.

34062,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The participant's data reveal a comprehensive psychological and physiological profile. On self-report measures, there is a notable pattern of positive mental well-being and adaptive functioning. The participant exhibits low trait anxiety (STAI score of 36.0, Z-score = -0.52), indicating a disposition that is not typically anxious within the study population. This is further supported by an exceptionally high self-esteem score (48.0, Z-score = 1.38) and high reported happiness (Current score of 5.0, Z-score = 1.64). Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is very high (score of 6.67, Z-score = 1.8). These self-reported psychological attributes are consistently and moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study, suggesting a lower likelihood of depressive symptomatology based on these domains. Academic performance, as reflected by an improving GPA (from 3.4 to 3.75), also indicates effective coping and engagement in academic pursuits. Lifestyle habits include above-average engagement in exercise, both alone and with others, which is generally associated with positive mental health outcomes. Substance use, specifically alcohol, is reported at an average to slightly above-average frequency, while the use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs is absent.

Conversely, the participant reports significant subjective sleep disturbance, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score = 1.52), classifying their sleep as disturbed. This is a clinically relevant indicator, often associated with various mental health concerns, including depression. Perceived stress levels are also elevated (PSS score of 26.0, Z-score = 1.19), a factor that shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D scores in this population. While objective sleep duration is average (7 hours 6 minutes, Z-score = -0.11), the participant reports an above-average frequency of napping (Z-score = 0.82), which could potentially compensate for perceived poor nocturnal sleep quality or indicate underlying fatigue. Additionally, while sleep duration consistency is good, the standard deviation of sleep start times is slightly above average (95 minutes, Z-score = 0.26), suggesting some variability in bedtime routine. The participant's trust levels are slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.46), and this factor correlates moderately negatively with CES-D scores, implying lower trust might be associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Physiologically, wearable data reveal a distinctive cardiovascular pattern. The participant exhibits a remarkably low average heart rate (MESOR = 58.67 bpm, Z-score = -2.08) and a low resting heart rate (45.7 bpm, Z-score = -1.48), both significantly below the study population mean. These lower heart rate metrics show a weak positive correlation with CES-D, indicating that for this population, lower heart rates may be weakly associated with slightly higher depressive symptoms. The circadian rhythm exhibits typical patterns in terms of regularity (Interdaily Stability Z-score = -0.41) and variability (Intradaily Variability Z-score = 0.17), though the 24-hour autocorrelation is somewhat lower than average (Z-score = -0.87), suggesting slightly less day-to-day consistency in their overall heart rate rhythm. Hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR show pronounced peaks of physiological activity or arousal during the morning (7-9 AM) and late afternoon/early evening (5-7 PM), with Z-scores reaching up to 2.38 and 2.02 respectively, indicating significant daily engagement. A rapid and deep decline in heart rate is observed in the late evening, particularly between 11 PM and 1 AM, with values dropping substantially below the MESOR (Z-score = -2.65 at 11 PM-12 AM), consistent with a quick transition to a state of rest. The acrophase, or the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 3:08 PM.

Overall Ranking of CES-D Score:

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
The participant demonstrates several strong indicators consistent with a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms. Their self-reported trait anxiety is low (Z-score = -0.52), and this measure has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores, suggesting that lower anxiety is associated with lower CES-D. Critically, the participant reports exceptionally high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.38), high happiness (Z-score = 1.64), and very high health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.8), all of which are strongly to moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71, -0.46, and -0.39 respectively). These robust findings suggest that the participant experiences a high degree of positive self-regard, affective well-being, and physical health contentment, which are protective factors against elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, their consistent academic success and engagement in regular exercise habits align with a profile of overall adaptive functioning.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
Conversely, there are several data points that suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptoms. The most prominent is the significantly elevated PSQI score (Z-score = 1.52), indicating disturbed subjective sleep quality, a common symptom of depression. While objective sleep duration is average, the above-average frequency of napping (Z-score = 0.82) and slightly inconsistent sleep start times (Z-score = 0.26) also show weak positive correlations with CES-D scores, potentially indicating compensatory behaviors for inadequate nocturnal sleep. The participant also reports elevated perceived stress (Z-score = 1.19), which has a weak positive correlation (0.29) with CES-D. Additionally, slightly lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = -0.46) correlates moderately negatively with CES-D (-0.41), meaning lower trust would be associated with higher CES-D. The physiological metrics of a very low MESOR and resting heart rate (Z-scores of -2.08 and -1.48 respectively) also exhibit a weak positive correlation (0.19) with CES-D, suggesting these physiological characteristics are mildly associated with higher depressive symptoms in this population.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When integrating all available evidence, the compelling strength of the self-reported psychological well-being measures, particularly high self-esteem, low anxiety, high happiness, and high health satisfaction, which are all strongly correlated with lower CES-D scores, outweighs the indicators suggestive of higher depressive symptoms. While the disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and elevated perceived stress are notable concerns and warrant attention, their individual impact on the overall CES-D score is likely mitigated by the robust protective factors observed across multiple domains. The correlations associated with factors pointing to a higher CES-D score are generally weaker (e.g., for stress, napping, and physiological metrics) or from a single strong clinical indicator (PSQI) without a direct CES-D correlation provided for this specific measure. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

18111,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of potential concern related to emotional well-being and perceived stress. Elevated trait anxiety is observed, with a STAI score of 48.0, placing the individual 0.66 standard deviations above the mean, a factor strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (r=0.81). Concurrently, perceived stress is markedly high, with a PSS score of 28.0, 1.74 standard deviations above the population mean, which correlates moderately with CES-D (r=0.28). Self-reported happiness is notably low (Z-score -1.61, r=-0.46), suggesting a diminished sense of well-being. Furthermore, self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.31) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71), implying that lower self-esteem is associated with increased depressive symptoms. Trust levels are slightly above average (Z-score 0.18, r=-0.41), which could be a mitigating factor against higher depressive symptoms, though this is outweighed by other indicators.

Sleep quality appears to be significantly compromised, as indicated by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59), classifying the participant as having disturbed sleep. Objective Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes, which is average (Z-score 0.1). However, the variability in sleep duration is slightly elevated (113 minutes, Z-score 0.27), and this greater variability correlates moderately with higher CES-D scores (r=0.2). A median sleep start time of 01:19:30 suggests a late sleep schedule. A notably high frequency of daily napping (0.27 naps/day, Z-score 2.27) is observed, correlating moderately with higher CES-D scores (r=0.2). This pattern of disturbed and fragmented sleep, despite adequate total duration, aligns with the subjective report. Physical health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39), suggesting a general decrement in perceived physical well-being.

Regarding daily behaviors, the participant reports above-average weekly consumption of beer, wine, and liquor. Exercise frequency is moderately above average for both exercising alone and with others, though participation in sports is reported as ""not at all"" (Z-score -1.09). Engagement in certain recreational activities shows notable deviations: internet usage is higher than average (2-3 hours/day, Z-score 0.85) and moderately correlates with higher CES-D (r=0.25), while listening to music is less frequent than average (Z-score -0.72) and also moderately correlates with higher CES-D (r=0.26). Reading and sedentary hobbies are reported as ""not at all,"" suggesting a limited range of quiet, independent activities. Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicates a dampened and somewhat less regular circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score -1.4) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.95) are below average, suggesting less day-to-day consistency in physiological patterns. The amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is significantly lower than average (Z-score -1.48), indicating a reduced range between peak and trough heart rates, which may reflect diminished physiological robustness or activity modulation. The acrophase, or peak activity time, is observed relatively late at 5:40 PM. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals a significant physiological activation late in the evening, with heart rate 20.14 beats per minute above the mesor between 8-9 PM (Z-score 1.85), representing a high level of arousal compared to peers during this period. This contrasts with significantly lower activity during the early afternoon (e.g., 2-3 PM, -4.74 bpm, Z-score -2.17).

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
A substantial body of evidence suggests that the participant's CES-D score is likely in the top 50% of the study population. Self-reported measures strongly indicate elevated psychological distress. The participant's STAI score, indicative of trait anxiety, is 0.66 standard deviations above the mean and exhibits a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81). Similarly, perceived stress is significantly high (Z-score 1.74), correlating positively with CES-D (r=0.28). Happiness is markedly low (Z-score -1.61), with a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.46). Lower than average self-esteem (Z-score -0.31) shows a strong negative correlation (r=-0.71), aligning with higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor, as evidenced by a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep. Objective wearable data further supports sleep disturbances, showing a significantly higher frequency of napping (Z-score 2.27) and increased variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.27), both of which correlate positively with CES-D scores (r=0.2). Furthermore, key circadian rhythm parameters are indicative of dampened physiological function; the heart rate circadian amplitude is significantly lower than average (Z-score -1.48), suggesting reduced physiological vigor. Daily activity patterns show elevated internet usage (Z-score 0.85, r=0.25) and decreased engagement in listening to music (Z-score -0.72, r=0.26), which are both positively correlated with CES-D, potentially reflecting increased passive entertainment or reduced engagement in previously enjoyable activities. Finally, the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals a pronounced physiological activation late in the evening (8-9 PM, Z-score 1.85), which could contribute to sleep difficulties or sustained arousal associated with depressive or anxious states.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
Few indicators strongly suggest a CES-D score in the bottom 50%. The participant reports slightly above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.18), which negatively correlates with CES-D (r=-0.41), potentially a mitigating factor. Objective sleep duration is within the average range (7 hours 16 minutes, Z-score 0.1), and heart rate parameters such as Mesor and Resting Heart Rate are close to the population average (Z-scores -0.39 and 0.01 respectively), showing only weak correlations with CES-D. While the consistency of sleep start time is slightly higher (lower standard deviation, Z-score -0.31), this metric paradoxically shows a positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.22), implying that more consistent sleep start times might be associated with higher CES-D, which contradicts a protective interpretation.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the evidence, the numerous and strong indicators of psychological distress, disturbed sleep, dampened physiological rhythms, and potentially unhelpful behavioral patterns substantially outweigh the few, weaker indicators that might suggest lower depressive symptomatology. The confluence of elevated trait anxiety, high perceived stress, low self-reported happiness, lower self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep quality, objectively observed frequent napping and sleep duration variability, dampened heart rate circadian amplitude, and late evening physiological arousal provides a compelling picture of an elevated depressive symptom burden. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top 50% of the study population.

59097,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"The participant’s multimodal data reveal a complex profile characterized by notable internal psychological distress coexisting with robust objective physiological regulation and high functional capacity in several key areas.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

From a psychological perspective, the participant reports elevated trait anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 47.0, which is classified as anxious and falls above the population mean (Z-score 0.56). This measure exhibits a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, subjective happiness is significantly below the population average (Z-score -1.61), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.31) and correlates strongly negatively (-0.71) with CES-D. Although perceived stress is reported as lower than the population average (Z-score -0.44), this is a complex finding given its positive correlation with CES-D (0.29). Interpersonal trust is also reported as below average (Z-score -0.78), correlating negatively (-0.41) with CES-D. Despite these indicators of internal distress, academic performance remains consistently high, as evidenced by GPAs ranging from 3.6 to 3.69, and satisfaction with physical health is average.

Regarding sleep patterns and circadian rhythms, subjective reports diverge from objective wearable data. The participant reports disturbed sleep quality according to the PSQI (Score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), indicating perceived difficulties. However, objective Fitbit data show a significantly above-average median sleep duration of 8 hours and 23 minutes (Z-score 1.5). Furthermore, both sleep duration and sleep start times (median 01:07:45) exhibit low variability (standard deviations of 74 minutes and 38 minutes, respectively, with Z-scores of -0.62 and -0.99), suggesting a regular and consistent, albeit late, sleep schedule. The participant also reports not taking naps (Z-score -0.86). Heart rate-derived circadian metrics reveal a highly regular and consolidated physiological rhythm, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.33), low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.52), and strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.23). The heart rate circadian rhythm also displays a high amplitude (Z-score 1.28), indicating a pronounced physiological distinction between active and rest periods, with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring in the late afternoon (4:49 PM). The average heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.78) is slightly elevated, while resting heart rate is average (Z-score 0.05). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest rates observed during the early morning hours (2-5 AM), aligning with sleep, and highest rates in the late morning to early afternoon (10 AM-3 PM).

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant reports above-average alcohol consumption for both beer (Z-score 1.01) and wine/liquor (Z-score 0.94), but no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are mixed, with above-average participation in sports (Z-score 0.91) but below-average frequency for exercising alone or with others (Z-scores -0.43 and -0.17, respectively). Social engagement is notable, with above-average time spent socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95). Other daily recreational habits, such as watching TV, internet usage, reading, and sedentary hobbies, are around or slightly above average, while video game usage and listening to music are somewhat below average.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents several strong indicators suggestive of an elevated CES-D score. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 47.0, Z-score 0.56, classified as anxious) is a significant factor, bolstered by a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Subjective happiness is markedly low (Current happiness 2.0, Z-score -1.61), a direct measure of anhedonia or low mood, which correlates moderately negatively (-0.46) with CES-D. Self-esteem is slightly below average (Z-score -0.31) and shows a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D. Furthermore, the participant reports disturbed subjective sleep quality as per the PSQI (Score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), a common symptom associated with depressive symptomatology. Below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.78), correlating negatively (-0.41) with CES-D, also aligns with a more pessimistic or withdrawn psychological stance.

**Evidence for Low/Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, there are several factors that would typically suggest a lower depressive symptom burden. The participant reports below-average perceived stress (PSS score 20.0, Z-score -0.44), which, despite its population-level positive correlation with CES-D (0.29), indicates less self-reported stress for this individual. Objective wearable data demonstrate remarkably robust sleep patterns, including significantly above-average median sleep duration (8 hours 23 minutes, Z-score 1.5) and very low variability in both sleep duration and sleep start times (Z-scores -0.62 and -0.99, respectively). These objective sleep metrics and strong, regular physiological circadian rhythms (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high amplitude, high 24-hour autocorrelation) are generally considered protective factors against depression. However, their correlations with CES-D in this dataset are negligible to weak (e.g., median sleep duration correlation -0.02, interdaily stability -0.01). The participant also maintains strong academic performance (high GPA) and demonstrates above-average social engagement with friends (Z-score 0.95), behaviors often associated with functional coping and resilience.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits impressive objective physiological regulation, functional coping mechanisms (e.g., high GPA, social engagement), and reports lower perceived stress than average, the direct and strongly correlated psychological indicators of distress are highly prominent. The very low subjective happiness, elevated trait anxiety, below-average self-esteem, and disturbed subjective sleep quality represent significant internal psychological distress. These indicators are more directly reflective of the constructs measured by the CES-D scale, and their correlations with CES-D are substantially stronger than those for the objective physiological metrics or perceived stress. The perceived psychological burden, as evidenced by these primary self-report measures, outweighs the objectively positive behavioral and physiological markers in predicting the overall depressive symptom burden. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence from the most salient and strongly correlated psychological measures, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely higher than the median.

24833,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"The participant presents a complex profile characterized by notable psychological strengths and behavioral engagement alongside significant physiological and subjective sleep disturbances. Self-report measures indicate a robust psychological well-being, including notably low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.82) and higher-than-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score = 0.82). Both of these traits are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study population, suggesting significant protective factors against depressive symptomatology. Further reinforcing this pattern, the participant reports lower-than-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.44) and higher-than-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.8), both of which are also favorably correlated with lower depressive scores. Academically, a consistently high GPA reflects effective functioning. Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in exercise both alone and with others, as well as sports, at frequencies above the population average. Recreational habits are varied, including above-average watching of TV/videos and listening to music, alongside average levels of socializing and reading. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer, wine, and liquor, is reported at an above-average frequency, although these activities show minimal correlation with CES-D scores.

Despite these psychological and behavioral strengths, several indicators suggest areas of challenge, particularly concerning sleep and physiological regulation. The participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score = 7.0, Z-score = 0.13), a common correlate of mood disturbances. Objective sleep data from wearables shows a slightly below-average median sleep duration (6 hours 55 minutes) and a notably late median sleep start time (02:10 AM), although the variability in these metrics is within the average range. More profoundly, the participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythm exhibits significant disruption. Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -1.98) and Autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = -1.79) are markedly low, indicating highly irregular day-to-day physiological patterns. Intradaily Variability (Z-score = 0.46) is above average, suggesting fragmented activity and rest cycles within days. Furthermore, the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (Z-score = -1.58) is notably low, pointing to a flattened physiological response curve with less distinct differences between peak and trough activity throughout the day. These circadian disruptions are accompanied by an elevated Mesor (Z-score = 0.4) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = 0.78), indicating a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activity.

Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further elucidates the physiological state. The participant exhibits relatively elevated heart rates during early morning hours (e.g., 3-5 AM, with Z-scores up to 1.56), suggesting a reduced physiological drop during typical sleep or resting periods compared to the population average. In contrast, certain daytime intervals (e.g., 1-3 PM, 7-8 PM) show lower-than-average heart rates. This pattern of attenuated rhythm amplitude, elevated baseline heart rate, and physiological arousal during early morning hours, combined with self-reported sleep disturbance, points towards a potential chronic disruption in recovery and physiological regulation. Psychologically, despite the many strengths, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53), a metric that negatively correlates with CES-D scores. These findings collectively suggest a person with considerable psychological resources and active engagement, yet experiencing persistent physiological and subjective sleep challenges, potentially contributing to lower happiness levels.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The strongest evidence suggesting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) comes from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. The notably low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -0.82) is very strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.81), indicating that lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, high self-esteem (RSES Z-score = 0.82) shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71). The participant also reports lower-than-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.44), which is positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.28), implying that lower stress levels would predict lower CES-D scores. High health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.8) and consistent, above-average exercise engagement are additional factors generally associated with improved mood and well-being, further supporting a lower depressive symptom burden.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, several factors point towards a potentially higher CES-D score. The participant's self-reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score = 7.0) is a notable concern, as sleep disturbances are frequently co-occurring symptoms of depression. Lower-than-average self-reported happiness (Z-score = -0.53) also correlates negatively with CES-D (r = -0.46), suggesting this could contribute to higher depressive symptoms. From a physiological perspective, the significant disruptions in circadian rhythm, including markedly low Interdaily Stability (Z-score = -1.98), low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = -1.79), and low amplitude (Z-score = -1.58) of heart rate, suggest physiological dysregulation often observed in mood disorders. The elevated Mesor (Z-score = 0.4) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = 0.78), with positive correlations to CES-D (r = 0.19 each), also indicate a state of chronic physiological arousal that could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits notable physiological and sleep disturbances that are often associated with elevated depressive symptoms, the strength and directness of the self-reported psychological protective factors are highly compelling. The very low trait anxiety and high self-esteem are exceptionally strong indicators that predict lower CES-D scores, with correlation coefficients (0.81 and -0.71, respectively) that are substantially higher than those observed for the physiological metrics. While the physiological dysregulation and disturbed sleep could manifest as general distress or other health issues, their impact on the core depressive symptoms measured by the CES-D appears to be significantly mitigated by the participant's robust psychological coping resources and positive self-perception. The overall weight of evidence, particularly from the highly predictive self-report measures of anxiety and self-esteem, strongly suggests a lower depressive symptom burden.

84502,18.0,0.7461139896373057,"The participant presents a mixed profile of psychological well-being and lifestyle habits. Self-report measures indicate several strengths: the participant reports being ""not anxious"" with a STAI score (Z=-0.33) below the population mean, and possesses above-average self-esteem (Z=0.4) and health satisfaction (Z=0.72). Interpersonal trust is also notably high (Z=0.83). Regarding lifestyle, substance use is reported as minimal across all categories (Z-scores ranging from -0.11 to -1.3). The participant engages frequently in exercise, particularly with others (Z=1.23), and moderately alone (Z=0.32). Recreational habits lean away from passive digital consumption, with ""Do not do"" reported for watching TV/videos (Z=-1.25), video games (Z=-0.56), and sedentary hobbies (Z=-0.96). However, self-reported happiness is below average (Z=-0.53), and perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z=0.38). Notably, despite high levels of exercise, self-reported socializing with friends is below average (Z=-0.62).

Sleep patterns reveal a significant discrepancy between objective and subjective measures. Objectively, wearable data indicates a healthy median sleep duration of 7 hours and 31 minutes (Z=0.41), which is above the population average. The participant also demonstrates consistent sleep timing with a below-average standard deviation for sleep start times (Z=-0.39), suggesting a regular sleep schedule. Furthermore, the participant reports no daily naps (Z=-0.86). In contrast, the subjective Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z=1.52) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" classifying their sleep quality as significantly poorer than most of the study population and commonly indicative of clinically significant sleep disturbance. Sleep duration variability is average (Z=0.18).

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicates a robust and regular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.55, Z=1.16) is significantly above average, and the 24-hour Autocorrelation (0.42, Z=0.81) is also high, both suggesting a highly consistent daily rhythm in heart rate. Intradaily Variability (0.55, Z=0.03) is average, indicating typical fluctuations within the day. The participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 67.03 bpm, Z=-0.94) and resting heart rate (52.6 bpm, Z=-0.66) are both below the population average, potentially reflecting good cardiovascular fitness. The circadian amplitude (12.41, Z=0.53) is above average, indicating a clear difference between peak and trough heart rate activity. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs at 4:08 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a characteristic pattern: deep troughs during early morning sleep (e.g., -22.19 bpm between 5-6 AM), a steady increase through the morning, and pronounced peaks in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 25.93 bpm between 4-5 PM, Z=2.54; 24.73 bpm between 5-6 PM, Z=2.07). These peaks represent significantly elevated physiological arousal during these hours, consistent with the acrophase, and a return to near mesor levels by late evening.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a relatively low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is present in several key areas. The participant's low anxiety (STAI Z=-0.33) and high self-esteem (Z=0.4) are strongly associated with lower CES-D scores, given their respective correlations of 0.82 and -0.71. Additionally, above-average trust (Z=0.83) and health satisfaction (Z=0.72) are moderately linked to lower CES-D. Healthy lifestyle choices, such as frequent exercise (especially with others, Z=1.23) and minimal substance use, generally correlate with better mental health outcomes. Objectively, sleep patterns show good duration (Z=0.41) and high regularity in sleep start times (Z=-0.39), with less variability in sleep start times and no napping correlating with lower CES-D. Furthermore, the robust and regular circadian rhythm, characterized by high Interdaily Stability (Z=1.16) and a lower resting heart rate (Z=-0.66), typically aligns with better overall well-being, even though direct correlations with CES-D are weak for these specific metrics.

Conversely, significant evidence suggests a relatively high CES-D score (top 50th percentile). The most salient factor is the participant's PSQI score of 10.0 (Z=1.52), which indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" and is explicitly classified as clinically significant. Poor subjective sleep quality is a very strong indicator and component of depressive symptomatology. Moreover, the participant reports below-average happiness (Z=-0.53), which, given its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), suggests a higher depressive symptom burden. Slightly above-average perceived stress (Z=0.38) and a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.28) also contribute to this interpretation. While objective sleep duration is adequate, the subjective experience of sleep disturbance points to an underlying issue.

Synthesizing the evidence, while the participant exhibits several protective factors such as low anxiety, high self-esteem, healthy exercise habits, and objective sleep regularity, the profound subjective sleep disturbance indicated by the PSQI score (10.0, Z=1.52) is a critical concern. This level of disturbed sleep is a powerful predictor of psychological distress and is often intertwined with depressive symptoms. The combination of significantly poor subjective sleep quality, below-average happiness, and elevated perceived stress outweighs the protective factors when considering overall depressive symptom burden. Therefore, it is most likely that the participant's CES-D score would fall within the top half of the study population distribution.

78783,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several notable patterns. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is slightly above the study population mean (Score: 43.0, Z-score: 0.17), correlating strongly and positively with CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting a higher propensity for anxiety is associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Conversely, self-esteem (RSES Score: 39.0, Z-score: 0.11) and interpersonal trust (Score: 3.67, Z-score: 0.83) are slightly above average, which typically correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.71 and -0.41, respectively), acting as potential protective factors. Despite these, subjective happiness (Score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61) is notably low, deviating significantly below the population mean and correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.46). Similarly, satisfaction with physical health is considerably below average (Score: 2.78, Z-score: -1.11), also correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.39). Perceived stress, however, is slightly below the mean (Score: 21.0, Z-score: -0.17), showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). This suggests a complex interplay where some internal resources (self-esteem, trust) are present, but overall subjective well-being and health satisfaction are significantly compromised, alongside elevated trait anxiety.

Sleep patterns present as a particularly salient area of concern for this participant. Self-reported sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI, is categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep"" (Score: 8.0, Z-score: 0.59), indicating significant difficulties. Objective wearable data corroborate and expand upon this, revealing a highly irregular sleep schedule. The median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours 52 minutes (Z-score: -0.39), with a late median sleep start time of 02:51:39 AM. Critically, sleep start time exhibits extremely high variability (Standard Deviation: 173 minutes, Z-score: 1.99), and sleep duration also shows high variability (Standard Deviation: 151 minutes, Z-score: 1.13). Both these variability metrics correlate positively with CES-D scores (0.22 and 0.20 respectively), strongly indicating that an unstable sleep schedule is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Further, the participant reports a very high frequency of napping (Mean Daily Naps: 0.26, Z-score: 2.23), which correlates positively with CES-D (0.21) and may suggest compensatory sleep behaviors or persistent fatigue. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show slightly below-average interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.41) and slightly above-average intraday variability (Z-score: 0.24), consistent with a less stable and more fragmented physiological rhythm, though these specific metrics show negligible correlation with CES-D in this dataset.

Behavioral and physiological activity patterns offer further insights. The participant demonstrates a commendable engagement in physical exercise, reporting exercising alone 'Three times a week or more' (Z-score: 1.07) and participating in exercise with others and sports '1-2 times a week' (Z-scores: 0.53 and 0.91 respectively). These behaviors generally correlate negatively with CES-D, suggesting a potential protective role. Social engagement is also reported as above average ('Socializing with Friends' 2-3 hours, Z-score: 0.95). However, significant time is allocated to sedentary screen-based activities, particularly video games ('31 minutes an hour', Z-score: 1.71) and watching TV/videos/movies ('31 minutes an hour', Z-score: 0.64), while reading is reported as 'Do not do' (Z-score: -0.67). From a physiological perspective, the participant exhibits a relatively low resting heart rate (52.75 BPM, Z-score: -0.64) and a below-average MESOR (69.68 BPM, Z-score: -0.58), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. However, the hourly heart rate deviation from the mesor reveals an atypical pattern of physiological arousal. Specifically, the heart rate shows a significant elevation late at night (10-11 PM deviation from mesor: +16.47, Z-score: 1.58), indicating higher-than-average physiological activity compared to peers during a period that should typically be associated with winding down. This elevated late-night arousal, especially given the very late median sleep start time, suggests potential difficulty in physiological de-escalation prior to sleep, aligning with the observed sleep disturbances. The nadir (lowest point) of heart rate deviation from mesor occurs late into the morning (e.g., 6-7 AM, 7-8 AM), consistent with a delayed chronotype or very late sleep schedule.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence suggesting a relatively low or average depressive symptom burden includes the participant's above-average self-esteem (Z-score: 0.11), above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83), and slightly below-average perceived stress (Z-score: -0.17). These factors are generally associated with lower CES-D scores, with self-esteem showing a strong negative correlation (-0.71) and trust a moderate negative correlation (-0.41). Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical exercise (Z-scores up to 1.07), a behavior consistently linked to improved mood and lower depressive symptoms, as reflected by the negative correlations with CES-D (-0.09 to -0.23). Above-average social engagement (Z-score: 0.95) could also be a protective factor. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.64) and MESOR (Z-score: -0.58) suggest good cardiovascular fitness, which may contribute to overall resilience.

Conversely, substantial evidence points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports significantly low subjective happiness (Z-score: -1.61) and considerably low health satisfaction (Z-score: -1.11), both of which correlate negatively with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively), implying their low values are indicative of higher depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.17), and critically, it exhibits a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), suggesting a significant contribution to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, sleep quality is profoundly disturbed. The PSQI score of 8.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance. Wearable data reveals extremely high variability in sleep start times (Z-score: 1.99) and duration (Z-score: 1.13), alongside a very late median sleep start time (02:51:39 AM). These sleep irregularities correlate positively with CES-D (0.22 and 0.20). The high frequency of napping (Z-score: 2.23) also correlates positively with CES-D (0.21), potentially reflecting fatigue or compensatory behaviors. Physiologically, an unusually high heart rate deviation late at night (10-11 PM, Z-score: 1.58) suggests elevated physiological arousal during a period when the body should be winding down, consistent with difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep and generally poor sleep hygiene.

While the participant demonstrates protective factors such as good self-esteem, trust, perceived stress management, high exercise engagement, and good cardiovascular fitness, these are substantially outweighed by several critical indicators of elevated depressive symptomatology. The extreme deviations in subjective well-being (happiness and health satisfaction) and the pervasive, highly irregular, and objectively disturbed sleep patterns are particularly impactful, given their strong correlations with CES-D. The high trait anxiety further supports an elevated burden. The physiological arousal observed late at night provides objective support for the subjective experience of disturbed sleep. Considering the magnitude and prevalence of these negatively correlated factors, particularly the severe sleep disruptions and low subjective happiness, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

25197,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a complex psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety and stress alongside diminished happiness. Their STAI-Trait score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86) classifies them as anxious, a trait that correlates strongly and positively with CES-D scores (r=0.82). Similarly, perceived stress is notably high, with a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 25.0 (Z-score 0.92), correlating moderately with CES-D (r=0.28). Subjective happiness is below the population average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), which aligns with higher CES-D scores given its negative correlation (r=-0.46). Counteracting these indicators of distress, the participant reports exceptionally high self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 44.0, Z-score 0.82), exceeding the typical scale maximum, and high satisfaction with their physical health (score 6.44, Z-score 1.63). Both high self-esteem (r=-0.71) and health satisfaction (r=-0.39) demonstrate strong negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting these factors may act as protective elements against depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is average (Z-score -0.14), with a modest negative correlation to CES-D (r=-0.41). Academically, the participant consistently maintains an excellent GPA across academic semesters, suggesting sustained cognitive function and academic engagement.

Sleep quality is subjectively reported as disturbed, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13), exceeding the common threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance. Objectively, Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 34 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.77). Despite this reduced duration, the participant demonstrates consistent sleep patterns, evidenced by a low standard deviation in sleep duration (61 minutes, Z-score -0.91) and sleep start times (56 minutes, Z-score -0.58), along with no reported daily naps. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data reveals a robust daily pattern with an above-average amplitude (12.77, Z-score 0.64), indicating clear physiological fluctuations between peak and trough activity. The acrophase, or peak activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:02 PM. The participant also shows below-average Mesor (average heart rate of 67.71 bpm, Z-score -0.85) and Resting Heart Rate (52.4 bpm, Z-score -0.68), pointing to a generally lower baseline cardiovascular tone. Intradaily variability (Z-score -0.53) is slightly lower than average, suggesting less abrupt physiological changes within a day, while interdaily stability is typical. The consistent but short sleep duration, coupled with subjective sleep disturbance, suggests potential challenges with sleep quality or restorative aspects despite a relatively stable sleep schedule and robust circadian rhythm.

The participant's daily activities demonstrate moderate engagement across various domains. Substance usage includes alcohol (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week), which is above the population average (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94, respectively), but reports no use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise habits are consistent, with 1-2 times a week for both solitary and group exercise, which is near or slightly above average for the study population. Recreational habits indicate minimal engagement with TV/videos/movies (Do not do, Z-score -1.25) and moderate engagement in video games, internet usage, listening to music, socializing, reading, and sedentary hobbies. Physiological arousal patterns derived from hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate a typical diurnal rhythm with distinct troughs during sleep and peaks during wakefulness. Notably, a pronounced peak in heart rate deviation is observed between 3-4 PM (38.33 bpm above mesor, Z-score 5.3), indicating a period of exceptionally high physiological arousal during the late afternoon. This is significantly higher than the average, suggesting a specific time of intense physical or mental activity or stress. Other hourly values demonstrate a sharp increase in activity in the morning (e.g., 9-10 AM, Z-score 1.04) and a gradual decrease towards evening and night.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several significant indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Their STAI-Trait score is high (Z-score 0.86, classified as ""anxious""), and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.82), indicating that higher anxiety is predictive of higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, their Perceived Stress Scale score is significantly elevated (Z-score 0.92), with a positive, albeit weaker, correlation to CES-D (r=0.28). Subjective happiness is notably low (Z-score -0.53), and a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.46) suggests that this reduced happiness contributes to a higher depressive symptom burden. Furthermore, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score of 7.0 signifies disturbed sleep, exceeding the clinical threshold, a condition frequently comorbid with and contributing to depressive symptoms. While objective sleep duration is merely shorter than average (Z-score -0.77), the subjective disturbance reinforces the presence of sleep-related distress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, the participant demonstrates remarkable strengths that typically correlate with lower depressive symptoms. Their self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is exceptionally high (score 44.0, Z-score 0.82), which is strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.71). This suggests that high self-esteem acts as a substantial protective factor. Similarly, the participant reports very high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 1.63), a trait that also correlates negatively with CES-D (r=-0.39). Academic performance is consistently excellent, maintaining a high GPA, which generally indicates functional coping and engagement despite other challenges. From the wearable data, Mesor (average heart rate, Z-score -0.85) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score -0.68) are both below average, and their positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.19) suggests these lower values might be associated with a reduced depressive burden. Additionally, the regularity of sleep patterns (low standard deviation for sleep duration and start time, both Z-scores below -0.5) and lower intradaily heart rate variability (Z-score -0.53) could be interpreted as indicators of stable physiological regulation, generally associated with better mental health outcomes, though their correlations with CES-D are weak (0.2, 0.22, -0.06 respectively).

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The participant presents a mixed profile with compelling evidence pointing in both directions. However, when weighing the cumulative impact and magnitude of the correlations, the indicators for elevated depressive symptomatology appear to be more prominent in their direct psychological and experiential impact. The high anxiety (STAI), elevated perceived stress (PSS), and notably low subjective happiness (Happy) are direct reflections of emotional and cognitive distress, and their correlations with CES-D are substantial. While the exceptionally high self-esteem and health satisfaction are significant protective factors, they do not entirely negate the presence of these internalizing symptoms. The disturbed subjective sleep quality further underscores a general state of distress that often accompanies depressive states. The observed physiological patterns, such as the unusually high peak in heart rate deviation in the afternoon, suggest periods of intense arousal that could be indicative of underlying stress or psychological demand, even if its direct correlation with CES-D is not strongly adverse. Given the participant's significant scores on measures directly tapping into anxiety, stress, and happiness, which collectively represent key facets of depressive experience, it is more likely that their overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a complex profile encompassing several adaptive psychological and behavioral patterns, alongside some areas that may warrant attention in the context of depressive symptomatology. Psychologically, the individual reports elevated trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 47.0 (Z-score 0.56), indicating an anxious classification. This measure demonstrates a strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D scores in the study population. Despite this, self-reported happiness (score 4.0, Z-score 0.55) is above the population average and correlates moderately negatively with CES-D (-0.46). Perceived stress levels are notably low (PSS score 19.0, Z-score -0.71), and health satisfaction is above average (score 5.0, Z-score 0.55), with both correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.28 and -0.39, respectively). Self-esteem (RSES score 37.0, Z-score -0.17) is close to the population mean, although lower self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Subjective sleep quality is reported as good, with a PSQI score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26), indicating better sleep quality than most peers.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, engaging in exercise alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), exercising with others 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.53), and participating in sports three times a week or more (Z-score 1.58). This consistently high level of physical activity is generally associated with positive mental health outcomes. Furthermore, the participant reports no usage of beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs, indicating an absence of substance use. However, engagement in daily recreational habits appears limited. The participant reports ""Do not do"" for watching TV/videos/movies, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, with these metrics showing Z-scores substantially below the population mean. Socializing with friends is also notably low, reported as 16-30 minutes per day (Z-score -1.41), suggesting restricted social interaction.

Physiological data derived from wearables reveal a pattern of robust sleep and a well-structured circadian rhythm. The median sleep duration is significantly longer than the population average, at 8 hours and 49 minutes (Z-score 2.03), while sleep duration variability is within the typical range. The circadian rhythm, as indicated by heart rate data, displays typical interdaily stability (Z-score -0.24) and intradaily variability (Z-score 0.39), with an acrophase (peak activity) at 2:42 PM, reflecting a consistent daily rhythm. The Mesor (69.51, Z-score -0.61) and resting heart rate (54.9, Z-score -0.39) are both below the population mean, which is generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates clear and robust physiological activation patterns throughout the day. Marked increases in cardiovascular activity are observed during the late morning (peaking around 9-10 AM with a deviation of 19.65, Z-score 2.06) and a significant resurgence in the late afternoon (4-5 PM, deviation of 15.83, Z-score 1.05), followed by appropriate declines to a resting state during nocturnal hours. These patterns suggest a regular and dynamic engagement with daily activities and a healthy physiological recovery period.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile, including the median, representing relatively low or average depressive symptomatology):**

The participant demonstrates several robust indicators typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI score 4.0, Z-score -1.26), which is significantly better than average and correlates negatively with CES-D. Objective sleep duration is substantially longer than the population mean (8 hours 49 minutes, Z-score 2.03). Self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55), and perceived stress levels are below average (Z-score -0.71), both indicating a positive self-assessment of emotional well-being. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is elevated (Z-score 0.55). Behaviorally, the participant maintains a high level of physical activity and sports engagement (multiple Z-scores well above average), and reports no substance use, all of which are protective factors against depressive symptoms. Physiologically, a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.39) suggests good cardiovascular health, and the well-regulated hourly heart rate patterns indicate healthy daily physiological arousal and recovery. Collectively, these factors represent a strong profile of resilience and adaptive health behaviors commonly linked to lower CES-D scores.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile, representing relatively elevated depressive symptomatology):**

The most salient indicator for a potentially higher CES-D score is the elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 47.0, Z-score 0.56), which is classified as anxious and shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.82). This suggests that anxiety proneness is a significant psychological characteristic for this individual that typically co-occurs with depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant reports significantly low engagement in socializing with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-score -1.41) and a general absence of participation in various passive recreational activities such as watching TV, listening to music, reading, or other sedentary hobbies. While not strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset, these behavioral patterns could reflect aspects of social withdrawal or reduced interest in typically pleasurable activities, which are common manifestations of depressive states.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The participant presents a complex profile with competing indicators. The elevated trait anxiety, a significant psychological vulnerability, stands out due to its strong positive correlation with CES-D. Furthermore, limited social engagement and a general lack of participation in passive recreational activities could be interpreted as potential behavioral correlates of anhedonia or social withdrawal. However, these are counterbalanced by a robust array of adaptive psychological and behavioral patterns. The participant exhibits excellent subjective and objective sleep quality and duration, very high levels of physical activity, low perceived stress, elevated self-reported happiness, and strong health satisfaction. Physiologically, indicators of good cardiovascular health and a well-regulated circadian rhythm are evident.

When weighing the evidence, the protective factors, particularly the combined strength of healthy sleep, high physical activity, and positive self-reported emotional and physical health, appear to outweigh the risk posed by elevated trait anxiety and limited social/recreational engagement. While trait anxiety is a potent predictor, the participant's comprehensive engagement in health-promoting behaviors and positive self-perceptions across several domains suggest an overall resilience that would likely mitigate the expression of elevated depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite the presence of elevated trait anxiety, the overall burden of depressive symptoms is more likely to fall within the lower range of the study population.

The participant exhibits a profile characterized by notable psychological vulnerability, particularly in the domain of anxiety and stress, alongside distinct patterns of sleep and circadian rhythm irregularity. Self-report data indicate a significantly elevated level of trait anxiety (STAI score 50.0, Z-score 0.86), which is classified as ""anxious"" and demonstrates a strong positive correlation with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). This is further compounded by a very high level of perceived stress (PSS score 29.0, Z-score 2.01). Interpersonal trust is notably low (score 2.33, Z-score -1.74), a factor that is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting that lower trust is associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Additionally, health satisfaction is below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.95), also moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, implying a potential link between physical health dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant reports average self-esteem (score 39.0, Z-score 0.11) and slightly above-average happiness (score 4.0, Z-score 0.55), which are generally considered protective factors and correlate negatively with depressive symptoms. The participant also demonstrates relatively high engagement in physical exercise, particularly exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), though the correlation with CES-D is weak. Daily recreational habits show elevated internet usage (Z-score 0.85) but lower engagement in passive activities like watching TV and reading, and also reduced time socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62). Substance use, specifically beer, wine, and liquor, is slightly above average, but correlations with CES-D are negligible.

Sleep patterns, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, point towards disturbance and irregularity. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13) indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep. Objective Fitbit data corroborate this with a slightly below-average median sleep duration of 6 hours and 57 minutes (Z-score -0.29). More critically, the participant exhibits considerably high variability in nightly sleep duration (standard deviation 159 minutes, Z-score 1.32) and above-average variability in sleep start time (standard deviation 99 minutes, Z-score 0.36), both of which show positive correlations with depressive symptoms. The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:44:30. These objective sleep irregularities, alongside a slightly above-average frequency of napping (Z-score 0.12), collectively suggest a disrupted and inconsistent sleep schedule.

Physiological markers derived from wearable heart rate data further illustrate patterns of circadian rhythm dysregulation. The participant displays slightly reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.57) and weaker 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.7), suggesting less consistent day-to-day physiological rhythms compared to the study population. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also slightly below average (Z-score -0.52), indicating a less pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rate activity. The calculated acrophase for heart rate activity is relatively late at 5:03 PM. Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a distinct pattern of cardiovascular activity peaking in the late evening, specifically between 7-8 PM, where the deviation is significantly higher than that of the population mean for that hour (Z-score 1.03). This late surge in physiological arousal, coupled with a late median sleep start time, suggests a shifted or delayed overall daily activity rhythm, potentially contributing to the observed sleep disturbances. The participant's resting heart rate is below average (53.0 bpm, Z-score -0.61), which is generally considered healthy, though its correlation with CES-D is weakly positive.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The participant's profile presents several strong indicators suggestive of an elevated depressive symptom burden. The most salient evidence is the significantly high self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score 50.0, Z-score 0.86), which carries a very strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (r=0.81). This indicates that individuals with higher trait anxiety are highly likely to report more depressive symptoms. Further supporting this is the participant's very high perceived stress (PSS score 29.0, Z-score 2.01). While its correlation with CES-D is weaker, it nonetheless contributes to a challenging psychological state. The extremely low interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.74) is also a significant factor, showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D, meaning lower trust is associated with higher depressive scores. Below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.95) similarly correlates negatively with CES-D, suggesting a potential link between dissatisfaction with health and increased depressive symptomatology.

In terms of sleep, the self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0) exceeds the clinical cutoff for sleep disturbance and is frequently comorbid with depression. Objective Fitbit data reveal substantial irregularity in sleep patterns, with very high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.32) and above-average variability in sleep start time (Z-score 0.36), both of which are positively correlated with higher CES-D scores. The slightly increased frequency of napping (Z-score 0.12) also aligns with a higher CES-D score. Furthermore, the wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics, indicating reduced interdaily stability (Z-score -0.57) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.7), suggest a less robust and consistent physiological rhythm, which can be a correlate of mood dysregulation. The late acrophase and prominent late-evening heart rate peak also point to a disrupted physiological rhythm.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Counterbalancing these indicators are some protective factors. The participant reports average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.71). This suggests that maintaining average self-esteem may serve as a buffer against depressive symptoms. Similarly, the slightly above-average self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46), indicating a potential mitigating influence. The participant also engages in regular exercise, particularly exercising alone (Z-score 1.07), which is generally associated with better mental health, even if its direct correlation with CES-D in this study is weak. While median sleep duration is slightly below average, it is not excessively short (6 hours 57 minutes, Z-score -0.29). The participant's resting heart rate is also relatively low (Z-score -0.61), indicative of good cardiovascular health, though its correlation with CES-D is weakly positive.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence strongly points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The significant psychological distress indicated by very high trait anxiety, high perceived stress, low trust, and dissatisfaction with health, all show correlations consistent with higher CES-D scores. These robust self-report findings are further supported by objective and subjective indicators of substantial sleep dysregulation and disrupted circadian rhythms, which are commonly associated with depressive states. While the participant benefits from average self-esteem, slightly elevated happiness, and good exercise habits, the magnitude and number of indicators associated with higher depressive symptoms appear to outweigh these protective factors. Given the population's 50th percentile CES-D score is 11.0, the cumulative weight of high anxiety, stress, interpersonal difficulties, poor sleep quality, and physiological rhythm irregularity makes it highly probable that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

67192,32.0,0.9300518134715026,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a pattern of self-reported psychological distress and diminished well-being. Notably, they report elevated chronic anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.65), very high levels of perceived stress (PSS Z-score 2.55), and significantly low current happiness (Z-score -1.61). These metrics consistently align with substantial psychological burden. Furthermore, self-esteem is reported as below the population average (Z-score -0.73), and satisfaction with physical health is considerably low (Z-score -2.03). Interpersonal trust is also markedly low (Z-score -2.39). The strong positive correlations of STAI and PSS with CES-D, and negative correlations of Self-Esteem, Happiness, Trust, and Health Satisfaction with CES-D, suggest these factors are closely associated with depressive symptomatology within this study population.

Sleep patterns show a discrepancy between subjective experience and objective duration. While the participant self-reports disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 7.0, indicating 'Disturbed Sleep'), wearable data indicates an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes (Z-score 0.1). However, further analysis of objective sleep metrics reveals a late median sleep start time (01:15:29) and above-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score 0.59). Additionally, the participant shows a slightly elevated frequency of daily napping (Z-score 0.7). These elements collectively suggest potential disruptions in sleep timing and structure, which may contribute to the self-reported sleep disturbance despite adequate overall duration.

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicates a generally elevated baseline cardiovascular state. The participant exhibits a high resting heart rate (Z-score 1.62) and a significantly high mesor (mean heart rate across the day, Z-score 2.01), both suggesting a heightened state of physiological arousal compared to the study population. Although interdaily stability (Z-score 0.91) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.23) are above average, indicating a relatively consistent daily heart rate rhythm, the acrophase (time of peak cardiovascular activity) occurs relatively late in the day (5:12 PM). Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further reveal a particularly notable increase in cardiovascular activity during late evening hours, peaking between 10-11 PM (Z-score 1.55), which is considerably higher than the population average for that period. This pattern suggests elevated physiological engagement or arousal extending into the late night.

Behaviorally, the participant engages in moderate levels of physical activity, reporting exercising alone and with others 1-2 times per week, though they do not participate in sports. Recreational habits are characterized by significant engagement in digital media, including above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (Z-score 0.85), with notably high engagement in video games (Z-score 2.47). Socializing with friends is also a prominent activity, reported at more than 4 hours daily (Z-score 2.53), indicating very high social interaction relative to the study population. Conversely, engagement in reading and sedentary hobbies is low. Academically, the participant's GPA shows a decline from 3.17 to 2.02 across academic semesters, suggesting potential challenges in academic functioning.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):** The participant's self-reported data provides substantial evidence for elevated depressive symptomatology. They exhibit high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.65, classified as 'anxious') and very high perceived stress (PSS Z-score 2.55), both of which are strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores. Concurrently, they report very low happiness (Z-score -1.61), low self-esteem (Z-score -0.73), very low health satisfaction (Z-score -2.03), and very low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.39), with all these metrics negatively correlated with CES-D. The PSQI score of 7.0 indicates self-reported 'Disturbed Sleep'. Physiologically, an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.62) and mesor (Z-score 2.01) suggest chronic physiological arousal, which can co-occur with psychological distress. The pronounced elevation in heart rate in the late evening (10-11 PM, Z-score 1.55) could indicate difficulty with relaxation or nocturnal restlessness. Furthermore, the observed decline in academic performance (GPA from 3.17 to 2.02) may reflect functional impairment often associated with depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):** Wearable data indicates an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 16 minutes, suggesting adequate sleep quantity. The participant also demonstrates above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.91) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.23) in heart rate rhythms, implying some degree of physiological regularity. Behaviorally, the participant reports very high levels of socializing with friends (Z-score 2.53) and moderate engagement in exercise, which can be protective factors against severe depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:** While some metrics suggest average sleep duration and a degree of physiological rhythmicity, as well as high social engagement, these are heavily outweighed by the comprehensive and consistent indicators of significant psychological distress, diminished well-being, and physiological arousal. The strong correlations of the self-report measures (STAI, PSS, Self-Esteem, Happiness, Health Satisfaction, Trust) with CES-D scores, coupled with disturbed subjective sleep and declining academic performance, collectively point towards an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The overall pattern of data strongly suggests that the participant is experiencing substantial psychological and functional challenges that are characteristic of higher depressive symptomatology.

The participant exhibits several psychological characteristics that generally align with lower depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (Score: 33.0, Z-score: -0.82), which is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in the study population (r=0.81), indicating that lower trait anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is above average (Score: 41.0, Z-Score: 0.4), a factor strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71), suggesting it serves as a protective factor. Perceived stress is also below the population mean (Score: 20.0, Z-Score: -0.44), and while moderately correlated with CES-D (r=0.28), this lower score would suggest reduced depressive burden. Interpersonal trust is notably high (Score: 4.0, Z-Score: 1.47), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.41). However, self-reported happiness is somewhat below average (Score: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46), suggesting a potential area of concern. Health satisfaction is also slightly below average (Score: 3.67, Z-score: -0.45) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39). Regarding subjective sleep quality, the participant's PSQI score of 6.0 is categorized as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" yet their Z-score of -0.33 indicates they report *less* sleep disturbance than the average participant, suggesting a relatively better subjective sleep experience compared to peers. Academic performance, as indicated by GPA, is consistently high, particularly the most recent 3.8.

The participant's behavioral profile reveals a mix of typical and somewhat atypical patterns. Substance usage for beer and wine/liquor is above average (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), though these behaviors show very weak correlations with CES-D in the population. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent, which is typical for the population. Exercise habits indicate a preference for solitary activity, with exercise alone reported as frequent (Z-score 1.07). Conversely, engagement in exercise with others and sports is notably low (Z-scores -1.58 and -1.09 respectively). The lack of social exercise is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.24), which could be a subtle indicator of elevated depressive symptomatology if this absence is linked to social withdrawal. Daily recreational habits include average time spent watching TV/videos and socializing with friends, but notable engagement in reading (Z-score 1.3), and minimal or no engagement in video games, internet usage, or listening to music compared to the population mean. Most of these recreational habits show weak correlations with CES-D.

Wearable data reveals a well-regulated circadian rhythm with some distinct features. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0) and a robust heart rate amplitude (Z-score 1.29), indicating consistent daily patterns and clear physiological distinctions between active and resting states. The Acrophase, or peak physiological activity, is observed relatively late in the day at 5:00 PM. Resting heart rate is notably low (Value: 50.8, Z-score: -0.87), which typically correlates with lower CES-D (r=0.19), implying this is a protective factor against higher depressive symptoms. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a clear diurnal pattern. Heart rates are significantly below the mesor during early morning hours (e.g., 5-8 AM, Z-scores ranging from -1.56 to -1.42), reflecting deep resting periods. Conversely, heart rates show substantial elevation above the mesor during active daytime hours, particularly peaking in the mid-morning (10-11 AM, Z-score 1.68), early afternoon (2-3 PM, Z-score 2.23), and notably extending into the late evening (8-10 PM, Z-scores 2.1 and 2.14). These late evening elevations suggest prolonged physiological arousal or activity patterns that extend later into the day/night compared to the average population, which could potentially impact sleep onset or quality, even though the overall subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score) is not poor.

Fitbit data indicates the participant maintains an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes (Z-score 0.02), which is within healthy ranges. Both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit lower than average variability (Sleep Duration SD Z-score: -0.86; Sleep Start Time SD Z-score: -0.43). This suggests a consistent and regular sleep schedule. The median sleep start time is 01:44:30. Despite the subjective PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the objective Fitbit measures suggest stability and adequate duration. The relatively early morning trough in heart rate combined with a somewhat late acrophase and elevated late-evening heart rates might indicate a tendency to be active or physiologically aroused later in the day, potentially pushing the sleep onset later, but without significantly compromising overall duration or regularity. The participant also reports slightly higher than average daily naps (Z-score 0.7), which could compensate for perceived sleep deficits or reflect a preference for polyphasic sleep.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To assess whether the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores, a holistic analysis of the multimodal data is necessary, considering the population's median CES-D score of 11.5.

Evidence suggesting a **lower or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile)** is substantial. The participant exhibits significantly low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.82), which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81). This suggests a reduced predisposition to experiencing anxiety, a common comorbidity with depression. High self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.4) is another strong protective factor, being highly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71). Additionally, the participant reports lower than average perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.44), which is positively correlated with CES-D (r=0.28). High interpersonal trust (Z-score: 1.47) and a notably low resting heart rate (Z-score: -0.87) further contribute to this pattern, as both are negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.41 and r=0.19 respectively, with lower RHR indicating lower CES-D). Sleep parameters from Fitbit show consistent and adequate sleep duration and low variability, and while the PSQI is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the corresponding Z-score (-0.33) indicates subjective sleep quality is *better* than the population average for disturbed sleepers. These psychological and physiological indicators collectively point towards a profile less congruent with elevated depressive symptomatology.

Conversely, there is some evidence that could suggest a **higher CES-D score (top 50th percentile)**, though less prominent. The participant's self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score: -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46), implying this could be a contributing factor to higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.45) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39). Behavioral patterns indicate a lack of participation in social exercise (Z-score: -1.58), a factor moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.24), which could imply a higher CES-D burden. Physiologically, the presence of markedly elevated heart rates extending into the late evening (e.g., 8-10 PM Z-scores exceeding 2.0) suggests prolonged physiological arousal or activity patterns, which while not directly correlated with CES-D, could potentially impact overall well-being or contribute to subclinical distress.

In conclusion, a holistic analysis of the available evidence indicates that the psychological and physiological factors most strongly correlated with CES-D in the study population (namely trait anxiety, self-esteem, and perceived stress) consistently align with a profile of lower depressive symptomatology for this participant. While there are some indicators of reduced happiness, lower health satisfaction, and late evening physiological arousal, these are generally less robust or numerous than the indicators for lower depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, the participant's CES-D score is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
67177,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a pattern of psychological and behavioral characteristics that suggest a significant level of distress and potential depressive symptomatology. Self-reported measures indicate elevated anxiety, with a STAI score of 46 (Z-score 0.46), which is classified as anxious and shows a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores in the study population. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (score 31, Z-score -1.01), carrying a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, suggesting a reduced sense of self-worth often associated with depressive states. This individual also reports very low levels of happiness (Current score 2.0, Z-score -1.61), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), indicating a pervasive negative mood. Furthermore, perceived stress is elevated (score 25, Z-score 0.92), and health satisfaction is considerably low (score 2.67, Z-score -1.2), both of which are often co-occurring features in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. A notable decline in academic performance, evidenced by a GPA drop from 3.25-3.38 to 1.9, provides a concrete behavioral indicator of potential functional impairment during the academic semester.

Behavioral patterns extracted from self-reports reinforce this picture. The participant reports not engaging in any form of exercise, either alone or with others, with very low Z-scores (Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93; Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58), reflecting a significant lack of physical activity. Social engagement is also notably low, with the participant reporting only 31 minutes per hour socializing with friends (Z-score -0.62). Conversely, there is relatively high engagement in more solitary or passive recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28) and internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85). The absence of substance use (all categories reported as ""Not at all"") indicates no apparent reliance on substances, but the overall lack of engagement in health-promoting activities is salient. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is disturbed (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), a common complaint in depression, even though wearable data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 54 minutes (Z-score -0.35), which is only slightly below the population mean.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveals a state of elevated baseline physiological arousal, with an elevated resting heart rate (65.2 bpm, Z-score 0.84) and a higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor 82.08, Z-score 1.11). While these metrics show weak correlations with CES-D, they can be indicative of chronic stress or poor cardiovascular fitness. Despite this elevated baseline, the participant demonstrates relatively robust circadian rhythmicity in heart rate data, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.24) and high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.4), suggesting a consistent daily physiological routine. Intradaily variability is low (Z-score -0.74), indicating less fluctuation within the day. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest rates during early morning sleep hours and peaks in the late afternoon/early evening (Acrophase 4:34 PM), which is a relatively late peak. While the regularity of the circadian rhythm might generally be considered adaptive, its presence alongside pervasive self-reported distress and elevated physiological arousal suggests that this regularity does not mitigate the participant's psychological burden.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence points towards the participant likely having an elevated CES-D score. The STAI score, indicating an anxious disposition (Z-score 0.46), exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D, making it a primary indicator. Similarly, the participant's significantly low self-esteem (Z-score -1.01) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), aligning with higher depressive symptoms. The very low self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) and low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.2), both negatively correlated with CES-D, further support this. High perceived stress (Z-score 0.92) is also a common concomitant of depression. The reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7), significant academic decline (GPA drop to 1.9), and extremely low engagement in physical exercise (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93) are all behavioral manifestations frequently associated with depressive states. The participant's limited social interaction (Z-score -0.62 for socializing) also contributes to this pattern. Physiologically, elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 0.84) and mesor (Z-score 1.11) suggest increased physiological arousal, often seen in conditions involving psychological stress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score is comparatively limited. The participant reports no substance use across multiple categories, which could be considered a protective factor against some maladaptive coping mechanisms. Wearable data indicates strong regularity in circadian rhythms, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.24) and high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score 1.4), alongside low intradaily variability (Z-score -0.74). This suggests a consistent physiological daily pattern. Sleep duration, while slightly below average (Z-score -0.35), is not severely curtailed, and sleep start time is consistent. These markers of circadian robustness could be indicative of a relatively stable physiological routine, which might be associated with lower depressive burden in some contexts.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering the totality of the data, the overwhelming majority of indicators, particularly the self-reported psychological measures and key behavioral patterns, strongly align with elevated depressive symptomatology. The very strong correlations between CES-D and the participant's scores on STAI, Self-Esteem, and Happiness, all of which are unfavorable, are particularly compelling. While certain physiological metrics like circadian rhythm regularity might suggest some underlying physiological consistency, they do not sufficiently counteract the profound distress, negative self-perception, functional impairment, and lack of engagement in health-promoting activities indicated by the self-report and other behavioral data. The participant's profile is consistent with an individual experiencing a significant burden of depressive symptoms within the study population.

Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI score 23.0, Z-score -1.81) is exceptionally low relative to the study population, a factor strongly and positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Similarly, self-esteem (score 50.0, Z-score 1.66) is remarkably high, inversely correlated with depressive symptoms (r=-0.71). Perceived stress (PSS score 15.0, Z-score -1.8) is also very low, and current self-reported happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64) is notably high. These combined psychological indicators, all showing strong protective patterns, suggest a substantially lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Counteracting these positive indicators, the participant reports low satisfaction with physical health (score 2.67, Z-score -1.2, r=-0.4) and slightly below-average interpersonal trust (score 3.0, Z-score -0.46, r=-0.41), factors that are moderately associated with higher depressive symptomatology.

Regarding sleep, the participant reports disturbed subjective sleep quality based on a PSQI score of 7.0, although this score falls within the average range for the study population (Z-score 0.13). Objective wearable data, however, paint a more stable picture of sleep habits. Median sleep duration (7 hours 25 minutes, Z-score 0.3) is average, and there is notably low variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation 76 minutes, Z-score -0.57) and sleep start time (standard deviation 50 minutes, Z-score -0.72). Lower variability in sleep duration and start time typically correlates with lower depressive symptoms. However, the participant reports a higher frequency of daily napping (0.18 naps/day, Z-score 1.21), which shows a weak positive correlation with depressive symptoms.

Analysis of heart rate data reveals a robust and well-regulated physiological circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits above-average interdaily stability (value 0.53, Z-score 1.0) and a high amplitude (value 16.28, Z-score 1.78), indicating consistent day-to-day patterns and clear distinction between activity and rest phases. Resting heart rate (54.4 bpm, Z-score -0.45) is slightly below average, generally associated with better cardiovascular fitness and weakly correlated with lower CES-D scores. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show typical strong diurnal variation, with significant drops during nighttime hours (e.g., -26.44 at 5-6 am) and pronounced peaks during daytime activity, particularly in the evening (e.g., +27.64 at 6-7 pm, Z-score 2.62). The magnitude of these daytime peaks suggests a higher-than-average level of physiological arousal or activity during these periods. The general consistency and distinctiveness of these physiological rhythms, particularly the strong negative deviation during sleep and the high evening peak, are weakly associated with lower depressive symptoms in the study population.

Behavioral habits further contextualize the participant's profile. Substance usage (alcohol and drugs) is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories, with correspondingly low Z-scores, indicating minimal to no engagement in these activities. Exercise habits are mixed, with below-average frequency in exercising alone or with others, but above-average engagement in sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91). Recreational habits demonstrate a high level of engagement, with notably high Z-scores for watching TV/videos/movies (2.54), video games (1.71), listening to music (1.6), reading (2.28), and especially socializing with friends (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.53). While some of these activities are sedentary and show weak positive correlations with CES-D, the extremely high engagement in socializing with friends suggests strong social connectedness, which is generally protective against depression.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial and pervasive across self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits exceptionally low trait anxiety (Z-score -1.81, r=0.81), very high self-esteem (Z-score 1.66, r=-0.71), very low perceived stress (Z-score -1.8, r=0.28), and very high self-reported happiness (Z-score 1.64, r=-0.46). All of these strong indicators are significantly associated with lower depressive symptomatology in the study population. Additionally, objective sleep data indicate lower-than-average variability in sleep duration and start time, which are weakly correlated with lower CES-D. Resting heart rate is slightly below average, also weakly suggesting lower CES-D. High levels of social engagement further support a positive well-being profile.

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is less pronounced. The participant reports subjective disturbed sleep (PSQI score 7.0), although objectively sleep duration and regularity are average or better. Lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.2, r=-0.4) and slightly lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46, r=-0.41) are moderately associated with higher CES-D. Furthermore, a higher frequency of napping (Z-score 1.21, r=0.22) weakly correlates with higher depressive symptoms.

Considering the totality of the evidence, the highly significant and strong indicators from the psychological survey data (anxiety, self-esteem, stress, happiness) overwhelmingly suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. While some factors like health dissatisfaction, lower trust, and napping point towards potentially higher CES-D, their correlations are generally weaker or their Z-scores less extreme compared to the robust indicators pointing in the opposite direction. The objective wearable data largely confirm healthy physiological and behavioral patterns, with stable sleep rhythms and robust circadian regulation. Therefore, the participant’s overall profile strongly indicates a CES-D score likely falling within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

49497,49.0,1.0,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a psychological profile notably characterized by elevated anxiety and significantly diminished self-esteem. Their STAI score of 64.0 (Z-score 2.24) places them in an anxious classification, indicating a level of trait anxiety considerably higher than the study population average. This high anxiety demonstrates a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem is remarkably low, with a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 22.0 (Z-Score -2.28), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.7). Further evidence of psychological distress includes self-reported happiness at 2.0 (Z-Score -1.61), indicating markedly below-average happiness, which is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (-0.45). Perceived stress levels are somewhat elevated (PSS score 24.0, Z-score 0.65), showing a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). Additionally, the participant reports lower interpersonal trust (Score 2.5, Z-Score -1.42), which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.4), while maintaining an above-average satisfaction with physical health (Score 5.0, Z-score 0.55).

Sleep patterns exhibit considerable objective and subjective disturbance. The participant's PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-Score 1.05) indicates clinically significant poor sleep quality, placing them above the population average. Fitbit data further substantiates this, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes (Z-Score -0.85), which is below average. More critically, both sleep onset and duration demonstrate high variability; the median sleep start time of 01:14:03 is coupled with an exceptionally high standard deviation of 204 minutes (Z-Score 2.65), and sleep duration itself has high variability (Standard Deviation 148 minutes, Z-Score 1.06). These objective irregularities align with compromised heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics: Interdaily Stability is notably low (0.21, Z-Score -1.65), suggesting a lack of day-to-day regularity, and the Amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly blunted (5.95, Z-Score -1.56), indicating a less pronounced physiological rhythm. The Acrophase, or peak cardiovascular activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 3:05 PM. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveals typical reductions during sleep hours but also an atypical surge in heart rate activity during the late evening (10-11 PM, deviation 14.61, Z-score 1.29), suggesting late-night physiological arousal or activity.

The participant's behavioral patterns include several striking deviations from population norms, particularly concerning substance use and social engagement. Recreational drug use (1-2 times a week, Z-Score 5.44) and non-prescribed drug use (1-2 times a month, Z-Score 13.79) are extraordinarily high compared to the study population. While alcohol consumption is also elevated, it is less extreme. Regarding physical activity, the participant frequently exercises alone (three times a week or more, Z-Score 1.07) and engages in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-Score 0.91), both above average. However, there is a complete absence of exercising with others (Z-Score -1.58), highlighting a preference for solitary physical activity. Socializing with friends is reported at a significantly low frequency (16-30 minutes, Z-Score -1.41), reinforcing a pattern of reduced social interaction. Conversely, internet usage is notably high (3-4 hours, Z-Score 1.52), indicating substantial time spent online.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50% of the study population) is robust and multifaceted. The participant exhibits extremely high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 2.24) and profoundly low self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score -2.28), which are strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.81 and -0.70, respectively). Additionally, self-reported happiness is significantly below average (Z-score -1.61, correlation -0.45), and perceived stress is elevated (Z-score 0.65, correlation 0.28). Subjective sleep quality is clinically disturbed (PSQI Z-score 1.05), supported by objective Fitbit data showing highly variable sleep onset and duration (Sleep Start Time SD Z-score 2.65, Sleep Duration SD Z-score 1.06). Further, indicators of disrupted circadian rhythms, such as low Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.65) and blunted heart rate Amplitude (Z-score -1.56), are frequently observed in individuals with mood disorders, even if their direct correlations with CES-D in this dataset are modest. Behavioral patterns like reduced social engagement (Socializing with Friends Z-score -1.41, Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58) and very high internet usage (Z-score 1.52, correlation 0.24) also align with common features of elevated depressive symptoms.

Conversely, evidence that might suggest a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50% of the study population) is considerably weaker. The most notable conflicting data point is the participant's above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.55), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41), implying higher health satisfaction is linked to lower depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant reports above-average engagement in solitary exercise and sports, which show weak negative correlations with CES-D. While substance use is extremely high (e.g., recreational drugs Z-score 5.44, non-prescribed drugs Z-score 13.79), the direct correlations between these specific behaviors and CES-D scores in this dataset are very weak (0.11 and 0.04 respectively). Most other wearable metrics, while indicating physiological disruption, exhibit weak correlations with CES-D.

Holistically, the overwhelming weight of evidence, particularly from the highly impactful and strongly correlated psychological measures of trait anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness, points towards a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The widespread sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, along with reduced social engagement, further reinforce this pattern. Although the participant reports above-average health satisfaction, this single indicator is insufficient to counteract the multitude of strong, converging factors suggesting elevated depressive symptomatology. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top 50% of the study population distribution.

33785,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant presents with a profile characterized by notable trait anxiety and lower self-esteem, which are strong indicators for potential depressive symptomatology. The self-reported Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score of 56.0 places the participant at 1.45 standard deviations above the population mean, classified as ""anxious,"" and this measure exhibits a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores in the study population. Concurrently, the participant's Self-Esteem score of 32.0 is 0.87 standard deviations below the mean, indicating lower self-worth, which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71). Despite these vulnerabilities, the participant reports above-average current happiness (Z=0.55) and lower-than-average perceived stress (Z=-0.71). Satisfaction with physical health is also slightly above average (Z=0.38), and academic performance, as reflected by GPA, has been consistently strong. These latter factors, while not as strongly correlated with CES-D as anxiety and self-esteem, suggest areas of relative psychological resilience or effective daily coping strategies.

Regarding sleep and circadian patterns, the participant self-reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with a score of 7.0, although this score is close to the population average (Z=0.13) among peers. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals an average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes (Z=0.18). Notably, the standard deviation of sleep start times is below average (Z=-0.75), indicating a relatively consistent bedtime routine. Circadian rhythm analysis derived from heart rate data points to a highly regular physiological pattern; Intradaily Variability is very low (Z=-2.08), suggesting minimal fluctuations in heart rate within a typical day, while Autocorrelation at 24 hours is higher than average (Z=1.06), reinforcing a strong day-to-day rhythmicity. The Mesor (mean heart rate) and resting heart rate are both within the average range for the study population. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 4:49 PM. This combination of subjective sleep disturbance but objective regularity in sleep timing and physiological rhythms suggests a structured daily routine, yet with underlying subjective sleep dissatisfaction.

The participant's daily activities reveal a preference for solitary and sedentary forms of recreation. While participation in exercise alone is frequent (more than three times a week, Z=1.07), engagement in exercise with others and sports is low. Recreational habits show significantly higher-than-average time spent on video games (1-2 hours, Z=2.47) and sedentary hobbies (2-3 hours, Z=2.01), along with above-average time dedicated to reading (16-30 minutes, Z=1.3). Socializing with friends falls within the average range, and substance usage is generally low. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reflects a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest heart rates occurring during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -23.45 bpm deviation from mesor between 5-6 AM), consistent with a healthy nocturnal dip. Heart rate gradually increases through the day, reaching its peak physiological activity relative to the population average in the late evening (e.g., 14.02 bpm deviation from mesor between 10-11 PM, Z=1.19), before declining towards sleep. This elevated heart rate in the late evening, while part of a consistent daily pattern indicated by low intradaily variability, suggests heightened physiological arousal during this time relative to the population.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. The STAI score, indicating significantly higher trait anxiety (Z=1.45), has a very strong positive correlation (r=0.81) with CES-D scores. This suggests that the participant's chronic anxiety proneness is highly associated with a greater burden of depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant's lower self-esteem (Z=-0.87) shows a very strong negative correlation (r=-0.71) with CES-D, indicating that reduced self-worth is also strongly linked to higher depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the PSQI classification of ""Disturbed Sleep,"" even if its Z-score is average, points to a subjective experience of sleep difficulties, which is a common symptom domain in depression.

**Evidence for Low/Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest a potentially lower or average CES-D score. The participant reports above-average current happiness (Z=0.55) and below-average perceived stress (Z=-0.71), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.46 and r=0.29, respectively, though the latter correlation is positive for stress, indicating lower stress predicts lower CES-D). High health satisfaction (Z=0.38, r=-0.4) also points in this direction. Behaviorally, regular solitary exercise (Z=1.07) is generally considered a protective factor. Objectively, wearable data indicates good consistency in sleep start times (Z=-0.75) and strong overall circadian rhythmicity (e.g., high 24-hour autocorrelation, Z=1.06; average interdaily stability). These objective markers of routine and rhythm are often associated with better mental health outcomes.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits several protective behavioral and objective physiological factors such as consistent sleep patterns, regular exercise, higher happiness, and lower perceived stress, the profound impact of high trait anxiety and low self-esteem on CES-D scores cannot be overlooked. The correlations of STAI (0.81) and Self-Esteem (-0.71) with CES-D are substantially stronger than those of the mitigating factors. These core psychological vulnerabilities are central to depressive symptomatology and significantly increase the likelihood of experiencing a higher burden of depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite some areas of resilience, the strong indicators of anxiety and low self-esteem suggest that the participant's overall CES-D score would likely place them in the upper half of the study population distribution.

33009,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"The participant’s psychological and behavioral data reveal a multifaceted profile, encompassing both protective factors and indicators of potential distress, particularly concerning sleep, affect, and physiological regulation.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a complex interplay of traits and current affect. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is within the average range (Score 40.0, Z-score -0.13), and perceived stress (PSS) is notably below the population average (Score 19.0, Z-score -0.71). Self-esteem is slightly above average (Score 40.0, Z-score 0.26). These factors, when considered in isolation, are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden (STAI correlation 0.81, PSS correlation 0.28, Self-Esteem correlation -0.71). However, the participant reports below-average current happiness (Current 3.0, Z-score -0.53), lower interpersonal trust (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.46), and reduced satisfaction with physical health (Score 3.67, Z-score -0.45). These latter metrics have negative correlations with CES-D, indicating that lower scores on happiness, trust, and health satisfaction are generally associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Assessment of sleep reveals a notable disparity between subjective experience and objective physiological metrics. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, with a Z-score of 0.13, indicates subjectively disturbed sleep, classifying the participant as experiencing sleep disturbance. Paradoxically, wearable data show objectively favorable sleep characteristics: the median sleep duration is nearly eight hours (7 hours 54 minutes, Z-score 0.89), and both sleep duration and sleep start times demonstrate significantly less variability than the population average (Z-scores -1.03 and -0.61, respectively). The participant also reports no daily naps, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.86). Despite these markers of objective sleep regularity, heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics suggest significant physiological dysregulation. The participant exhibits below-average interdaily stability (Value 0.35, Z-score -0.49) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Value 0.27, Z-score -0.45), coupled with above-average intradaily variability (Value 0.62, Z-score 0.53), indicating a less consistent and more erratic daily physiological pattern. Furthermore, the heart rate rhythm's amplitude is significantly lower than average (Value 7.95, Z-score -0.92), suggesting a flattened daily cardiovascular arousal profile. The mesor (mean heart rate) is also below average (Value 68.76, Z-score -0.71), and the acrophase (peak activity) occurs relatively late in the day at 3:51 PM.

The participant's daily activity profile indicates a tendency toward higher levels of structured exercise and lower engagement in passive recreational activities compared to peers. Exercise, both alone and with others, is reported at frequencies above the population average (Z-scores 0.32 and 0.53). Conversely, time spent on activities like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, and sedentary hobbies is notably below average. Internet usage and socializing with friends are within typical population ranges. Regarding substance use, the participant reports consuming wine or liquor ""1-2 times a week,"" which is a significantly higher frequency than the population average (Z-score 0.94). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further elucidates daily physiological arousal patterns. During typical sleep hours (e.g., 2-7 AM), heart rate dips substantially, often to a greater degree than observed in the peer population (positive Z-scores for negative deviations, e.g., -14.75 at 4-5 AM with Z-score 0.56). Throughout the day, periods of elevated heart rate consistent with activity are observed, but there are also distinct periods in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 4-5 PM, 7-10 PM) where the participant's heart rate activity is markedly lower than peers (e.g., 9-10 PM value of 0.25 with Z-score -1.38). This suggests intermittent periods of reduced physiological arousal or activity during the latter part of the day, consistent with the observed flattened heart rate amplitude.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile)**

Several factors suggest the participant may experience a lower-than-average depressive symptom burden. The participant's self-esteem is above average (Z-score 0.26), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71), indicating higher self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is notably below average (Z-score -0.71), and its positive correlation with CES-D (0.28) implies lower stress is linked to lower CES-D. Trait anxiety is average (Z-score -0.13), and its strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) suggests an average anxiety level would correspond to an average or lower CES-D score. Objectively, sleep patterns are highly regular and of sufficient duration; both sleep duration and sleep start time standard deviations are significantly lower than the population mean (Z-scores -1.03 and -0.61, respectively), and their positive correlations with CES-D (0.20 and 0.22) indicate that greater regularity is associated with lower CES-D scores. The participant also engages in above-average exercise and spends less time on passive recreational activities, habits generally associated with better mental well-being and, by correlation, lower CES-D scores. Furthermore, the mean heart rate (Mesor) is below average (Z-score -0.71), and its positive correlation with CES-D (0.19) suggests a lower mean heart rate is associated with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile)**

Conversely, several indicators point towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53), lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46), and reduced satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.45). These metrics all show moderate negative correlations with CES-D (happiness -0.46, trust -0.41, health satisfaction -0.39), meaning lower scores are associated with higher CES-D. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed by the PSQI (score 7.0, Z-score 0.13). Critically, several heart rate-derived circadian rhythm parameters suggest physiological dysregulation. The amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is significantly flattened (Z-score -0.92), and this metric has a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.10), implying a flatter rhythm is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Additionally, interdaily stability (Z-score -0.49) is below average, and intradaily variability (Z-score 0.53) is above average, indicating a less robust and more erratic physiological rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart rate data reveal pronounced periods of significantly lower physiological arousal in the late afternoon and evening compared to peers, which could be indicative of reduced energy or engagement patterns often associated with depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion**

The participant presents with a mixed profile. While positive factors such as high self-esteem, low perceived stress, above-average exercise, and objectively regular sleep patterns are present and generally indicative of lower depressive symptomology, these are counterbalanced by significant concerns. The combination of self-reported lower happiness, trust, and health satisfaction, coupled with subjectively disturbed sleep, points to internal experiences of distress. Most notably, the objective physiological data reveal significant circadian rhythm disturbances, specifically a markedly flattened heart rate amplitude, lower interdaily stability, and higher intradaily variability. The negative correlation of heart rate amplitude with CES-D is particularly relevant, suggesting this physiological flattening is associated with higher depressive symptom burden. The observed periods of reduced physiological arousal in the late afternoon/evening further support this pattern of dysregulation. Considering the strength of the physiological indicators of dysregulation and the consistent self-reports of lower overall well-being, these factors appear to collectively outweigh the positive self-reported psychological traits and objective sleep regularity in the context of depressive symptom burden. Therefore, it is more likely that the participant's CES-D score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

96184,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant sleep and circadian rhythm dysregulation, alongside indications of psychological distress and reduced social engagement. Self-reported measures indicate a propensity towards anxiety (STAI score 42.0, Z-score 0.07), elevated perceived stress (PSS score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), and lower current happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) compared to the study population. Sleep quality is self-reported as disturbed (PSQI score 7.0, Z-score 0.13), a finding robustly supported by wearable data. Conversely, self-esteem (score 40.0, Z-score 0.26) and health satisfaction (score 4.33, Z-score 0.05) appear to be within or slightly above the average range for the population.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates markedly low social engagement, spending only 16-30 minutes socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41). There is also a notable absence of engagement in several common recreational activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and reading, as indicated by ""Do not do"" responses and corresponding negative Z-scores. Exercise frequency, both alone and with others, is also below average. This pattern of reduced social interaction and diminished engagement in diverse leisure activities, especially when activities like listening to music are relatively high (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.67), may reflect a shift towards solitary or passive pursuits. Substance use is reported as minimal or non-existent, placing the participant well below average for all categories.

Objective wearable data reveal severe sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. The participant’s median sleep duration is notably short at 5 hours 27 minutes (Z-score -2.16), indicating significantly less sleep than peers. More strikingly, sleep patterns are highly erratic: the standard deviation of sleep duration is extremely high at 359 minutes (Z-score 5.88), and the standard deviation of sleep start times is even more pronounced at 422 minutes (Z-score 7.44). This points to an exceptionally unstable sleep schedule. The median sleep start time is very late at 04:42:17, and there is a higher frequency of napping (0.18 daily, Z-score 1.27), possibly as a compensatory mechanism for poor nightly sleep. These metrics collectively depict a profound disruption in the participant's sleep hygiene and consistency.

Further analysis of heart rate derived circadian rhythm metrics corroborates this picture of dysregulation. The participant exhibits very low interdaily stability (0.22, Z-score -1.56) and poor autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.11, Z-score -1.79), indicating a highly irregular and unstructured daily physiological rhythm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also considerably low (6.21, Z-score -1.48), suggesting a dampened distinction between peak and trough physiological activity. The mesor (mean heart rate) is below average (66.59 bpm, Z-score -1.0). The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late at 5:09 PM. Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a tendency for relatively higher heart rates during typical sleeping hours (e.g., 2-5 AM, Z-scores ranging from 1.16 to 1.33 for deviations from mesor) compared to peers. Conversely, during several daytime and evening hours, the heart rate deviations are relatively lower than those of the study population (e.g., 12-1 PM Z-score -1.55, 6-7 PM Z-score -1.03, 8-9 PM Z-score -1.02). This pattern suggests a flattening of physiological arousal, where the contrast between rest and activity periods is less pronounced, potentially reflecting reduced daytime activity or engagement and/or restless sleep.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is substantial and multi-faceted. The participant self-reports elevated anxiety (STAI), stress (PSS), and notably low current happiness, all of which positively correlate with CES-D scores. While self-esteem and health satisfaction are average or slightly above, they are significantly outweighed by objective indicators of severe sleep and circadian rhythm disruption. The exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 5.88) and sleep start times (Z-score 7.44) are particularly striking, with strong positive correlations to CES-D. Similarly, the extremely low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.56) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -1.79) indicate a profoundly disorganized daily rhythm, a common correlate of depressive symptoms. Behavioral patterns, such as significantly reduced social interaction (Z-score -1.41) and low engagement in various recreational activities, align with symptoms of anhedonia and social withdrawal often observed in depression. The subtle physiological patterns from hourly heart rate data, suggesting a dampened distinction between active and rest states, further support a state of general physiological and behavioral dysregulation.

Given the confluence of elevated self-reported psychological distress, objective and severe sleep disturbances, profound circadian rhythm disruption, and reduced behavioral engagement, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is very likely to place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution for CES-D scores. The extreme nature of the sleep and circadian rhythm Z-scores, which are highly correlated with CES-D, provides particularly strong evidence for elevated depressive symptomatology despite some average self-reported protective factors.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile reveals several notable deviations from the study population's average, many of which are strongly associated with depressive symptoms. A significantly elevated trait anxiety score (STAI Z-score = 1.25) indicates greater chronic anxiety, correlating strongly (r = 0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem is remarkably low (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Z-score = -1.85), showing a robust negative correlation (r = -0.70) with CES-D, suggesting profound feelings of self-worth impairment. Self-reported happiness is also considerably below average (Z-score = -1.61, r = -0.46), and both interpersonal trust (Z-score = -1.10, r = -0.41) and overall satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = -0.86, r = -0.39) are lower than typical. While perceived stress is slightly below the population mean (Perceived Stress Scale Z-score = -0.44), this relative calm does not appear to offset the significant distress indicated by other affective and cognitive measures.

Sleep patterns, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, present a complex picture. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (score = 6.0), a score commonly indicating poor sleep quality. However, objective Fitbit data indicates an average median sleep duration of 7 hours 15 minutes (Z-score = 0.09) and notable consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation Z-score = -0.29) and sleep start time (standard deviation Z-score = -0.80). The median sleep start time is notably late at 01:21:45 AM. Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics suggest a highly stable (Interdaily Stability Z-score = 1.16) and regular (Autocorrelation at 24 hours Z-score = 1.15) daily physiological rhythm, with below-average intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.53) indicating less fragmentation within the day. Despite this overall consistency, the acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:26 PM. Furthermore, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. While nocturnal heart rates decrease as expected, there are pronounced elevations in heart rate deviation from the mesor extending late into the evening hours, particularly from 9-11 PM (Z-scores of 1.11 and 1.26 respectively), suggesting sustained and above-average physiological activity or arousal well past typical winding-down periods, which likely contributes to the self-reported sleep disturbance despite objective consistency in duration.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in exercise with others three or more times a week (Z-score = 1.23), a habit negatively correlated with CES-D. Exercise alone is also above average. Alcohol consumption, specifically beer and wine/liquor, occurs 1-2 times a week, placing the participant above the population mean for these behaviors (Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94 respectively), though these habits show very weak correlations with CES-D. The participant reports no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Daily recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos/movies, internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, and engaging in a sedentary hobby, are generally at or slightly above population averages, with notable exceptions being an absence of video game playing or reading. The physiological arousal observed in the late evening could potentially be linked to some of these late-night recreational activities.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several strong indicators for an elevated CES-D score. Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI) is substantially high (Z-score = 1.25), and this measure has a very strong positive correlation (r = 0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem is markedly low (Z-score = -1.85), which is strongly and negatively correlated (r = -0.70) with CES-D. Furthermore, self-reported happiness is significantly below average (Z-score = -1.61, r = -0.46), and both trust (Z-score = -1.10, r = -0.41) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.86, r = -0.39) are lower than peers, all negatively correlating with CES-D. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as disturbed (score = 6.0), a common symptom associated with depression. Physiologically, the presence of above-average heart rate deviations from the mesor during late evening hours (9-11 PM, Z-scores up to 1.26) suggests sustained arousal that could negatively impact sleep and overall well-being, potentially contributing to depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Some aspects of the participant's data suggest potential mitigating factors. Perceived stress is slightly below the population mean (Z-score = -0.44). The participant demonstrates above-average engagement in exercise, particularly with others (Z-score = 1.23), a behavior with a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.24) with CES-D, indicating a potentially protective social and physical activity level. Objective wearable data shows high interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.16) and low intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.53) in heart rate rhythms, suggesting regular daily routines and less fragmented activity, which are generally associated with better health. Additionally, median sleep duration is average, and sleep duration and start time show below-average variability, indicating consistent sleep habits, although correlations with CES-D are weak or counter-intuitive for these specific sleep consistency metrics.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Despite some potentially protective behavioral and physiological consistency metrics, the magnitude and strength of the self-reported psychological distress indicators (high anxiety, very low self-esteem, very low happiness, and disturbed subjective sleep) strongly outweigh these factors. The high correlations of STAI and Self-Esteem scores with CES-D are particularly compelling. The observed physiological arousal extending late into the evening, combined with a late sleep start time, likely contributes to the self-reported sleep disturbance, even with objective sleep duration appearing average. Given the confluence of these strongly correlated and significantly deviated psychological markers, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

59863,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by notably low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, as indicated by a STAI-Trait score of 24.0 (Z = -1.71) and a Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 50.0 (Z = 1.66), respectively. Both measures demonstrate strong correlations with CES-D scores in the study population (0.81 for STAI, -0.71 for Self-Esteem), suggesting a resilient psychological state associated with lower depressive symptom burden. This positive psychological disposition is further supported by a significantly higher self-reported happiness score (Z = 1.64) and below-average perceived stress levels (PSS Z = -0.44), with happiness showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46). Additionally, the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (Z = 1.3), which correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.39), reinforcing a generally positive self-perception and emotional well-being.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a lifestyle associated with positive mental health. Academic performance is consistently strong, with GPAs ranging from 3.7 to 3.82. Engagement in physical activity is notably high, with ""three times a week or more"" for exercising alone (Z = 1.07) and ""1-2 times a week"" for sports (Z = 0.91). Substance use is generally low, except for slightly higher beer consumption (Z = 1.01), which has a negligible correlation with CES-D. Recreational habits reflect engagement in positive leisure activities, including significantly more reading than the population average (Z = 1.3 for 16-30 minutes daily). These behavioral patterns collectively point towards an active and engaged individual, which is typically associated with better overall mental health.

The participant's sleep patterns are generally indicative of good quality and consistency. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is good (Score = 5.0, Z = -0.8), aligning with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 24 minutes. Objective Fitbit data further highlights sleep regularity: both sleep duration (Z = -0.69) and sleep start time (Z = -0.21) exhibit lower than average standard deviations, indicating consistent sleep habits. The absence of daily naps (Z = -0.86) also suggests consolidated nocturnal sleep. From a physiological circadian perspective, the heart rate rhythm demonstrates lower intradaily variability (Z = -1.16) and a higher amplitude (Z = 1.01), signifying a robust and well-structured daily physiological rhythm, which is typically favorable for mental and physical well-being.

In contrast to the largely positive psychological and behavioral indicators, the participant exhibits certain physiological characteristics suggesting an elevated baseline of cardiovascular activity. The overall average heart rate (Mesor = 91.26 bpm, Z = 2.36) and resting heart rate (67.65 bpm, Z = 1.13) are both significantly higher than the study population average. These metrics demonstrate a modest positive correlation with CES-D (0.2), suggesting a potential association between higher physiological arousal and depressive symptoms in the population. Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a significantly elevated heart rate during the 8-9 AM period (Z = 1.21), further contributing to the overall pattern of increased physiological activation throughout the day, even while maintaining a robust circadian rhythm with distinct peaks and troughs.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is extensive and robust across multiple domains. The participant demonstrates exceptionally low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.71) and high self-esteem (Z = 1.66), both of which are strongly correlated with lower CES-D scores (-0.81 and 0.71, respectively, implying the opposite direction for CES-D). High self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64) and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 1.3) also strongly suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant exhibits below-average perceived stress (Z = -0.44), good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = -0.8), and consistent sleep patterns (low standard deviations for sleep duration and start time), all of which are generally associated with better mental health and lower depressive symptomatology. Active engagement in exercise and reading further supports a healthy and adaptive lifestyle.

Conversely, evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is limited primarily to physiological markers of elevated cardiovascular activity. The participant's significantly higher Mesor (Z = 2.36) and Resting Heart Rate (Z = 1.13) are mildly positively correlated with CES-D (0.2). While these physiological measures suggest a state of higher physiological arousal, their correlational strength with CES-D is weak compared to the profound psychological indicators. Despite these elevated heart rate metrics, the robustness of the participant's circadian rhythm (low intradaily variability, high amplitude) suggests a well-regulated, albeit activated, physiological system.

Holistic analysis indicates that the overwhelming evidence from psychological self-report measures and behavioral patterns strongly points towards a low burden of depressive symptoms. The profound deviations from the population mean for trait anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness, in a direction consistently linked to lower depressive symptoms and with strong correlational support, significantly outweigh the mild and weakly correlated physiological markers of elevated heart rate. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's CES-D score falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

22913,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a mixed psychological and behavioral profile. Self-reported measures indicate a relatively low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72) and slightly below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.44), suggesting a generally stable emotional state in these domains. Self-esteem and satisfaction with health are at or near the population average (Self-Esteem Z-score: -0.03; Health Satisfaction Z-score: 0.05). However, the participant reports slightly below-average current happiness (Z-score: -0.53), which correlates moderately negatively with CES-D scores, indicating a potential susceptibility to higher depressive symptomatology in this aspect. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is at a borderline score of 5.0, classifying as ""Good Sleep"" with a Z-score of -0.8, though a score of 5 or above is often indicative of clinically significant sleep disturbance, suggesting this participant is on the threshold.

Physiological data reveal an elevated average heart rate (Mesor Z-score: 1.81) and resting heart rate (RHR Z-score: 0.77), indicating a higher overall physiological baseline compared to the study population. Despite this elevated baseline, the participant exhibits a notably stable and robust circadian rhythm, characterized by significantly low intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.8) and an above-average amplitude (Z-score: 0.84). This suggests a well-defined and consistent physiological pattern throughout the day, with clear differentiation between activity and rest periods, which generally points to good physiological regulation. The hourly mean heart rate deviations confirm this clear diurnal pattern, showing pronounced drops during sleep and consistent elevations during waking hours, with peak activity in the late morning and afternoon.

Fitbit-derived sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 37 minutes, which is significantly above the population average (Z-score: 1.79). This prolonged sleep, coupled with an above-average frequency of daily naps (Z-score: 0.61), could potentially indicate hypersomnia or an increased need for rest, which can be associated with depressive symptoms, even when subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is rated as 'good'. The variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time is average, indicating a consistent sleep schedule overall.

Behavioral habits show notable deviations from the population mean. The participant engages in above-average alcohol consumption (Beer Usage Z-score: 1.01; Wine or Liquor Usage Z-score: 0.94) but abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise frequency is consistently below average across all categories (Exercised Alone Z-score: -0.43; Exercised with Others Z-score: -0.17; Sports Z-score: -1.09). More significantly, engagement in various daily recreational activities is notably low: minimal time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score: -0.62), significantly less internet usage (Z-score: -1.16), and not engaging in listening to music (Z-score: -1.19) or reading (Z-score: -0.67). Socializing with friends is also below average (Z-score: -0.62), while time spent on sedentary hobbies is above average (Z-score: 0.82). This pattern of reduced engagement in typical leisure and social activities, particularly those with moderate positive correlations to CES-D (e.g., internet usage, listening to music), may indicate anhedonia or social withdrawal, which are central features of depressive symptomatology.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is evidence supporting both lower and potentially higher depressive symptomatology, making a definitive classification challenging without the actual CES-D score.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.72) and below-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.44), both of which correlate positively with CES-D, suggesting a lower depressive burden in these areas. Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI score: 5.0, Z-score: -0.8). Physiologically, the circadian rhythm exhibits high stability (Intradaily Variability Z-score: -1.8) and a strong amplitude, indicating a robust internal clock, which is typically associated with better mental health outcomes.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Directly, the participant reports slightly below-average happiness (Z-score: -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D, implying this is a depressive indicator. Physiologically, there is an elevated overall heart rate baseline (Mesor Z-score: 1.81; Resting Heart Rate Z-score: 0.77), which weakly correlates with higher CES-D scores. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 5.0, while classified as ""Good Sleep"" by its Z-score, is at the cutoff for clinically significant sleep disturbance. This is compounded by significantly prolonged objective sleep duration (Z-score: 1.79) and above-average napping, which could indicate hypersomnia or fatigue often seen in depression. Most significantly, the participant shows a consistent pattern of markedly reduced engagement in physical activity (all exercise categories are below average, with Sports at Z-score: -1.09) and various recreational activities (e.g., Internet Usage Z-score: -1.16; Listening to Music Z-score: -1.19; Reading Z-score: -0.67; Socializing with Friends Z-score: -0.62). The observed moderate positive correlations between low engagement in activities like internet usage and listening to music with CES-D strongly suggest that these behavioral patterns align with symptoms of anhedonia and social withdrawal.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits low anxiety and a stable physiological circadian rhythm, the overall pattern of behavioral disengagement across multiple recreational and physical activities is a compelling indicator of depressive symptomatology, specifically anhedonia and withdrawal. This behavioral profile, combined with slightly lower reported happiness, borderline subjective sleep quality (despite long objective sleep duration and increased napping, which can be a depressive symptom), and an elevated physiological arousal baseline, collectively points towards a higher burden of depressive symptoms. The specific negative Z-scores for engagement in key leisure activities, combined with their positive correlations with CES-D, provide strong support for an elevated CES-D score.

48969,42.0,0.9896373056994818,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a notable psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety, diminished self-worth, and pervasive sleep difficulties. Their STAI-Trait score of 59.0 (Z-score 1.75) places them in the anxious classification, a trait strongly correlated with higher depressive symptoms (r=0.81). This heightened anxiety is compounded by significantly low self-esteem, as indicated by an RSES score of 22.0 (Z-score -2.28), which shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.7), implying lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive scores. Furthermore, the participant reports low levels of happiness (Z-score -1.61), moderately correlating with increased depressive symptoms (r=-0.45). Subjective sleep quality is severely compromised, with a PSQI score of 13.0 (Z-score 2.9) classifying their sleep as disturbed. While perceived stress levels are near the population average (PSS score 22.0, Z-score 0.1), their interpersonal trust is slightly below average (Z-score -0.46), which also correlates negatively with CES-D (r=-0.41).

Behaviorally, the participant displays a distinct pattern of social isolation coupled with high engagement in solitary, screen-based leisure activities. Socializing with friends is reported as minimal (15 minutes or less per day, Z-score -2.2), indicating substantial social withdrawal compared to peers. Conversely, participation in watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and internet usage is exceptionally high (all exceeding 4 hours daily, with Z-scores ranging from 2.19 to 4.74). Despite these sedentary and isolated tendencies, the participant reports engaging in solitary exercise three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), suggesting an individual effort towards physical activity. Substance use across all categories is consistently low, below population averages. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently lower GPAs (e.g., 2.25-2.59), suggests potential academic challenges that may intertwine with their psychological and behavioral patterns.

Analysis of wearable data reveals complex sleep and physiological circadian patterns. Despite self-reporting severe sleep disturbance (PSQI score of 13.0), objective Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes (Z-score 0.84), which is above the population average. This discrepancy suggests issues with sleep quality or restorative processes rather than simply insufficient sleep quantity. The participant exhibits an elevated resting heart rate (68.55 BPM, Z-score 1.24) and an overall higher mean heart rate (Mesor 79.76, Z-score 0.79), pointing towards a generally higher state of physiological arousal. The amplitude of their heart rate circadian rhythm is slightly reduced (Z-score -0.38), indicating a less pronounced daily fluctuation in cardiovascular activity. While the overall interdaily stability and intraday variability of heart rate rhythms are near average, suggesting some consistency, hourly heart rate data reveal a blunted nocturnal dip. During the early morning hours (2-6 AM), when heart rate is typically lowest, the participant's heart rate deceleration below their mesor is less pronounced compared to the study population, implying reduced physiological recovery or persistent arousal during sleep. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs in the late afternoon at 5:06 PM.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Based on the multimodal analysis, there is substantial evidence to suggest the participant's CES-D score would likely place them in the top 50% of the study population distribution. The participant exhibits several prominent indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. These include significantly high trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.75, r=0.81 with CES-D), profoundly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -2.28, r=-0.7), and low self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61, r=-0.45). Furthermore, their self-reported sleep quality is severely disturbed (PSQI Z-score 2.9), a cardinal symptom often co-occurring with depression. Behavioral patterns such as extreme social withdrawal (socializing with friends Z-score -2.2) and a preference for solitary, sedentary activities are also consistent with depressive patterns. Physiologically, elevated resting heart rate and overall mean heart rate (Z-scores 1.24 and 0.79 respectively), along with a blunted nocturnal heart rate dip, indicate a heightened and potentially dysregulated physiological arousal state, commonly observed in individuals experiencing mood disorders. While some metrics, like average perceived stress or above-average objective sleep duration, might appear to contradict a high CES-D score, these are outweighed by the multitude of strong, convergent indicators reflecting psychological distress, social isolation, and physiological dysregulation that are highly correlated with depressive symptoms.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
79731,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of significant concern that align with elevated depressive symptomatology. The STAI-Trait score of 60, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.85, places the participant in the ""anxious"" classification, notably high within the study population, and this measure exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem, as measured by the RSES, is considerably low (score 29, Z-score -1.29), showing a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D. Subjective sleep quality is severely impaired, with a PSQI score of 11 (Z-score 1.98), classifying the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is markedly low (score 2.22, Z-score -1.53), negatively correlating with CES-D (-0.39). Perceived stress is slightly elevated (score 23, Z-score 0.38), aligning with a positive correlation (0.28). This constellation of high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, and low health satisfaction suggests a significant psychological burden. Academic performance also shows a decline, with GPA falling from 3.43 in Fall 2015 to 2.62 in Spring 2016, which may reflect the impact of these psychological factors on daily functioning.

Behaviorally, the participant exhibits a notably sedentary lifestyle. Exercise engagement is consistently reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories (alone, with others, and sports), with corresponding low Z-scores (ranging from -1.09 to -1.93). While correlations with CES-D are weak for exercise, this pronounced inactivity is a common feature associated with depressive states. Recreational habits lean heavily towards passive digital consumption, with high engagement in internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score 0.85) and listening to music (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.6), both showing positive correlations with CES-D (0.25). Other sedentary activities like watching TV/videos also show elevated time commitment. Substance usage remains at moderate levels (""1-2 times a month"" for beer/wine/liquor), and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent, suggesting this is not a primary problematic coping mechanism. Interpersonal trust is below average (Z-score -0.78), showing a negative correlation (-0.41) with CES-D, indicating a potential tendency towards social withdrawal or difficulty in interpersonal relations.

Multimodal sleep data reveals a complex pattern of prolonged, yet disturbed, sleep. Self-reported poor sleep quality from the PSQI is juxtaposed with a long median sleep duration of 8 hours 17 minutes, which is above the population average (Z-score 1.37). However, this extended sleep duration is characterized by extremely high variability (Standard Deviation of 177 minutes, Z-score 1.73), suggesting inconsistent sleep-wake patterns. The participant's median sleep start time is very late (02:58 AM), although the variability in this start time is paradoxically lower than average (Standard Deviation 53 minutes, Z-score -0.66). This could indicate a consistent, but severely delayed, sleep schedule rather than chaotic timing. Additionally, there is a high frequency of napping (mean daily naps 0.19, Z-score 1.34), which, along with high sleep duration variability, correlates positively with CES-D, further suggesting non-restorative sleep despite lengthy time in bed.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics further supports a pattern of dysregulation. The participant exhibits an elevated resting heart rate (71.2 bpm, Z-score 1.55) and an increased mesor (mean heart rate) of 79.9 (Z-score 0.81), both positively correlating with CES-D (0.19). This indicates a generally higher state of cardiovascular arousal. The circadian rhythm, as measured by heart rate, appears blunted, with a lower than average amplitude (7.09, Z-score -1.19), suggesting less pronounced daily variations in heart rate. Concurrently, intradaily variability is above average (0.64, Z-score 0.67), while interdaily stability is below average (0.34, Z-score -0.57). These metrics collectively point to a less robust, more fragmented, and less regular cardiovascular circadian rhythm. While hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a typical pattern of nocturnal dips and diurnal rises, the overall context of elevated baseline heart rate and reduced amplitude suggests a physiological system operating under sustained mild activation with less distinct daily patterning.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Multiple self-reported measures indicate a significant burden of symptoms and maladaptive behaviors strongly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant's STAI-Trait score is extremely high (Z-score 1.85, ""anxious"" classification) and shows a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D. This is further supported by a markedly low self-esteem score (Z-score -1.29) which negatively correlates with CES-D (-0.71), and very low health satisfaction (Z-score -1.53). Subjective sleep quality is severely compromised, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 11 (Z-score 1.98). Behavioral patterns include an absence of exercise (Z-scores ranging from -1.09 to -1.93) and a high engagement in passive digital recreation, both known correlates of depression. Wearable data also points to physiological dysregulation, with an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.55) and mesor (Z-score 0.81), and a blunted circadian amplitude (Z-score -1.19), all positively correlated with CES-D. Furthermore, while sleep duration is long, its high variability (Z-score 1.73) and frequent napping (Z-score 1.34) align with higher CES-D scores. The observed decline in academic performance (GPA) from 3.43 to 2.62 further suggests a functional impairment potentially linked to psychological distress.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
Few indicators suggest a lower depressive symptom burden. The participant's current self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) is slightly above the population average. However, this is a momentary measure that may not reflect chronic emotional states, and its negative correlation with CES-D suggests that higher happiness generally aligns with lower CES-D. The participant also reports relatively low substance usage, which typically does not align with higher depressive symptoms based on the weak correlations observed. While the median sleep duration is long (8 hours 17 minutes, Z-score 1.37), which might be considered a positive health indicator, its extremely high variability and the participant's self-reported disturbed sleep quality largely negate its potential protective effect. Lastly, despite a very late sleep start time, its variability is lower than average (Z-score -0.66), implying some consistency in the timing of sleep onset, even if at an atypical hour. The positive correlation between sleep start time variability and CES-D suggests that lower variability would align with a lower CES-D, though the overall context of sleep dysregulation is paramount.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Considering the totality of the evidence, the indicators overwhelmingly point towards a significantly elevated depressive symptom burden. The high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, low health satisfaction, and complete lack of exercise represent a confluence of robust risk factors and direct manifestations of depressive states, all strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores. The physiological markers of elevated resting heart rate and blunted, less stable circadian rhythms provide objective support for systemic dysregulation. While some isolated data points might superficially suggest a lower burden (e.g., above-average current happiness, long sleep duration, consistent sleep start time), these are either contradicted by other, more pervasive and trait-like measures (e.g., self-reported disturbed sleep despite long duration), or are of insufficient magnitude to outweigh the multitude of strong, convergent indicators for elevated depressive symptoms. Therefore, it is highly probable that this participant's CES-D score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by notable strengths in mental well-being and resilience, largely supported by robust physiological and behavioral patterns. Self-report data indicate significantly lower-than-average trait anxiety (Z-score -0.62), notably higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.96), and a substantially elevated level of current happiness (Z-score 1.64). Perceived stress levels are also remarkably low (Z-score -0.98), suggesting effective coping or fewer stressors. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is classified as ""Good Sleep"" with a below-average score (Z-score -0.8), further supporting a positive mental state. The participant also reports an above-average degree of interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5). The only self-reported area of relative weakness is health satisfaction, which is slightly below average (Z-score -0.78).

Behaviorally, the participant maintains very low or no engagement in substance use, including alcohol and recreational or non-prescribed drugs. While exercise engaged in alone or through sports is minimal, the participant reports exercising with others 1-2 times a week, suggesting some level of physical activity and potential social engagement. Recreational habits show low engagement in various screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage, as well as less time socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41) and no reported reading. However, time spent on a sedentary hobby is above average (Z-score 0.82). The generally low engagement in several popular recreational and social activities is a minor point of interest, but without stronger correlations or supporting data, it does not overtly suggest distress in this context, especially given the positive psychological indicators.

Objective wearable data reveal a highly regular and robust physiological rhythm. The participant demonstrates significantly high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.41) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.32), indicating a consistent daily pattern in heart rate. Concurrently, the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is exceptionally high (Z-score 2.7), reflecting a pronounced and well-differentiated physiological response between active and rest periods. This robust rhythm is further evidenced by hourly heart rate deviations, which show substantial drops during the typical sleep hours (e.g., -34.27 bpm below mesor from 4-5 AM) and significant elevations during active daytime periods (e.g., +23.24 bpm above mesor from 4-5 PM), both values notably extreme relative to the study population. Their resting heart rate is also significantly lower than average (Z-score -0.99), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. These robust circadian and cardiovascular metrics generally align with a profile of good physical health and potentially contribute to mental well-being.

Sleep patterns, derived from wearable data, reinforce the overall picture of regularity and consistency. While the median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours 52 minutes (Z-score -0.4), the participant exhibits significantly low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -1.33) and sleep start times (Z-score -0.72). This consistency indicates a highly regular sleep schedule and strong sleep hygiene. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86) further suggests adequate and consolidated nighttime sleep, consistent with the self-reported good sleep quality.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**

The participant presents compelling evidence for a CES-D score in the bottom half of the study population. Self-reported measures show significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.62, correlation 0.81 with CES-D), higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.96, correlation -0.71), markedly higher current happiness (Z-score 1.64, correlation -0.46), and substantially lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.98, correlation 0.28). These psychological traits are strongly and consistently associated with lower depressive symptomatology in the study population. Furthermore, the participant's self-reported good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score -0.8) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5, correlation -0.41) align with a profile of lower depressive symptoms.

Objective wearable data provide further strong support. The participant exhibits exceptionally stable (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.41) and robust (Amplitude Z-score 2.7) heart rate-based circadian rhythms, which are generally indicative of better physiological and mental health. Their sleep patterns are highly consistent, with significantly lower variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -1.33, correlation 0.19) and sleep start times (Z-score -0.72, correlation 0.21), both correlating with lower CES-D scores. The absence of daily naps (Z-score -0.86, correlation 0.21) also points towards lower depressive symptom burden. Additionally, a lower resting heart rate (Z-score -0.99, correlation 0.19) is weakly associated with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**

There are a few minor indicators that could be associated with a higher CES-D score, but they are considerably weaker in magnitude and fewer in number compared to the counter-evidence. The participant reports slightly below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78, correlation -0.4), where lower satisfaction is linked to higher CES-D. The mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score 0.34, correlation 0.19) is slightly above average, which is weakly correlated with higher CES-D. Lastly, lower internet usage (Z-score -1.83) has a weak positive correlation (0.25) with CES-D, suggesting less internet use is weakly linked to higher CES-D. Other behavioral aspects like lower time socializing with friends or not reading do not have strong correlations with CES-D in this dataset, and therefore do not provide substantial evidence for elevated depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**

The cumulative evidence overwhelmingly points towards a profile inconsistent with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant demonstrates a strong constellation of positive psychological traits—low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, and low perceived stress—which are strongly predictive of lower CES-D scores. These are robustly corroborated by objective physiological and behavioral data, including exceptionally stable and prominent circadian rhythms, highly consistent sleep patterns, and good cardiovascular fitness. While a few minor data points suggest a very slight potential for higher CES-D, their influence is minimal in contrast to the numerous and strong indicators for lower depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the holistic assessment of all available data, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely to be relatively low or average within the study population.

17569,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents a nuanced picture of well-being, characterized by both notable strengths and areas of concern. On one hand, the participant reports a non-anxious trait score (STAI Z-score -0.33) and above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.68), both of which are strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in the study population. Additionally, higher-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.15) and significant satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.13) further suggest a resilient psychological foundation, as these factors also correlate negatively with CES-D scores. However, these strengths are juxtaposed with indicators of distress: the participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53) and above-average perceived stress (Z-score 0.65). Subjectively, sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59), which commonly indicates clinically significant sleep issues. Academically, a declining trend in GPA across academic semesters (Fall 2015: 3.37, Spring 2016: 3.27, Fall 2016: 2.8) may reflect increasing academic strain or other underlying challenges.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a selective engagement in physical activities and moderate social interaction. While engagement in solitary exercise is notably low (Z-score -1.93), the participant actively engages in exercise with others (Z-score 0.53) at an above-average frequency. Participation in organized sports is absent (Z-score -1.09). Recreational habits are generally low across various passive activities such as watching TV, playing video games, internet usage, and listening to music, with a self-reported absence of sedentary hobbies. Socializing with friends occurs at an average frequency (1-2 hours daily, Z-score 0.16). Alcohol consumption includes above-average beer usage (1-2 times a week, Z-score 1.01) but minimal use of other substances. These patterns suggest a preference for social engagement in physical activity but limited solitary or passive recreational pursuits.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal a remarkably consistent and robust circadian rhythm, alongside critically low sleep duration. The participant exhibits high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.16) and a pronounced amplitude (Z-score 0.91) in heart rate, indicating a regular and well-differentiated activity/rest cycle, despite a relatively late acrophase at 4:14 PM. This robust rhythm is coupled with a significantly low resting heart rate (47.0 bpm, Z-score -1.33), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. However, objective sleep metrics present a stark contrast: the median sleep duration is extremely low at 5 hours 44 minutes (Z-score -1.81), a duration far below recommended guidelines. Sleep onset is consistently late, with a median start time of 01:11:30 and low variability (Z-score -1.12), indicating a highly structured but severely truncated sleep schedule, without compensatory napping (Z-score -0.86). This objective sleep deprivation aligns with the self-reported disturbed sleep quality (PSQI).

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor further illuminates daily physiological patterns. Significant heart rate reductions, reflecting deep physiological rest, are observed during the early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM, with Z-scores ranging from -1.52 to -2.02). Conversely, distinct periods of elevated heart rate, indicative of higher physiological arousal or activity, are present in the late morning (9-10 AM, Z-score 2.05), early afternoon (1-2 PM, Z-score 1.46), and into the evening (6-7 PM, Z-score 0.99, and 10-11 PM, Z-score 1.16). This pattern reinforces the impression of a highly structured daily routine with clear peaks of activity and troughs of rest, though the critical issue remains the severely shortened duration of the rest period.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant presents several strong psychological indicators that typically correlate with a lower burden of depressive symptoms. The STAI-Trait score is in the ""not anxious"" classification (Z-score -0.33), and notably, anxiety has a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores in this population. This suggests that the participant's lower-than-average anxiety would predict a lower CES-D score. Similarly, the participant reports above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.68), which exhibits a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores, again pointing towards fewer depressive symptoms. Additionally, above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.15, correlation -0.41) and high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 1.13, correlation -0.39) further contribute to this pattern, as these factors are also moderately negatively correlated with CES-D. Engagement in exercise with others (Z-score 0.53) also shows a modest negative correlation (-0.23) with CES-D. Physiologically, the robust and stable circadian rhythm (high Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.16, high Amplitude Z-score 0.91) might be protective, even if their correlations with CES-D are weak in this dataset.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several factors suggest an elevated risk for depressive symptoms. The participant reports below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) with CES-D, implying lower happiness is associated with higher CES-D. Perceived stress is above average (Z-score 0.65), and stress shows a positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D. Critically, both subjective and objective sleep data point to significant disturbance: the PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) indicates clinically significant poor sleep quality. Objectively, Fitbit data reveals an extremely short median sleep duration of 5 hours 44 minutes (Z-score -1.81). While the correlation of objective sleep duration with CES-D is very weak (-0.01) in this dataset, severe sleep deprivation is a well-established risk factor and symptom of depression. The declining GPA over semesters, while not directly correlated with CES-D, could also reflect an impact of increased psychological burden.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile presents a complex picture. On one hand, there are robust self-reported psychological strengths, specifically low anxiety and high self-esteem, which have the strongest correlations with lower CES-D scores in the study population. High trust and health satisfaction further support this. On the other hand, the participant experiences significant and objectively verifiable sleep deprivation, coupled with subjective reports of low happiness and high stress, which are known indicators of depressive symptomatology. However, the correlations provided for objective sleep metrics (duration and variability) with CES-D are notably weak in this dataset. Given the explicit guidance to prioritize strong correlations while maintaining a holistic view, the pronounced protective factors (low anxiety, high self-esteem) with their strong negative correlations appear to exert a significant influence on the overall symptom burden. Despite severe sleep issues and some subjective distress, the core positive self-regard and low anxiety suggest that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is more likely to fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

77036,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"The participant's data presents a complex profile with various psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators. Self-report measures indicate a slightly above-average level of anxiety (STAI score 43, Z-score 0.17), classified as ""anxious,"" which correlates strongly and positively with the CES-D score (0.81). This suggests that elevated anxiety is a significant component of their overall distress. Concurrently, the participant reports above-average happiness (Score 4, Z-score 0.55) and above-average perceived stress (PSS score 23, Z-score 0.38), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46) for happiness and a weaker positive correlation (0.28) for stress. Self-esteem (Score 38, Z-score -0.03) is average for the population but strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), implying that while their self-esteem is typical, lower self-esteem is a strong indicator of higher depressive symptoms in the population. Furthermore, the participant reports below-average interpersonal trust (Score 3, Z-score -0.46) and below-average satisfaction with physical health (Score 3.56, Z-score -0.53), with both factors moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41 and -0.39, respectively). This indicates that lower trust and lower health satisfaction are associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Behaviorally, the participant generally exhibits very low engagement in a wide range of recreational activities. They report ""Do not do"" or spend ""16-30 minutes"" on activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25), video games (Z-score -0.56), internet usage (Z-score -1.16), listening to music (Z-score -1.19), socializing with friends (Z-score -1.41), reading (Z-score -0.67), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96). Notably, for several of these activities (Internet Usage, Listening to Music, Watching TV/Videos/Movies, Sedentary Hobby, Reading, Video Games), a lower engagement (negative Z-scores) is positively correlated with CES-D scores (ranging from 0.06 to 0.25). This consistent pattern of reduced participation in potentially rewarding activities, coupled with its positive association with CES-D, serves as a significant behavioral marker related to depressive symptoms. Substance usage is generally low, with negative Z-scores across categories, and weak correlations to CES-D. Exercise habits show below-average frequency for exercising alone or with others, but above-average frequency for sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score 0.91), though exercise activities show weak correlations with CES-D.

Regarding sleep, the participant's self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is 6, classifying it as ""Disturbed Sleep"" due to exceeding the clinical threshold of 5. However, their PSQI Z-score (-0.33) indicates that their self-reported sleep disturbance is actually less severe than the average for the study population, suggesting that the population overall experiences significant sleep issues. Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 51 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.41). Interestingly, the participant demonstrates very high consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation 67 minutes, Z-score -0.77) and sleep start time (standard deviation 58 minutes, Z-score -0.55). Despite this high regularity, these low variability metrics weakly correlate positively with CES-D (0.20 and 0.22, respectively), suggesting that for this participant, a rigid sleep schedule might not be protective against depressive symptoms. The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86), which weakly correlates positively with CES-D (0.21).

Wearable-derived physiological data indicate a highly stable and regular circadian rhythm. The Interdaily Stability (0.53, Z-score 1.0) is high, the Intradaily Variability (0.36, Z-score -1.31) is low, and the Autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.62, Z-score 2.49) is very high, all pointing to a highly structured daily pattern of physiological activity. The mean heart rate (Mesor 78.49, Z-score 0.62) and resting heart rate (61.2, Z-score 0.36) are both slightly elevated compared to the population, and both show a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.19). The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear diurnal pattern, with significant drops during typical sleep hours and increases during waking hours, peaking in the afternoon, indicative of a generally healthy physiological rhythm despite the overall elevated baseline. However, the correlations between hourly heart rate patterns and CES-D are generally weak.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is primarily driven by:
*   **Elevated Anxiety:** The STAI score is classified as ""anxious"" and has an exceptionally strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). This is a highly significant indicator that greater anxiety is directly linked to higher depressive symptoms for this individual.
*   **Pervasive Lack of Recreational Engagement:** The participant's notably low participation across numerous daily recreational activities (e.g., internet usage, listening to music, reading) consistently correlates positively with CES-D. This behavioral pattern is a strong indicator of reduced pleasure or interest, often associated with anhedonia in depressive states.
*   **Disturbed Sleep:** Despite a PSQI Z-score indicating less disturbance than the average population, the raw PSQI score of 6 crosses the clinical threshold for disturbed sleep, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Elevated Perceived Stress:** The participant reports above-average stress, which is positively correlated with CES-D.
*   **Lower Interpersonal Trust and Health Satisfaction:** Both scores are below average and negatively correlated with CES-D, meaning lower trust and health satisfaction are associated with higher depressive symptoms.
*   **Physiological Indicators:** Slightly elevated resting and mean heart rates (Mesor) with weak positive correlations to CES-D suggest a subtle underlying physiological arousal that may accompany depressive symptoms.
*   **Sleep Consistency Paradox:** While having very consistent sleep duration and timing, these metrics paradoxically show weak positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting that for this participant, high sleep rigidity is not protective against, and may even be associated with, higher depressive symptoms.

Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) includes:
*   **Above-Average Happiness:** The participant reports higher happiness, which has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting that higher happiness is linked to lower depressive symptoms.
*   **Average Self-Esteem:** While self-esteem has a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), the participant's score is average, which would typically predict an average or slightly below-average CES-D score, rather than a high one.
*   **Relatively Less Disturbed Sleep (by Z-score):** Compared to the study population, the participant's self-reported sleep disturbance is lower, although the absolute score indicates clinical disturbance.
*   **Highly Stable Circadian Rhythm:** Wearable data show a very regular and stable heart rate-based circadian rhythm, which typically indicates good physiological health, though its correlations with CES-D are negligible.

Holistic analysis reveals a profile where strong indicators of distress (anxiety, stress), behavioral withdrawal (low recreational engagement), and problematic sleep outweigh the participant's average self-esteem and above-average happiness. The exceptionally strong positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D, coupled with the pervasive lack of engagement in activities that for this population are associated with higher CES-D when not engaged in, strongly suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite some counter-indicators, the overall pattern points towards a higher depressive symptom load.

82986,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"The participant exhibits a complex profile, marked by notable strengths in psychological well-being juxtaposed with significant physiological and behavioral challenges. Self-report measures consistently indicate a favorable psychological state, with trait anxiety, as assessed by the STAI, being remarkably low (score 25.0, Z-score -1.61), placing the participant well below the population mean and classified as ""not anxious."" This low anxiety is strongly associated with lower CES-D scores, as indicated by a correlation of 0.81. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES score 50.0, Z-score 1.66), a high degree of interpersonal trust (score 4.17, Z-score 1.79), and above-average current happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64). These positive psychological attributes are all robustly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study population (-0.71, -0.41, and -0.46 respectively), suggesting they act as significant protective factors against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress levels are also comparatively low (PSS score 19.0, Z-score -0.71), a finding that aligns with a tendency towards lower CES-D scores (r=0.28). Furthermore, the participant expresses higher-than-average satisfaction with their physical health (score 5.33, Z-score 0.8), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39).

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports abstaining from all surveyed substance usage, including beer, wine/liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low Z-scores (ranging from -0.31 to -1.3) relative to the population. Exercise habits are moderate, primarily involving exercising alone 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32), with less frequent engagement in group exercise or sports. Daily recreational activities show minimal engagement in passive forms of entertainment such as watching TV/videos, video games, listening to music, or reading. Internet usage is approximately 31 minutes per hour (Z-score -0.49), and socializing with friends is reported at 1-2 hours per day (Z-score 0.16). A concerning and salient behavioral pattern is observed in academic performance, where the participant's GPA has shown a consistent decline over three academic semesters, from 3.4 in Fall 2015 to 2.41 in Fall 2016, indicating a significant and worsening challenge in academic functioning.

Sleep patterns represent a major area of concern, largely contrasting with the otherwise favorable self-reported psychological state. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant's subjective sleep quality as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" although the Z-score (-0.33) suggests this is not an extreme deviation from the population mean for sleep disturbance. Objective Fitbit data, however, reveals severely restricted median sleep duration of only 5 hours 6 minutes, an extremely low value falling more than 2.5 standard deviations below the population mean (Z-score -2.6). This extreme sleep deprivation is coupled with a very late median sleep start time of 02:24 AM. Despite the severity of these objective sleep metrics, the participant's sleep duration standard deviation (68 minutes, Z-score -0.75) and sleep start time standard deviation (61 minutes, Z-score -0.48) suggest a relatively consistent, albeit problematic, sleep schedule. It is noteworthy that the correlations between these specific objective sleep metrics and CES-D are weak to negligible, suggesting that in this particular study population, objective sleep duration or consistency may not be primary determinants of reported depressive symptoms, or that their impact is buffered by other factors.

Further physiological insights are provided by heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics. The participant exhibits moderately lower interdaily stability (value 0.33, Z-score -0.66) and a reduced amplitude (value 7.55, Z-score -1.04) in their cardiovascular rhythm compared to the study population, suggesting a somewhat less regular and blunted physiological rhythm. The acrophase, which represents the time of peak cardiovascular activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:37 PM. The participant's average heart rate (Mesor 79.73 bpm, Z-score 0.79) and resting heart rate (66.8 bpm, Z-score 1.03) are both above the population mean, indicating a generally elevated physiological state. These circadian and cardiac metrics show modest correlations with CES-D. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a typical nocturnal trough, followed by a robust and above-average increase in heart rate during the morning (e.g., 7-8 AM, Z-score 1.51; 8-9 AM, Z-score 1.32). A distinctive dip below the mesor is observed in the late afternoon (5-6 PM, Z-score -1.59), which is uncharacteristic and could signify a period of reduced activity or physiological slump, before heart rate subsequently re-elevates and remains above the mesor into the late evening (10-12 AM, Z-scores 0.71-0.79). This sustained elevated heart rate into the late hours aligns with the objectively measured very late sleep start time.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence pointing towards a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial and primarily derived from the participant's self-reported psychological characteristics. The participant's significantly low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.61) shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), meaning lower anxiety in the population is strongly linked to lower depressive symptoms. This is further supported by high self-esteem (Z-score 1.66), high current happiness (Z-score 1.64), high interpersonal trust (Z-score 1.79), and above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.8), all of which exhibit strong negative correlations with CES-D (-0.71, -0.46, -0.41, and -0.39, respectively). These multiple, highly correlated psychological protective factors consistently and robustly indicate a lower burden of depressive symptomatology compared to the study population average. Low perceived stress and abstinence from substance use further contribute to this protective psychological profile.

Conversely, evidence that might suggest a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) largely stems from objective behavioral and physiological data. The participant's severely disturbed objective sleep, characterized by a median sleep duration of merely 5 hours 6 minutes (Z-score -2.6) and a very late median sleep start time of 02:24 AM, represents a significant functional impairment. While the correlation between objective sleep duration and CES-D is negligible in this specific dataset (-0.02), such extreme sleep deprivation often accompanies significant distress or functional issues. The marked decline in academic performance (GPA dropping from 3.4 to 2.41) is another salient behavioral indicator of potential difficulties. Additionally, wearable data reveals moderately less stable and blunted circadian rhythms (lower Interdaily Stability Z-score -0.66; lower Amplitude Z-score -1.04) and an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score 1.03), features that typically show positive correlations (albeit generally weaker than the self-report psychological traits) with higher CES-D scores in the study population.

Synthesizing the multimodal data, the strong and consistent evidence from self-reported psychological measures, which are highly correlated with CES-D scores in this study population, predominantly indicates a lower depressive symptom burden. While the objective sleep deprivation and academic decline are significant concerns that would typically raise flags for potential depressive symptoms, the participant's consistently strong psychological protective factors (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, etc.) are, in the context of the provided population correlations, more indicative of a healthier overall psychological state directly related to depressive symptomatology. Therefore, based on the preponderance of the available evidence, particularly the robust correlations from the self-report data, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
11402,17.0,0.727979274611399,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's psychological profile is notably characterized by significantly elevated trait anxiety, as indicated by a STAI score of 54.0 (Z-score = 1.25), which classifies them as anxious relative to the study population. This finding is particularly salient due to its strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.81). Despite this, the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES score of 40.0, Z-score = 0.26), a measure negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Current self-reported happiness (3.0, Z-score = -0.53) and health satisfaction (3.56, Z-score = -0.53) are both below the population average, aligning with negative correlations with CES-D. Perceived stress levels (PSS score of 21.0, Z-score = -0.17) are close to the population mean, showing a modest positive correlation with CES-D (0.28). Additionally, the participant reports above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 1.15), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41). This combination suggests an individual experiencing heightened anxiety and reduced overall well-being and health satisfaction, despite possessing psychological strengths such as self-esteem and trust, which may act as mitigating factors.

Sleep patterns present a significant area of concern, exhibiting notable discrepancies between self-report and objective measures. While the self-reported PSQI score (5.0, Z-score = -0.8) suggests ""Good Sleep,"" objective wearable data reveals considerable disruption. The participant's median sleep duration is significantly short at 6 hours and 19 minutes (Z-score = -1.07). Furthermore, there is substantial variability in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 136 minutes, Z-score = 0.8) and sleep start times (median 03:17:50, standard deviation of 135 minutes, Z-score = 1.14), indicating a highly inconsistent sleep schedule. Both sleep duration and start time variability are positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.2 and 0.22, respectively). The participant also engages in a higher-than-average frequency of napping (Z-score = 1.21), which also correlates positively with CES-D (0.21) and may serve as a compensatory mechanism for insufficient nocturnal sleep. Physiologically, circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data indicates a lower intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.45), potentially reflecting a blunted physiological response or reduced dynamic activity throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, occurs relatively late at 6:58 PM. Both mean heart rate (Mesor: 83.48 bpm, Z-score = 1.3) and resting heart rate (63.4 bpm, Z-score = 0.62) are elevated compared to the population, both correlating positively with CES-D (0.19), suggesting a state of higher physiological arousal. Hourly heart rate deviations further illustrate this pattern, with higher-than-average HR during late-night hours (e.g., 12-2 AM) and significantly lower-than-average HR during late morning hours (e.g., 9-10 AM, Z-score = -1.69), suggesting a delayed onset of daily physiological activity and prolonged activity late into the night.

Behaviorally, the participant's lifestyle is characterized by a notable engagement in sedentary activities and screen time. There is a particularly high consumption of video games (1-2 hours daily, Z-score = 2.47) and watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours daily, Z-score = 1.28), alongside above-average internet usage (2-3 hours daily, Z-score = 0.85). Conversely, engagement in reading is reported as absent (Z-score = -0.67). Exercise habits include 1-2 times a week of exercising alone (Z-score = 0.32) and with others (Z-score = 0.53), suggesting a moderate level of structured physical activity, though participation in sports is not reported (Z-score = -1.09). Substance use includes above-average beer consumption (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 1.01), with no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. The participant's Body Mass Index (30.13) is in the obese range, which, in conjunction with the activity data, could indicate a less active overall lifestyle.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile, <= 11.0):**

*   **High Self-Esteem:** The participant reports a high self-esteem score (40.0, Z-score = 0.26), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71). High self-esteem is generally considered a protective factor against depressive symptoms.
*   **Average Perceived Stress:** The Perceived Stress Scale score (21.0, Z-score = -0.17) is close to the population mean, suggesting that general stress levels are not remarkably high, despite a positive correlation with CES-D (0.28).
*   **High Interpersonal Trust:** The participant's high trust score (3.83, Z-score = 1.15) has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41), indicating a social resource that could buffer against depressive symptoms.
*   **Self-Reported ""Good Sleep"":** While contradicted by wearable data, the participant's subjective assessment of sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score = -0.8) indicates ""Good Sleep."" This subjective perception, if truly believed by the individual, might alleviate some distress associated with sleep problems.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile, > 11.0):**

*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety:** A STAI score of 54.0 (Z-score = 1.25) places the participant in the ""anxious"" classification, and this metric has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). This is one of the most significant indicators suggesting a higher CES-D score.
*   **Below Average Happiness and Health Satisfaction:** The participant's current happiness (Z-score = -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score = -0.53) are both below population averages and are negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively). Reduced happiness and satisfaction are direct indicators often associated with depressive symptomatology.
*   **Significant Objective Sleep Disruption:** Wearable data reveal consistently short sleep duration (Z-score = -1.07), high variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 0.8), extremely late sleep start times (03:17:50), and high variability in sleep start times (Z-score = 1.14). All of these objective sleep metrics, along with higher napping frequency (Z-score = 1.21), are positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.2, 0.22, 0.21). Such pervasive sleep disturbance is a well-established risk factor and symptom domain of depression.
*   **Elevated Physiological Arousal and Disrupted Circadian Rhythm:** The participant exhibits an elevated Mesor (Z-score = 1.3) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score = 0.62), both positively correlated with CES-D (0.19). This higher baseline cardiovascular activity suggests a state of chronic physiological arousal that is often linked to anxiety and depression. The low intradaily variability (Z-score = -1.45) and late acrophase (6:58 PM), along with delayed morning heart rate recovery, indicate an irregular and blunted circadian rhythm, which is also associated with mood disorders.
*   **Sedentary Lifestyle:** The very high engagement in screen-based activities like video games (Z-score = 2.47) and watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = 1.28), coupled with a lack of reading and an obese BMI, suggests a lifestyle that may lack engaging, mood-boosting activities and could contribute to feelings of lethargy or social withdrawal, which are common in depression.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The collective evidence strongly indicates that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as reflected by the CES-D, is likely in the top 50% of the study population. The high trait anxiety, evidenced by the STAI score and its very strong correlation with CES-D, is a primary indicator. This is significantly compounded by the objective and widespread sleep disturbances (short duration, high variability, late start times, frequent napping), which are all correlated with higher CES-D scores and are central to depressive phenomenology. Furthermore, physiological markers such as elevated resting and mean heart rates, and a disrupted circadian rhythm, point towards increased physiological arousal and dysregulation, also positively correlated with CES-D. While factors like high self-esteem and average perceived stress could offer some resilience, they appear insufficient to offset the profound anxiety, objective sleep pathology, and physiological dysregulation, alongside reduced happiness and health satisfaction. The disparity between the participant's subjective ""good sleep"" and objectively poor sleep is particularly notable, suggesting a potential lack of awareness or acceptance of their sleep difficulties, which can contribute to chronic mood issues.

The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by generally positive self-reported psychological well-being and adaptive behavioral habits, contrasted with significant physiological indicators of chronic strain and severe sleep deprivation.

Psychologically, the participant demonstrates robust mental health, scoring exceptionally low on trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.31) and remarkably high on self-esteem (RSES Z-score = 1.66), happiness (Z-score = 1.64), and health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.13). These scores are notably above the study population average, suggesting a resilient and positive self-perception, strong self-worth, and general contentment. Additionally, their self-reported interpersonal trust is higher than average (Z-score = 0.83), contributing to a profile of overall psychological strength. Academic performance, as indicated by a consistently high GPA (ranging from 3.6 to 3.86), further supports a well-functioning individual. However, the participant reports slightly elevated levels of perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.38) and classifies their sleep quality as disturbed according to the PSQI (score of 7, Z-score = 0.13), indicating a potential area of concern despite the generally positive psychological disposition.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a healthy lifestyle with very low or no reported substance use. They engage actively in physical exercise, particularly with others (Z-score = 1.23, indicating frequent engagement), which can be a significant protective factor for mental well-being and social connection. However, self-reported time spent socializing with friends is notably low (Z-score = -1.41), suggesting that their social interactions might primarily occur within the context of structured physical activities rather than broader social engagements. Recreational activities like watching TV/videos/movies, playing video games, and reading are also reported at lower frequencies or not at all.

Wearable-derived physiological data reveal a striking pattern of severe sleep deprivation and elevated physiological arousal. The participant's median sleep duration is critically short at 5 hours 46 minutes (Z-score = -1.76), placing them significantly below the population average. This very limited sleep is accompanied by a notably late median sleep start time of 02:39:15, indicating an atypical sleep schedule, although the variability in sleep duration and start time is slightly below average (Z-scores of -0.25 and -0.63, respectively), suggesting a consistent but severely restricted sleep pattern. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate minor deviations from population norms, with slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score = -0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = -0.36), and slightly higher intradaily variability (Z-score = 0.32), which collectively suggest subtle irregularities in their daily activity-rest patterns. More prominently, the participant exhibits an elevated resting heart rate (67.7 bpm, Z-score = 1.14) and a high mean heart rate (Mesor = 82.33, Z-score = 1.14), both suggesting a state of increased general cardiovascular activity and physiological arousal. The amplitude of their heart rate-based circadian rhythm is notably low (7.23, Z-score = -1.15), indicating a dampened physiological variation between active and resting periods, which can be indicative of chronic stress or reduced physiological adaptability. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show a significant and sustained drop during the early morning hours (approximately 2 AM to 7 AM), consistent with a period of rest, followed by peaks in activity during the late morning (9-10 AM) and evening (9-11 PM). The acrophase at 5:32 PM indicates the typical timing of peak heart rate activity according to the cosinor model.

In summary, the participant presents a complex profile where strong self-reported psychological well-being, high self-esteem, happiness, and low anxiety are juxtaposed with objectively severe sleep deprivation and physiological markers of chronic arousal (high resting heart rate, high mesor, low circadian amplitude). While the self-report data suggest a robust psychological state, the physiological metrics indicate significant underlying strain and dysregulation, particularly concerning sleep and cardiovascular health, which are often implicated in the experience and development of depressive symptoms, even if not consciously perceived or reported through specific trait measures.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**

The participant demonstrates strong self-reported psychological indicators that are robustly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study population. Specifically, their very low STAI-Trait score (Z-score = -1.31) has a high positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), meaning lower anxiety is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, the participant's exceptionally high Self-Esteem score (Z-score = 1.66) has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), indicating that higher self-esteem is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. High self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64) is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), further supporting a lower depressive symptom burden. Additional protective factors include high health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.13, correlation = -0.39) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83, correlation = -0.41), both moderately negatively correlated with CES-D. Engagement in exercise with others (Z-score = 1.23, correlation = -0.23) also presents a weak protective factor. These combined self-report measures, particularly those with strong correlations (STAI, Self-Esteem, Happiness), strongly suggest a lower burden of depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**

Several physiological and behavioral metrics, while objectively concerning, exhibit weaker or negligible correlations with CES-D in this specific study population. The participant's extremely short median sleep duration (5 hours 46 minutes, Z-score = -1.76) is a severe physiological stressor. However, its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is negligible (-0.01). While the PSQI score indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 7, Z-score = 0.13), its direct correlation with CES-D is not provided, and its Z-score is only slightly above average. Elevated perceived stress (PSS Z-score = 0.38) is positively correlated with CES-D (0.28), but this correlation is weak. Similarly, the elevated resting heart rate (Z-score = 1.14) and high heart rate Mesor (Z-score = 1.14), while indicative of physiological arousal, only have a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.2). The notably low circadian amplitude (Z-score = -1.15) also has a very weak negative correlation with CES-D (-0.11), meaning lower amplitude is very weakly associated with higher CES-D. Although these physiological markers represent significant deviations from population norms and suggest a state of chronic strain or vulnerability, their explanatory power for CES-D scores, based on the provided correlations *within this specific study*, is considerably weaker than the self-reported psychological factors.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The holistic analysis reveals a significant divergence between self-reported psychological well-being and objective physiological stress markers. While the participant's body appears to be under considerable strain due to severe sleep deprivation and elevated physiological arousal, the provided correlations indicate that these physiological metrics are weakly or negligibly associated with CES-D scores in the study population. In contrast, the participant's highly positive self-reports on anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness show strong, robust correlations with lower CES-D scores. Given the explicit instruction to use the provided correlations to aid interpretation, the weight of evidence from the highly correlated psychological self-report measures strongly outweighs the weakly or negligibly correlated physiological indicators in predicting the CES-D score *within this study's context*. Therefore, despite the presence of significant physiological vulnerabilities, the overall pattern of evidence points towards a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents a largely positive picture across key indicators of mental well-being. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (score: 25.0, Z-score: -1.61), categorizing the participant as ""not anxious,"" a factor strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms (correlation with CES-D: 0.81). Self-esteem is considerably above the population mean (score: 50.0, Z-score: 1.66), and this elevated self-esteem demonstrates a robust negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71). Similarly, self-reported happiness (score: 5.0, Z-score: 1.64) is significantly higher than average and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). Perceived stress falls near the population average (score: 21.0, Z-score: -0.17). Furthermore, the participant reports high satisfaction with their health (score: 7.0, Z-score: 2.05), a metric negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). Interpersonal trust also registers above the population mean (score: 3.67, Z-score: 0.83). Collectively, these self-report measures indicate a psychological disposition characterized by low anxiety, high self-esteem, and overall positive affect, which are typically associated with reduced depressive symptomatology.

Sleep patterns present a nuanced situation, with self-reported challenges contrasting with some objective consistency. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59) indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" placing the participant above the population mean for poorer subjective sleep quality, a variable generally correlated positively with CES-D scores. However, objective Fitbit data show a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 53 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score: -0.37) but within a commonly observed range. Notably, the participant exhibits high regularity in sleep onset, as indicated by a low standard deviation in sleep start time (48 minutes, Z-score: -0.77). Sleep duration variability is approximately average (96 minutes, Z-score: -0.1). The frequency of daily naps (0.11, Z-score: 0.44) is slightly above average and shows a positive correlation with CES-D. While the subjective experience of sleep quality is reported as disturbed, the consistent timing of sleep captured by wearables suggests a relatively structured sleep routine.

The participant's heart rate-derived circadian rhythms demonstrate a well-defined and stable pattern. Interdaily stability (Value: 0.51, Z-score: 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Value: 0.41, Z-score: 0.73) are both above average, reflecting high regularity and predictability in their physiological rhythm from day to day. Intradaily variability is near the population average (Value: 0.51, Z-score: -0.25). The MESOR (mean value of the rhythm) of 80.72 bpm (Z-score: 0.92) and the amplitude (peak-to-trough variation) of 13.98 bpm (Z-score: 1.03) are both higher than the population mean, suggesting a pronounced and active cardiovascular rhythm throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs in the mid-afternoon at 4:20 PM. The resting heart rate is slightly above average at 60.8 bpm (Z-score: 0.32). Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations from the MESOR exhibit a clear diurnal pattern, with values consistently negative during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -24.57 bpm at 5-6 am, Z-score: -0.90) and progressively rising to positive deviations during waking hours, peaking around mid-afternoon (e.g., +16.37 bpm at 3-4 pm, Z-score: 1.35). These robust and regular circadian characteristics, particularly the high stability and amplitude, are often associated with physiological resilience and better overall health outcomes.

Regarding lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant generally adopts healthy practices, particularly concerning substance use and physical activity. There is no reported usage of beer, wine or liquor, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs (all Z-scores are significantly negative). While reported exercise frequency for exercising alone (Z-score: -1.18) and with others (Z-score: -0.17) is below average, the participant engages in ""Sports"" 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.91), which is above the population mean and shows a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.15), indicating a beneficial physical activity habit. Engagement in sedentary screen-based activities like watching TV/videos/movies and playing video games is reported as ""Do not do"" (all Z-scores are significantly negative). Internet usage (16-30 minutes, Z-score: -1.16) and listening to music (15 minutes or less, Z-score: -0.72) are below average. Socializing with friends (31 minutes an hour, Z-score: -0.62) is slightly below average, and reading is reported as ""Do not do"" (Z-score: -0.67). Overall, the participant demonstrates minimal engagement in substance use and sedentary activities, with regular participation in sports contributing positively to their behavioral profile.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To determine the participant's likely CES-D score group, a holistic assessment of all available data, considering Z-scores and correlations, is performed. The study population's CES-D mean is 13.34 and the median is 11.5.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
A strong convergence of evidence suggests the participant's CES-D score would fall within the bottom 50th percentile. The participant's notably low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.61), high self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.66), and high self-reported happiness (Z-score: 1.64) are all potent psychological protective factors, with robust negative correlations to CES-D (-0.81, -0.71, and -0.46 respectively, when considering the nature of the STAI scale and its positive correlation meaning higher anxiety relates to higher CES-D, hence low anxiety -> low CES-D). High health satisfaction (Z-score: 2.05) also contributes negatively to CES-D correlation (-0.39). Behaviorally, the complete absence of substance use (all substance Z-scores significantly negative) and above-average engagement in sports (Z-score: 0.91, correlation: -0.15) indicate healthy coping mechanisms and lifestyle choices. Physiologically, the highly stable circadian rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score: 0.83; Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score: 0.73) and remarkably consistent sleep start times (Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation Z-score: -0.77) reflect a well-regulated biological system, which is typically associated with better mental health outcomes.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards a higher CES-D score is comparatively limited. The primary indicator is the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score: 0.59), which classifies the participant's subjective sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This measure typically correlates positively with CES-D, suggesting a potential contributor to depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant reports slightly below-average engagement in socializing with friends (Z-score: -0.62) and low engagement in some recreational activities, which could be indicative of reduced social engagement. The slightly elevated mean daily naps (Z-score: 0.44) also correlates positively with CES-D. However, the magnitude of these concerns and the strength of their correlations with CES-D are generally weaker when compared to the substantial protective factors identified.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
The overwhelming weight of evidence strongly indicates that the participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is likely to be lower than the majority of the study population. The robust psychological profile, characterized by exceptionally low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness, represents powerful protective factors that are inversely and strongly correlated with CES-D scores. These protective psychological traits are further supported by healthy behavioral choices, particularly abstinence from substance use and regular participation in sports, and by well-regulated physiological circadian rhythms and consistent sleep timing. While the self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI) is a notable point of concern, it is counterbalanced by objective data showing regularity in sleep timing and an overall stable circadian system. Given the strength and number of indicators pointing towards resilience and positive well-being, it is most probable that this participant's CES-D score would fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a complex psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety and significantly low self-esteem. The STAI-Trait score of 52, which places the participant at 1.06 standard deviations above the population mean and is classified as ""anxious,"" demonstrates a heightened chronic anxiety proneness. This measure also holds a strong positive correlation (0.82) with the CES-D score, indicating a likely co-occurrence of these two symptom clusters. Concurrently, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 28, falling 1.43 standard deviations below the mean, suggests markedly reduced self-worth. This low self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with the CES-D score (-0.71), implying that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptomatology. While the participant reports higher-than-average current happiness (Z-score 0.55, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.46) and lower-than-average perceived stress (Z-score -1.26, positively correlated with CES-D at 0.28), these indicators are countered by lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.62) and lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.78), both of which show negative correlations with the CES-D score. Despite these emotional challenges, the participant maintains consistently high academic performance, indicated by GPAs ranging from 3.88 to 4.0, suggesting resilience or adaptive functioning in the academic domain. Their daily recreational habits lean towards passive activities, with above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score 1.28) and listening to music (Z-score 1.6), and no engagement in video games or reading. Substance use is moderate, and exercise frequency is moderate, neither appearing to be a significant deviation from the population mean.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reports subjective sleep disturbance as evidenced by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7, which generally indicates clinically significant sleep difficulties, even though the Z-score (0.13) is close to the population mean. Objectively, Fitbit data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 55 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.33) but approaches the recommended duration for adults. Notably, the participant demonstrates consistent sleep habits, with lower-than-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (70 minutes, Z-score -0.7) and sleep start time (55 minutes, Z-score -0.62). These objective measures of sleep consistency show weak positive correlations with CES-D, suggesting that less variability is associated with lower CES-D. The absence of napping (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86) also correlates weakly with lower depressive symptoms.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological metrics reveals patterns in the participant's circadian rhythm and cardiovascular activity. The Mesor, representing the participant's baseline heart rate (68.84 bpm, Z-score -0.7), and Resting Heart Rate (52.4 bpm, Z-score -0.68) are both lower than the study population average. These metrics show a weak positive correlation (0.19) with the CES-D score, implying that lower baseline heart rates are associated with lower depressive symptoms. The circadian rhythm exhibits slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.57) and near-average intraday variability (Z-score -0.25), neither of which is strongly correlated with CES-D. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed at 3:28 PM, which is a relatively later peak compared to typical circadian patterns. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal a characteristic diurnal pattern, with significant reductions in heart rate during sleep (e.g., -20.1 bpm at 5-6 am) and elevated heart rates during daytime activity, peaking in the early to mid-afternoon (e.g., 17.81 bpm above mesor at 1-2 pm). The z-scores for these hourly deviations show periods of both lower and higher activity relative to the population, but their correlations with the CES-D score are negligible, indicating no strong hourly physiological associations with depressive symptoms.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

To assess whether the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores, a holistic evaluation of the available evidence is necessary.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The most compelling indicators for elevated depressive symptomatology are the participant's self-reported anxiety and self-esteem. The STAI-Trait score is significantly elevated (Z=1.06, classified as ""anxious"") and exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, the Self-Esteem score is notably low (Z=-1.43) and carries a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores, meaning lower self-esteem is highly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the PSQI score of 7, indicating ""Disturbed Sleep,"" suggests a significant subjective sleep quality issue often linked with depression. Lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.62) and lower interpersonal trust (Z=-0.78), both weakly to moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, also lend some support to a higher symptom burden.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, some data points suggest a lower CES-D score. The participant reports lower-than-average perceived stress (Z=-1.26), which is positively correlated (0.28) with CES-D, indicating lower stress is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is higher than average (Z=0.55), with a moderate negative correlation (-0.46) to CES-D. From the wearable data, the participant's Mesor and Resting Heart Rate are lower than the population mean (Z=-0.7 and Z=-0.68, respectively), and both show a weak positive correlation (0.19) with CES-D, implying that lower values are associated with lower CES-D. Similarly, lower variability in sleep duration (Z=-0.7) and sleep start time (Z=-0.62), as well as no napping (Z=-0.86), are all weakly positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting these consistent sleep patterns might be associated with lower depressive symptoms. The participant's high academic achievement across multiple semesters could also be considered a protective factor.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When weighing the evidence, the highly impactful and strongly correlated psychological traits, specifically elevated anxiety and significantly low self-esteem, are the most indicative of a higher depressive symptom burden. These factors demonstrate substantial deviations from the population mean in directions strongly associated with higher CES-D scores. While the participant exhibits some positive indicators, such as lower perceived stress and higher happiness, the strength of their correlations with CES-D is not as pronounced as that of anxiety and self-esteem. Furthermore, the objective wearable metrics that point towards a lower CES-D score generally have weaker correlations. The presence of disturbed subjective sleep, despite objective sleep consistency, further supports the notion of internal distress. Therefore, the overall pattern of the most salient psychological data, especially the strong markers for anxiety and self-esteem, suggests that the participant is likely experiencing an elevated level of depressive symptoms.

The participant's self-reported psychological state indicates a complex profile, exhibiting both areas of strength and potential vulnerability. While the participant's score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is close to the population mean (Z-score: -0.13), it is classified as ""anxious,"" and notably, trait anxiety demonstrates a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores in the study population. This suggests that even average levels of anxiety in this individual may be closely linked to depressive symptomatology. Conversely, the participant reports high self-esteem, scoring at the maximum on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Score: 40.0, Z-score: 0.26), which is a significant protective factor given its very strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D scores. However, other subjective well-being measures paint a less positive picture; self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score: -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), indicating reduced subjective well-being. Perceived stress is higher than average (Z-score: 0.65) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.28). Furthermore, health satisfaction is considerably lower than the population mean (Z-score: -0.78) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting concerns regarding physical health and its potential impact on mood.

Behavioral patterns reveal reduced social engagement and exercise, alongside elevated internet usage. The participant reports socializing with friends for a very short duration daily (16-30 minutes), which is notably low compared to the study population (Z-score: -1.41). This low frequency of social interaction, while weakly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.01), is a salient behavioral pattern often associated with emotional difficulties. Exercise habits are also below average, particularly exercising alone (Z-score: -1.18). Conversely, internet usage is higher than the population mean (Z-score: 0.85) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.25), potentially serving as a compensatory activity or reflecting reduced engagement in other pursuits. Engagement in other recreational activities like reading, video games, and listening to music appears limited or less frequent than average. Substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) is generally low or non-existent for this participant, which is a positive health indicator.

Sleep patterns are characterized by subjective disturbance and objective variability. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, consistent with the participant's subjective experience. Wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours 7 minutes, which is close to the population average (Z-score: -0.08). However, the standard deviation of sleep duration is slightly elevated (108 minutes, Z-score: 0.17), indicating greater variability in nightly sleep length, which is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.20). The participant's median sleep start time is late (02:12:45), though the variability in this start time is slightly lower than average (Z-score: -0.23). Interestingly, this lower variability in sleep start time is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.22), potentially suggesting a consistently late, albeit rigid, sleep schedule that may contribute to overall sleep disturbance.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics reveals a notably suppressed cardiovascular profile and a somewhat disrupted circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits a significantly low mean heart rate (Mesor: 59.63 bpm, Z-score: -1.95) and resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z-score: -1.18) compared to the population. Both the Mesor and resting heart rate are weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), suggesting that for this individual, lower cardiovascular activity is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The amplitude of their heart rate rhythm (7.04, Z-score: -1.21) is also lower than average, indicating a flatter daily heart rate pattern with less pronounced peaks and troughs, which is weakly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.10). This further implies that a less robust diurnal heart rate variation is associated with higher depressive symptoms. While Interdaily Stability (0.43, Z-score: 0.17) is near average, Intradaily Variability (0.64, Z-score: 0.67) is higher than average, suggesting less consolidated periods of activity and rest. Despite the overall low absolute heart rate, the aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show a clear diurnal rhythm, with heart rate lowest in the early morning hours (e.g., -16.71 at 6-7 AM) and peaking in the afternoon/early evening (Acrophase: 4:51 PM, with peak deviation of 13.71 at 12-1 PM and sustained elevation until 9 PM). This indicates that the fundamental daily rhythm is preserved, but at a significantly lower baseline of physiological arousal.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence suggesting the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score.

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is extensive and spans self-report, behavioral, and physiological domains. The participant reports lower happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and lower health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.78), both of which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, implying a greater symptom burden. Perceived stress is elevated (Z-score: 0.65) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D. Although trait anxiety is average, its very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) suggests a potential exacerbating role for this individual. Behaviorally, extremely low social engagement (Z-score: -1.41) and reduced exercise frequency (Z-score: -1.18 for exercising alone) are prominent indicators, often associated with higher depressive symptoms. Elevated internet usage (Z-score: 0.85) also shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Sleep quality is poor (PSQI score of 7.0), and wearable data indicates higher variability in sleep duration (Z-score: 0.17), which is positively correlated with CES-D, as is a consistently late sleep start time. Physiologically, the participant exhibits a significantly low mesor (Z-score: -1.95), resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.18), and amplitude (Z-score: -1.21), with the low mesor and resting heart rate positively correlating with CES-D and lower amplitude negatively correlating with CES-D, all pointing towards a higher symptom burden. Additionally, higher intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.67) suggests fragmented activity patterns, which can be linked to mood disturbances.

Conversely, the primary evidence for a lower or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) comes from the participant's strong self-esteem (Z-score: 0.26), which is very strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Average interpersonal trust (Z-score: -0.14) also presents a moderate negative correlation with CES-D, offering some resilience. Low substance usage further removes a common risk factor for elevated depressive symptoms.

While high self-esteem is a powerful protective factor, the cumulative weight of multiple indicators—including low happiness, high stress, disturbed sleep, severe social isolation, reduced physical activity, and a suppressed and less dynamic cardiovascular rhythm—all aligning with higher depressive symptomatology, strongly suggests an elevated symptom burden. The sheer number and magnitude of these convergent observations, many with substantial Z-scores, outweigh the moderating effect of high self-esteem. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall into the top half of the population distribution for CES-D scores.

The participant presents a mixed psychological profile, demonstrating some vulnerabilities alongside significant strengths in health behaviors and physiological regulation. While trait anxiety is slightly elevated (STAI score of 43.0, Z-score of 0.17), classifying the individual as 'anxious,' and self-esteem is below average (Score 33.0, Z-score of -0.73), both of which show strong correlations with higher depressive symptoms (STAI r=0.81, Self-Esteem r=-0.71), other self-reported measures offer a more positive outlook. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score of 0.55, correlated negatively with CES-D at r=-0.46) and below-average perceived stress (Z-score of -0.44, weakly positively correlated with CES-D at r=0.28, implying lower stress is associated with lower depressive symptoms). Notably, satisfaction with physical health is significantly high (Z-score of 0.97, correlated negatively with CES-D at r=-0.39), suggesting a robust positive perception of their physical well-being. Trust is slightly below average (Z-score of -0.14, moderately negatively correlated with CES-D at r=-0.41).

Sleep patterns reveal a discrepancy between subjective experience and objective consistency. The self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score of 0.13) indicates 'Disturbed Sleep,' suggesting subjective difficulties. However, wearable data reveal highly consistent sleep habits. The standard deviation of sleep duration (35 minutes, Z-score of -1.5) and sleep start time (35 minutes, Z-score of -1.06) are both significantly below the population average, indicating exceptional regularity in when the participant sleeps and for how long. The median sleep duration is 6 hours and 56 minutes (Z-score of -0.31), which is slightly below the population average, with a median sleep start time of 01:57 AM. Infrequent napping (Z-score of -0.02) further supports a pattern of consistent, consolidated nighttime sleep. The high consistency in sleep parameters is generally considered a strong protective factor against depressive symptoms (sleep duration SD correlated at r=0.2, sleep start time SD correlated at r=0.22; lower SD implies lower CES-D).

Lifestyle behaviors are characterized by high levels of physical activity and moderate substance use. The participant engages in significantly more exercise than the population average, both alone (Z-score of 1.07) and with others (Z-score of 1.23), and also participates in sports (Z-score of 0.91). These exercise habits are weakly to moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, indicating their protective potential. Substance use involves moderate alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, both Z-scores around 1.0), but importantly, no recreational or non-prescribed drug use (both Z-scores below average, weakly positively correlated with lower CES-D). Daily recreation is varied, including above-average video game play (Z-score of 0.96) and listening to music (Z-score of 0.67), alongside engagement in a sedentary hobby for 1-2 hours (Z-score of 1.41). Overall, the high engagement in physical activity stands out as a significant positive behavioral pattern.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices depict a robust and well-regulated circadian system. The participant exhibits a below-average resting heart rate (53.2 bpm, Z-score of -0.59), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, which weakly correlates positively with CES-D (r=0.19, implying lower RHR is associated with lower CES-D). The heart rate circadian rhythm displays significantly high interdaily stability (Z-score of 1.0) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score of 1.06), coupled with significantly low intradaily variability (Z-score of -0.81), all pointing to a highly regular and predictable daily physiological rhythm. Furthermore, the heart rate amplitude (14.65, Z-score of 1.25) is notably robust, reflecting a pronounced difference between peak and trough heart rates, which is typically associated with better health and resilience. The hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a clear pattern of activity, with significant drops during sleep hours (e.g., -26.79 at 4-5 AM) and substantial peaks during waking and evening hours (e.g., 18.9 at 9-10 PM, Z-score of 1.9). This strong and consistent physiological rhythm, coupled with healthy resting heart rate metrics, suggests a resilient physiological foundation.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant exhibits a complex profile with indicators pointing towards both higher and lower depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. Evidence suggesting a potentially higher CES-D score includes slightly elevated trait anxiety, below-average self-esteem (both strongly correlated with CES-D), and self-reported disturbed sleep quality. The participant also shows slightly below-average trust, slightly shorter sleep duration, and a slightly higher mean heart rate (Mesor).

However, a substantial body of evidence points towards factors protective against higher depressive symptomatology, many of which are objectively measured and display significant deviations from the population mean. These include above-average happiness, below-average perceived stress, and notably high satisfaction with physical health. Behaviorally, the participant engages in significantly high levels of exercise and abstains from recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Physiologically, the objective sleep data reveal exceptionally high consistency in both sleep duration and start time. Furthermore, the heart rate circadian rhythm is remarkably stable and robust, characterized by high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, strong 24-hour autocorrelation, and a pronounced amplitude, alongside a healthy, below-average resting heart rate. These robust physiological and behavioral patterns are strong indicators of resilience and overall well-being.

While the strong correlations of trait anxiety and self-esteem with CES-D are concerning, the participant's actual scores on these measures (STAI Z=0.17, Self-Esteem Z=-0.73) are not in the extreme ranges. In contrast, the magnitude of positive deviations for protective factors, such as exercise (Z-scores > 1.0) and sleep/circadian rhythm consistency and amplitude (Z-scores up to -1.5 and 1.25, respectively), are very substantial. These objective and behavioral strengths suggest a considerable capacity for mood regulation and resilience that would likely buffer against elevated depressive symptoms. The combination of high physical activity, exceptional sleep regularity, and robust physiological rhythms, along with a positive perception of health, strongly indicates a profile associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Therefore, despite some psychological vulnerabilities, the overall evidence suggests the participant's CES-D score would likely fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral profile indicates a pattern generally associated with strong mental well-being and adaptive lifestyle choices. Subjective measures reveal notably low levels of trait anxiety, as evidenced by a STAI score of 24.0 (Z-score -1.71), which is classified as ""not anxious."" This low anxiety score correlates positively (0.81) with lower CES-D scores, suggesting a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Similarly, perceived stress is exceptionally low, with a PSS score of 10.0 (Z-score -3.16), aligning with reduced psychological burden. This individual also reports high self-esteem (RSES score 47.0, Z-score 1.24) and current happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), both of which inversely correlate with CES-D scores (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively). Academic performance is consistently high, with recent GPAs of 3.82. Furthermore, the participant reports high satisfaction with their physical health (score 7.0, Z-score 2.05), which also negatively correlates with CES-D. These combined self-report measures present a robust picture of psychological resilience and positive affect.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active and engaged lifestyle. They report exercising alone and with others ""three times a week or more,"" with high positive Z-scores (1.07 and 1.23, respectively), and engaging in sports with similar frequency (Z-score 1.58). This high level of physical activity is generally recognized as a protective factor for mental health. In contrast, engagement in passive leisure activities such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, internet usage, and listening to music is notably low or non-existent, often with negative Z-scores, indicating a preference for more active or social pursuits. Socializing with friends is reported at an average level (1-2 hours daily, Z-score 0.16). Substance usage involves moderate consumption of beer, wine, or liquor (1-2 times a week, Z-scores around 1.0), but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. The overall pattern suggests a structured, physically active daily routine with limited sedentary screen time, which is typically associated with better mental health outcomes.

Sleep patterns, as captured by both self-report and wearable data, are highly favorable. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), categorized as ""Good Sleep."" Objective Fitbit data corroborates this, showing a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 11 minutes, which is significantly longer than the population average (Z-score 1.25). Furthermore, sleep duration and sleep start times are notably consistent, indicated by lower standard deviations (87 minutes for duration, Z-score -0.32; 65 minutes for start time, Z-score -0.39), suggesting a regular sleep-wake schedule. The participant also reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86). These consistent and ample sleep patterns are generally conducive to positive mental health and inversely correlated with depressive symptoms.

Physiological data derived from wearable heart rate monitoring further supports a profile of good physical health. The participant exhibits a low resting heart rate (52.7 bpm, Z-score -0.65) and a low heart rate Mesor (67.99, Z-score -0.81), both indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal a clear and robust diurnal rhythm. Heart rate shows a strong increase in the morning, with significant positive deviations from 6-7 AM (Z-score 3.07) and 7-8 AM (Z-score 2.69), suggesting an active and early start to the day. The acrophase, or peak of heart rate activity, occurs at 2:19 PM. While some circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability (0.28, Z-score -1.07) and Amplitude (7.58, Z-score -1.03), are below the population average, indicating potentially less pronounced or stable daily rhythms, their correlations with CES-D scores are negligible within this dataset. This suggests that these specific aspects of circadian rhythmicity may not be strong indicators of depressive symptoms for this individual in this context. Intradaily Variability is slightly above average (0.65, Z-score 0.74), but its correlation with CES-D is also negligible. Overall, the heart rate patterns reflect a healthy and active physiological state with well-defined daily activity periods.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The overwhelming majority of evidence supports the conclusion that this participant's CES-D score would fall into the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.
*   **Psychological Well-being:** The participant exhibits extremely low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.71) and very low perceived stress (PSS Z-score -3.16). They report high levels of self-esteem (Z-score 1.24) and happiness (Z-score 1.64), and express high satisfaction with their health (Z-score 2.05). These are strong indicators of positive mental health, and their correlations with CES-D are consistently negative (STAI: 0.81, meaning low STAI = low CES-D; Self-Esteem: -0.71; Happy: -0.46; Health Satisfaction: -0.39), with stress being weakly positive (0.28), meaning lower stress = lower CES-D.
*   **Behavioral Habits:** The participant engages in high levels of physical exercise (Z-scores > 1.0 for all categories), a factor generally protective against depression. They maintain a healthy academic performance (GPA 3.82) and avoid recreational drug use.
*   **Sleep Health:** Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" (PSQI Z-score -0.8), complemented by objective Fitbit data showing long median sleep duration (8h 11m, Z-score 1.25) and consistent sleep patterns (low standard deviations for duration and start time). Consistent, ample sleep is a robust indicator of well-being.
*   **Physiological Indicators:** Low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.65) and Mesor (Z-score -0.81) suggest excellent cardiovascular fitness. The hourly heart rate data reveals a strong and consistent diurnal rhythm, including a significant morning activation.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
There is very limited evidence to suggest a high CES-D score for this participant.
*   Some wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics, specifically Interdaily Stability (Z-score -1.07) and Amplitude (Z-score -1.03), are below the population average, and Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.74) is above average. While these deviations might suggest a less robust circadian rhythm, their correlations with CES-D in this dataset are negligible (-0.01, -0.11, -0.05 respectively), indicating they are not significant predictors of higher depressive symptoms in this context.
*   Moderate alcohol consumption (Z-scores around 1.0) is reported, but its correlation with CES-D is also negligible (-0.05, -0.02).
*   No other data points, across self-report, behavioral, or physiological domains, provide substantial evidence that would indicate an elevated CES-D score.

**Holistic Conclusion:**
The cumulative evidence overwhelmingly points towards a profile indicative of strong mental and physical health, high levels of well-being, and adaptive behavioral patterns. Key psychological indicators such as very low anxiety and stress, high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction are strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, excellent sleep quality and consistency, high physical activity, and robust cardiovascular health provide significant protective factors. The few data points that are below population average (e.g., certain circadian rhythm parameters) have negligible correlations with CES-D, meaning they do not weigh significantly in predicting depressive symptoms. Given the confluence of exceptionally positive indicators across all domains, it is highly probable that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The population median CES-D is 11.5, and this participant's profile strongly suggests a score well below this threshold.

The participant presents a mixed psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by significant strengths in some domains alongside notable areas of concern relevant to depressive symptomatology. Psychologically, the individual reports very low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.31) and higher-than-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score 1.1), happiness (Z-score 1.64), and health satisfaction (Z-score 1.96). These self-reported positive traits are strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D scores in the study population, suggesting they act as protective factors. Academically, the participant maintains consistently good GPA scores, indicating effective functioning in this core university demand. Conversely, the participant reports exceptionally high perceived stress (PSS Z-score 2.28) and very low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.71), both of which are strongly correlated with elevated depressive symptoms, suggesting significant internal and social stressors.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains some healthy habits, notably reporting no substance usage and engaging in regular solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07). However, social physical activity is absent, with no exercise with others or sports participation, which could limit social engagement benefits. Sedentary behaviors are prominent, with higher-than-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (3-4 hours, Z-score 2.54) and on internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.52). Both of these activities are positively correlated with CES-D scores. Despite this, the participant also reports a higher-than-average amount of time socializing with friends (2-3 hours), indicating a balance between solitary and social engagement, though the sedentary nature of some solitary activities stands out.

Sleep and circadian rhythm data offer a complex picture. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), placing them below the threshold for clinical sleep disturbance. However, objective Fitbit data contradicts this with significantly short median sleep duration (6 hours 7 minutes, Z-score -1.33) and notably high variability in sleep duration (142 minutes, Z-score 0.94), which are both risk factors for depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits a relatively consistent sleep start time, partially mitigating the variability. Increased mean daily napping (Z-score 0.7) may represent a compensatory mechanism for insufficient nighttime sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate show a lower-than-average mesor and resting heart rate, typically indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. However, the heart rate amplitude is lower than average (Z-score -1.52), suggesting a somewhat blunted physiological rhythm, which has a negative correlation with CES-D, indicating that a lower amplitude is associated with higher CES-D. Interdaily stability is also lower than average, reflecting less day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns.

The hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. While nocturnal heart rates are appropriately low relative to the mesor, there is an exceptionally sharp and early increase in heart rate deviation during the early morning hours. Specifically, the period between 5-6 AM shows an extreme elevation (Z-score 6.2), followed by another significant increase from 6-7 AM (Z-score 4.31). This highly pronounced and early physiological activation, indicative of early morning hyperarousal or intense activity, is a notable feature. Throughout the rest of the day, heart rate deviations from the mesor are generally positive but return to more typical or even slightly subdued levels relative to the population. This pronounced early morning surge, in the context of objectively short and variable sleep, suggests a potential physiological dysregulation, even with a relatively healthy resting heart rate.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) includes the participant's low trait anxiety (Z-score -1.31), high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1), high happiness (Z-score 1.64), and high health satisfaction (Z-score 1.96), all of which are protective factors strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D. Their self-reported ""good sleep"" on the PSQI, consistent academic performance, absence of substance use, regular solitary exercise, and relatively consistent sleep start time also contribute to a profile less indicative of high depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a lower resting heart rate and mesor (Z-scores -0.52 and -1.04 respectively) are generally associated with better cardiovascular health and lower CES-D.

Conversely, significant evidence points towards a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile). The participant's extremely high perceived stress (Z-score 2.28) and remarkably low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.71) are potent risk factors, with correlations indicating a strong association with higher CES-D scores. Objective sleep metrics from Fitbit reveal significantly short median sleep duration (Z-score -1.33) and notably high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.94), which are both robust predictors of depressive symptoms. The lower-than-average circadian heart rate amplitude (Z-score -1.52) also correlates with increased CES-D. Behavioral patterns such as high sedentary screen time (TV/Videos/Movies Z-score 2.54; Internet Usage Z-score 1.52), which are positively correlated with CES-D, along with a higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.7) that may compensate for poor nighttime sleep, further suggest an elevated symptom burden. The observed extreme early morning heart rate hyperarousal could also signify physiological stress or dysregulation.

Holistically, while the participant exhibits robust psychological strengths in terms of anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness, the magnitude of perceived stress and lack of interpersonal trust are exceptionally high. These subjective and social factors are compounded by objective and significant sleep disturbances (short duration, high variability, blunted physiological rhythm) that contradict the self-reported good sleep quality. The correlations consistently indicate that these problematic aspects are associated with elevated CES-D scores. The combined weight of very high perceived stress, very low trust, and objective sleep dysregulation, along with specific sedentary behaviors, strongly suggests that the participant is experiencing a significant burden of depressive symptoms that would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents a complex profile of psychological well-being, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological regulation. Psychologically, the individual reports higher than average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), happiness (Z-score 0.55), and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.22), all of which are negatively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting a protective role against depressive symptoms. However, these positive indicators are tempered by significantly elevated perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale score 25.0, Z-score 0.92) and below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.78), with trust showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D. Furthermore, despite a slightly below-average trait anxiety score relative to the study population (STAI Z-score -0.13), the participant is classified as ""anxious,"" and trait anxiety exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores.

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates consistent academic success with an increasing GPA trend, suggesting good cognitive and functional capacity within an academic setting. Substance use across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""not at all,"" placing the participant significantly below the population average for these behaviors, which is generally a positive health indicator. Conversely, engagement in physical exercise, whether alone or with others, is less frequent than peers (Z-scores -0.43 and -0.17 respectively). The participant exhibits highly selective recreational habits, reporting no engagement in watching TV/videos, video games, reading, or other sedentary hobbies, but engaging significantly more in listening to music (Z-score 1.13) and moderately in socializing with friends.

Physiologically, the participant displays robust and highly regular sleep and circadian rhythms. Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, is at the threshold for clinically significant sleep disturbance (score 5.0) but is notably better than the average for the study population (Z-score -0.8). Objective wearable data corroborate healthy sleep patterns, showing an average median sleep duration of 7 hours 14 minutes and remarkably low variability in sleep duration (Z-score -1.33), indicating high consistency. Circadian rhythm features derived from heart rate data also reflect strong physiological regulation, with high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75) and a pronounced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.15). The heart rate rhythm exhibits an above-average amplitude (Z-score 0.69), signifying robust physiological responsiveness across the day. The Mesor (overall mean heart rate) and resting heart rate are slightly elevated compared to the population mean (Z-scores 0.85 and 0.36 respectively), suggesting a slightly higher baseline cardiovascular activity. Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a typical diurnal pattern, with significant drops during typical sleep hours (e.g., -24.35 at 5-6 AM) and pronounced peaks during active periods (e.g., 16.36 at 1-2 PM, 18.72 at 6-7 PM), with some hourly peaks showing elevated activity relative to the study population (e.g., Z-scores >1.0 for 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM, and 6-7 PM), indicating active physiological engagement during waking hours.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**

The participant demonstrates several robust indicators typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Self-reported measures show above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), happiness (Z-score 0.55), and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22), all of which exhibit moderate to strong negative correlations with CES-D scores. Academically, the participant maintains high and improving GPAs. Lifestyle factors include very low to non-existent substance use. Objectively, sleep duration is adequate (7 hours 14 minutes) and highly consistent, with very low standard deviation (Z-score -1.33). Self-reported sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8) is better than the majority of the study population, despite being at the clinical threshold for sleep disturbance. Furthermore, wearable data reveal a highly stable and pronounced heart rate-based circadian rhythm, indicated by elevated Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.75) and Autocorrelation at 24 Hours (Z-score 1.15), reflecting strong physiological regulation.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**

Conversely, several significant indicators suggest an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports substantially higher perceived stress than the study population average (PSS score 25.0, Z-score 0.92), a known risk factor for depression, albeit with a weak positive correlation to CES-D in this dataset. Despite having a slightly below-average trait anxiety score (STAI Z-score -0.13), the participant is classified as ""anxious,"" and trait anxiety shows a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.78) also moderately correlates with higher CES-D scores. The participant's frequency of exercise is lower than that of their peers across all categories, which can be a contributing factor to poorer mental health. While objective sleep metrics are generally positive, the PSQI score of 5.0 falls at the common cutoff for clinically significant sleep disturbance, implying some level of sleep difficulty. Interestingly, greater consistency in sleep duration (Z-score -1.33 for SD) and average variability in sleep start time (Z-score -0.03 for SD) paradoxically show weak positive correlations (0.20 and 0.22 respectively) with CES-D, as does the absence of napping (Z-score -0.86, correlation 0.21). Additionally, the participant's Mesor and Resting Heart Rate are slightly elevated (Z-scores 0.85 and 0.36 respectively) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D, potentially indicating a higher baseline physiological arousal.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**

The participant presents a mixed profile, demonstrating significant resilience and good functional capacity in several domains alongside notable psychological vulnerabilities. While strong protective factors like high self-esteem, happiness, and robust physiological regulation (sleep and circadian rhythms) are present, the pervasive experience of significantly elevated perceived stress and a classification of ""anxious"" on the STAI are critical indicators of psychological distress. The extremely strong positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D (0.81) suggests that, despite the slightly below-average Z-score for anxiety within the population, the qualitative classification of ""anxious"" is highly salient for interpreting their depressive symptom burden. Combined with lower interpersonal trust and a PSQI score at the clinical disturbance threshold, these factors suggest a substantial internal struggle. Although the objective physiological data paint a picture of good health and regulation, the presence of these prominent psychological stressors, particularly the high perceived stress and anxiety, is more indicative of a higher overall burden of depressive symptoms than the average student in this study population.

The participant presents with a complex profile of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological rhythms. Psychologically, the participant reports above-average trait anxiety (STAI score of 44.0, Z-score 0.27), classified as anxious, which exhibits a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores within the study population. Concurrently, self-esteem (score 37.0, Z-score -0.17), interpersonal trust (score 3.0, Z-score -0.46), and self-reported happiness (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53) are all slightly below the population mean, each demonstrating a moderate to strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (-0.71, -0.41, and -0.46 respectively), suggesting that these lower levels could contribute to higher depressive symptomatology. Conversely, the participant reports significantly lower perceived stress (PSS score 17.0, Z-score -1.26) compared to peers, a factor that is moderately positively correlated with CES-D (0.29), indicating this lower stress level would typically be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (score 5.0, Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates (-0.39) with CES-D. Academically, GPA shows a slight decline over time, from 3.5 in Fall 2015 to 3.0 in Fall 2016. Substance usage is notably low across all categories, with Z-scores well below average, suggesting a conservative approach to recreational substances, though correlations with CES-D are minimal.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a high engagement in various activities. Exercise, both alone (Z-score 1.07) and with others (Z-score 1.23), as well as participation in sports (Z-score 1.58), are all reported at frequencies ""Three times a week or more,"" placing the participant significantly above average in physical activity. These activities generally exhibit negative correlations with CES-D. In terms of daily recreation, the participant engages in reading (Z-score 4.24), sedentary hobbies (Z-score 2.01), listening to music (Z-score 1.13), socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95), and video games (Z-score 0.96) for extended periods (2-3 hours for reading, sedentary hobbies, listening to music, and socializing; 16-30 minutes for video games), placing these activities notably above population averages. Internet usage is also slightly above average (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.18). The impact of these recreational habits on CES-D is mixed, with some showing slight positive and others slight negative correlations.

Sleep patterns present a notable divergence between subjective experience and objective wearable data. Subjectively, the participant reports good sleep quality (PSQI score 5.0, Z-score -0.8), placing them below the common clinical cutoff for sleep disturbance. However, objective Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 38 minutes (Z-score -0.69), indicating shorter than average sleep. More critically, the participant exhibits exceptionally high variability in sleep duration (Standard Deviation 242 minutes, Z-score 3.21) and sleep start time (Standard Deviation 153 minutes, Z-score 1.54). Both of these variability metrics show positive correlations with CES-D (0.19 and 0.21, respectively), indicating that greater inconsistency in sleep is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The participant does not report daily napping (Z-score -0.86).

Analysis of circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data indicates a relatively stable rhythm, with Interdaily Stability (Value 0.49, Z-score 0.67) being above average, suggesting a consistent daily pattern of physiological activity. Intradaily Variability (Value 0.52, Z-score -0.18) is slightly below average, indicating less fragmentation within daily rhythms. The Mesor (71.99, Z-score -0.27), representing the mean heart rate, is slightly below average, with an Amplitude (11.99, Z-score 0.39) that is slightly above average, suggesting a robust fluctuation in heart rate across the day. The Acrophase, indicating the peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs at 4:17 PM. Hourly aggregate deviation from the Mesor reveals a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rate significantly dropping during late night/early morning hours (e.g., -22.85 bpm from 5-6am, Z-score -0.65) and rising during daytime, peaking around late morning to early afternoon (e.g., +15.43 bpm from 10-11am, Z-score 1.51, and +13.28 bpm from 2-3pm, Z-score 1.15). The resting heart rate (57.6 bpm, Z-score -0.07) is at the population average. While the overall circadian rhythm appears fairly regular based on stability and variability metrics, the specific timing of the Acrophase (4:17 PM) and the distribution of peak activity during the day align with general population patterns, showing periods of elevated physiological arousal during typical waking hours.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several characteristics commonly associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Notably, their perceived stress score is significantly below the study population average (Z-score -1.26), and perceived stress has a positive correlation (0.29) with CES-D, suggesting a protective factor against higher depressive scores. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is reported as ""Good Sleep"" with a score of 5.0 (Z-score -0.8), typically indicating fewer sleep disturbances. High engagement in various forms of exercise and sports, all above the population average (Z-scores ranging from 1.07 to 1.58), is generally associated with better mental health outcomes, often inversely correlated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39).

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Several robust indicators suggest the participant may experience elevated depressive symptoms. The most compelling evidence lies in the participant's above-average trait anxiety (STAI score 44.0, Z-score 0.27), which is very strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81). This suggests anxiety is a significant contributor to, or co-occurs with, depressive symptoms in this population. Additionally, slightly below-average self-esteem (Z-score -0.17), trust (Z-score -0.46), and happiness (Z-score -0.53) are all moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71, -0.41, -0.46, respectively), implying that these lower levels contribute to a higher CES-D score. A critical finding from the wearable data is the exceptionally high variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 3.21) and sleep start time (Z-score 1.54). Both of these metrics demonstrate positive correlations with CES-D (0.19 and 0.21), strongly indicating that inconsistent sleep patterns are associated with higher depressive symptoms. This objective irregularity in sleep contrasts with the participant's self-reported ""Good Sleep,"" highlighting a potential discrepancy between perception and physiological reality that can be relevant to mental health. The median sleep duration is also shorter than average (Z-score -0.69).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits several protective factors such as low perceived stress, good subjective sleep quality, and high levels of physical activity, these are counterbalanced by significant risk factors. The strong positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D, combined with the participant's above-average anxiety, is a potent indicator of elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the objective data on sleep highly variable sleep duration and start times, despite self-reported good sleep quality, are strongly associated with higher CES-D scores. The slightly diminished self-esteem, trust, and happiness also contribute to this picture. The overall pattern suggests that despite some healthy behaviors and perceptions, the underlying psychological vulnerabilities (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness) and objective physiological dysregulation (sleep variability) are likely more influential in determining depressive symptom burden. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom burden is likely in the top half of the study population.

29257,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally favorable psychological profile across several self-reported measures. Anxiety, as assessed by the STAI–Trait scale, is notably low (Score: 31.0, Z-score: -1.02, classified as ""not anxious""), indicating a stable disposition towards low anxiety proneness. This is complemented by high self-esteem (Score: 46.0, Z-Score: 1.1), placing the participant well above the population average. Perceived stress is also below average (Score: 19.0, Z-score: -0.71), and health satisfaction is high (Score: 5.22, Z-score: 0.72). The participant also reports an above-average degree of interpersonal trust (Score: 3.67, Z-Score: 0.83). However, a notable exception is the participant's self-reported current happiness, which is slightly below the population average (Score: 3.0, Z-Score: -0.53).

In terms of lifestyle and behavioral patterns, the participant demonstrates consistent academic performance with solid GPAs across academic semesters. Substance usage is moderate, with beer consumption slightly above average (1-2 times a week, Z-Score: 1.01) and other substances at or below population norms. The participant engages in regular exercise, both alone and with others (1-2 times a week for both), with exercising with others being slightly more frequent than average (Z-Score: 0.53). Recreational habits present a somewhat mixed picture; while there is very high engagement in listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-Score: 2.06), there is notably low engagement in other common leisure activities such as watching TV/videos, internet usage, socializing with friends, reading, and sedentary hobbies, all falling below the population average. The lower frequency of socializing (Z-score: -0.62) stands out against an otherwise largely positive self-reported well-being.

Sleep architecture and quality, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, are generally good, yet with some specific variations. Subjective sleep quality is rated as ""Good Sleep"" by the PSQI (Score: 4.0, Z-Score: -1.26), indicating minimal self-reported sleep disturbance. Wearable data supports above-average median sleep duration of 7 hours and 49 minutes (Z-Score: 0.79). The participant rarely naps (Mean Daily Naps: 0.0, Z-Score: -0.86). However, there is a comparatively high standard deviation in sleep duration (151 minutes, Z-Score: 1.14), suggesting considerable day-to-day variability in total sleep time. Sleep start time variability is average (82 minutes, Z-Score: -0.03), with a relatively late median sleep start time of 01:32:30.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological metrics reveals specific patterns in circadian rhythm and daily arousal. The participant's heart rate MESOR (72.96 bpm, Z-Score: -0.13) and resting heart rate (59.2 bpm, Z-Score: 0.12) are close to the population average. However, the circadian rhythm exhibits lower interdaily stability (Value: 0.26, Z-Score: -1.23) and a lower amplitude (Value: 8.46, Z-Score: -0.75) compared to the population, which may suggest a less robust or a somewhat flattened daily physiological rhythm despite exhibiting higher 24-hour autocorrelation (Value: 0.42, Z-Score: 0.81). Examination of the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates a pattern of deeply suppressed heart rates during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -15.09 bpm at 6-7 AM, Z-score: 0.3), suggesting profound rest. Conversely, during several waking hours throughout the day, the participant's heart rate elevation relative to their mesor is less pronounced compared to the general study population (e.g., 9-10 AM, Z-score: -1.06; 11-12 PM, Z-score: -0.75; 6-7 PM, Z-score: -0.86), which could reflect generally lower levels of physiological arousal or energy engagement during these periods.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial, primarily derived from self-reported psychological measures. The participant reports significantly lower anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02) and higher self-esteem (Z-score: 1.1), which are very strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (correlations of 0.81 and -0.71, respectively). Additionally, good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z-score: -1.26), low perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.71), high health satisfaction (Z-score: 0.72), and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83) all align with lower depressive symptomatology, given their moderate to weak negative correlations with CES-D. Wearable data shows above-average sleep duration (Z-score: 0.79) and fewer naps than average (Z-score: -0.86), with both factors having either no or a positive correlation with CES-D, implying these contribute to lower CES-D scores.

Conversely, some evidence points towards a potentially higher CES-D score. The participant reports lower-than-average current happiness (Z-score: -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting this factor could contribute to elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, wearable sleep data indicates a high standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score: 1.14), which positively correlates with CES-D (0.21), linking greater sleep variability to higher depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm metrics show lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.23) and a lower amplitude (Z-score: -0.75), which, while having very weak correlations with CES-D, are generally associated with poorer physiological regulation and could be subtle indicators. The pattern of lower physiological arousal during several daytime hours, as inferred from hourly heart rate deviations, could also suggest reduced energy or engagement, which might align with certain depressive symptoms, though the correlations with CES-D for these specific hourly metrics are negligible.

Considering all available evidence, the strong negative correlations between CES-D and the participant's high self-esteem and low anxiety are particularly impactful. These factors, alongside good subjective sleep quality, low stress, and high health satisfaction, collectively present a robust profile indicative of lower depressive symptom burden. While the participant reports below-average current happiness and exhibits higher variability in sleep duration, these elements are outweighed by the more strongly correlated positive indicators from self-report measures. Therefore, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

49539,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by notable resilience and well-being across several key self-report measures. Trait anxiety, as assessed by the STAI, is exceptionally low (Z-score = -1.81), placing the individual significantly below the population mean and reflecting a robust psychological state, which correlates strongly with lower depressive symptoms (r = 0.81). Self-esteem is notably high (Z-score = 0.96), a factor with a substantial negative correlation to CES-D scores (r = -0.71). Similarly, a high degree of interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83) and strong satisfaction with physical health (Z-score = 0.80) are observed, both negatively correlated with depressive symptom burden (r = -0.41 and r = -0.39, respectively). Academic performance has shown consistent improvement over academic semesters, culminating in a high GPA of 3.93 in Fall 2016, indicative of effective functioning. Perceived stress levels are average (Z-score = 0.10). While self-reported happiness is slightly below the population mean (Z-score = -0.53), this is the only self-report measure among these trait indicators that suggests a potential area of mild concern. The complete absence of substance use further supports a generally healthy lifestyle.

The participant's sleep and circadian rhythm profile presents a complex picture of consistency alongside significant fragmentation and delayed timing. Objectively, median sleep duration is average at 7 hours and 20 minutes (Z-score = 0.18), and both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit low variability (Z-scores = -1.47 and -0.96, respectively), indicating a highly consistent sleep schedule. However, the median sleep start time of 01:45:29 is notably late. This late onset aligns with the self-reported PSQI score of 6.0, which, despite an average Z-score (-0.33), is classified as 'Disturbed Sleep' and commonly indicates clinically significant sleep difficulties. Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian metrics reveals above-average interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.75), signifying a relatively stable day-to-day rhythm. Conversely, intradaily variability is exceptionally high (Z-score = 2.01), suggesting significant fragmentation in the daily activity and rest cycles. This fragmentation, alongside a relatively late acrophase (5:26 PM) for peak heart rate, implies a dysregulation in the physiological rhythm, even if overall regularity is maintained.

Behavioral data indicates a nuanced engagement in physical and recreational activities. The participant reports low frequency for general exercise performed alone or with others but actively engages in sports 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.91), suggesting targeted physical activity. Leisure habits show limited time spent on many common recreational activities, including watching TV, video games, listening to music, and notably, socializing with friends (Z-score = -0.62). Hourly heart rate patterns reflect typical daily variations, with expected lower rates during early morning hours and higher rates during daytime activity. A particularly salient physiological finding is the extremely high aggregate heart rate deviation from mesor between 11 PM and 12 AM (Z-score = 4.79). This indicates substantial and chronic physiological arousal during a period typically associated with pre-sleep winding down. This extreme nocturnal arousal, combined with a consistently late sleep onset and high intradaily variability, points towards a pattern of dysregulated physiological states that could negatively impact restorative processes and overall well-being, despite the consistent duration of sleep. The participant also demonstrates excellent cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a low Mesor heart rate (Z-score = -1.57) and resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.23).

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant demonstrates a robust psychological profile strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Their STAI score is exceptionally low (Z-score = -1.81), indicating very low trait anxiety, which has a substantial positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Similarly, high self-esteem (Z-score = 0.96), high interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83), and high health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.80) are observed, all negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71, -0.41, and -0.39, respectively). Academic performance is strong and improving, and there is no reported substance use. Furthermore, objective measures show excellent cardiovascular health (low Mesor and resting heart rate) and consistent sleep duration with low variability. The above-average interdaily stability also suggests a regular overarching circadian pattern.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Several indicators suggest potential challenges that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.53), which has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.46). The PSQI score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep, largely driven by a consistently late sleep start time (01:45:29). Objectively, heart rate data reveals extremely high intradaily variability (Z-score = 2.01), suggesting significant fragmentation of activity and rest cycles, a common feature in mood disorders. Most notably, an anomalous and extremely high heart rate deviation from mesor occurs between 11 PM and 12 AM (Z-score = 4.79), indicating substantial physiological arousal during a period typically reserved for winding down before sleep. Limited engagement in general exercise and socializing with friends also represent areas that could increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile presents a compelling combination of strong psychological protective factors and significant physiological dysregulation. The robust self-report data, particularly the exceptionally low anxiety and high self-esteem, trust, and health satisfaction, are all strongly correlated with *lower* CES-D scores. These factors suggest a foundational psychological resilience. While there are clear physiological markers of circadian disruption—specifically the very high intradaily variability, consistently late sleep onset, and profound nocturnal physiological arousal—the direct correlations of these specific metrics with CES-D in the provided dataset are weak or not specified as strong. Given the strong and consistent evidence from multiple psychological trait measures that are highly predictive of lower depressive symptom burden, these factors likely exert a dominant influence on the participant's overall CES-D score. Therefore, despite the physiological concerns, the participant's CES-D score is most likely to be in the lower range.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates several areas of potential concern, particularly those strongly associated with depressive symptoms. The individual reports high trait anxiety (STAI score 53.0, Z-score 1.16), classifying them as anxious relative to the study population. This elevated anxiety exhibits a strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (RSES score 30.0, Z-score -1.15), a finding that is also strongly and negatively correlated (-0.71) with CES-D. Further indicating psychological distress, the participant reports low current happiness (Z-score -1.61) and very low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.07), both of which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D scores. Perceived stress is slightly above the population average (PSS score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), aligning with a positive, albeit weaker, correlation with CES-D (0.28). Additionally, satisfaction with physical health is somewhat below average (Z-score -0.62) and negatively correlated with CES-D. These combined psychological traits present a pattern often associated with increased depressive symptomatology.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates a pronounced lack of physical activity, reporting ""Not at all"" for exercise both alone and with others, as well as for sports, resulting in very low Z-scores across these categories. This absence of exercise aligns with behavioral patterns sometimes observed in individuals experiencing mood disturbances. Conversely, the participant reports no substance use across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs), suggesting a lack of substance-related coping mechanisms. Engagement in many recreational activities, such as watching TV/videos/movies, video games, listening to music, reading, and sedentary hobbies, is also reported as ""Do not do"" or similarly low, which could suggest reduced interest or anhedonia. However, the participant reports above-average internet usage (Z-score 0.85) and socializes with friends for 2-3 hours daily (Z-score 0.95), suggesting some engagement in social and digital activities, though the correlation of socializing with CES-D is near zero.

Sleep patterns reveal a significant reduction in total sleep duration. The participant's median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 49 minutes, which is markedly shorter than the population average (Z-score -1.69). Despite this brevity, the sleep duration exhibits high consistency, with a low standard deviation of 30 minutes (Z-score -1.61). The median sleep start time is late, at 01:34:29. Subjectively, the participant's sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI score 6.0), although this score's Z-score of -0.33 indicates it is not exceptionally poor relative to the study population. The participant reports no daily naps, which is lower than the population average (Z-score -0.86).

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicate a generally consistent and structured heart rate-based circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits higher than average interdaily stability (Z-score 1.0) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.06), suggesting a regular physiological rhythm across days. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.6). The overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is slightly above the population average (Z-score 0.37), as is the resting heart rate (Z-score 0.28). Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveals a clear diurnal pattern. Heart rates are lowest during the early morning hours (1 AM to 6 AM), consistent with a sleep period, dropping significantly below the resting heart rate. Following this trough, there is a sharp increase in heart rate during the morning (7 AM to 9 AM), indicating a rapid rise in physiological arousal. Heart rate generally remains elevated throughout the day, with peaks observed around 8-9 AM, 12-1 PM, and 5-6 PM, before gradually declining in the late evening, converging towards the mesor and subsequently falling below it during typical sleep hours. The acrophase, or peak time of the heart rate rhythm, is observed at 3:36 PM, which falls within a typical afternoon range for cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of this rhythm is near the population average (Z-score -0.06).

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is substantial, stemming primarily from multiple self-reported psychological measures. The participant exhibits significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 1.16) which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Similarly, low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.15) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Further support comes from low self-reported happiness (Z-score -1.61) and very low interpersonal trust (Z-score -2.07), both moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.4, respectively). Slightly elevated perceived stress (Z-score 0.38) and below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.62) also contribute to this pattern, with positive and negative correlations to CES-D, respectively. Objectively, the participant's significantly short median sleep duration (Z-score -1.69) and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI score 6.0) are commonly associated with depressive symptoms, even if the direct correlation of sleep duration with CES-D in this dataset is low. Behaviorally, the widespread lack of engagement in various recreational and exercise activities could suggest reduced motivation or anhedonia.

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is less prominent. The participant maintains high academic performance, and reports no substance use, which could be considered protective factors against severe depressive symptomatology. While the participant engages in socializing with friends above the population average, its correlation with CES-D is near zero, limiting its interpretive power in this context. Wearable data shows a highly stable heart rate-based circadian rhythm (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.0, 24-hour Autocorrelation Z-score 1.06), and highly consistent sleep duration (Z-score -1.61), which could suggest a degree of physiological regularity that is generally beneficial. However, the correlations between these circadian measures and CES-D are very low to negligible in this dataset, making them weak counterpoints to the strong psychological indicators.

Synthesizing the evidence, the highly consistent and strongly correlated self-report psychological metrics, including high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and low trust, present a compelling picture of elevated depressive symptom burden. These primary psychological indicators, robustly linked to CES-D scores in this study population, substantially outweigh the mixed or weak signals from behavioral and physiological measures such as circadian rhythm consistency or specific social habits, many of which have negligible correlations with CES-D in this dataset. Therefore, the overall pattern of the participant's data strongly suggests that their CES-D score falls into the top half of the study population distribution.

20335,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile, with self-reported psychological measures generally indicating strong well-being, while wearable data offers nuanced insights into physiological and behavioral patterns. On self-report, the participant scored notably low on trait anxiety (STAI Z-score = -1.81), classified as ""not anxious,"" a characteristic strongly inversely correlated with CES-D scores (r = 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem was remarkably high (RSES Z-score = 1.66), which negatively correlates with depressive symptoms (r = -0.71). Perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -0.71) was lower than the population average, and self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64) and overall health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.3) were both elevated, further reinforcing a positive psychological state with correlations that suggest a lower depressive symptom burden.

Behaviorally, the participant reports a healthy lifestyle characterized by frequent exercise, primarily alone (Z-score = 1.07), and significant social engagement, socializing with friends for 3-4 hours daily (Z-score = 1.74), which typically acts as a protective factor against depressive symptoms. While engagement in sedentary hobbies and video games is also high (Z-scores = 2.01 and 1.71, respectively), this coexists with active social and physical habits. Substance use involves moderate alcohol consumption (wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.94) but an absence of recreational or non-prescribed drug use. These activity patterns, particularly the high social interaction and exercise, align with a profile of generally effective coping and well-being.

Sleep data provides a mixed picture. Subjectively, the participant reports ""Good Sleep"" quality according to the PSQI (Z-score = -0.8). Objectively, Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 6 hours 35 minutes, which is somewhat shorter than the population average (Z-score = -0.74), though the correlation with CES-D is negligible. However, sleep start times are notably consistent (Standard Deviation Z-score = -1.24), suggesting a regular sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show high interdaily stability (Z-score = 1.33) and a relatively high amplitude (Z-score = 0.9), indicating a robust and regular physiological rhythm, which is generally associated with better health. The resting heart rate is also lower than average (55 bpm, Z-score = -0.37), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness.

A salient feature in the physiological data is the pattern of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor. While heart rate tends to decline during typical sleep hours, this participant exhibits an unusually high heart rate deviation in the late-night to early morning hours, particularly between 12-1 AM (Value = 23.89, Z-score = 3.66). This indicates a significant elevation in physiological arousal during a period when the body is typically winding down or engaged in deep sleep. This high arousal also extends to 10-11 PM (Z-score = 1.14) and 11-12 AM (Z-score = 1.53). This objective finding contrasts with the self-reported ""Good Sleep"" and suggests a consistent pattern of late-night activity or physiological activation, the implications of which for overall well-being would depend on its nature and subjective impact, which are not directly elucidated by the available data. However, the correlation for this 12-1 AM heart rate deviation with CES-D is negligible (-0.04), suggesting it may not be directly linked to depressive symptomatology in this participant within the context of the study population.

Based on the multimodal data, the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is likely to be in the bottom half of the study population distribution. The evidence for a relatively low or average CES-D score is substantial, primarily driven by consistently favorable self-report measures across multiple psychological domains, including very low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated happiness, lower perceived stress, and strong health satisfaction. These indicators have robust and expected correlations with CES-D, aligning with a lower depressive symptom profile. Furthermore, the participant engages in protective behavioral factors such as regular exercise and high levels of social interaction. Objectively, sleep quality is reported as good, and circadian rhythms are stable and robust, with a lower resting heart rate, generally indicative of good physiological regulation.

Conversely, evidence that might suggest a higher CES-D score is comparatively weak. While the participant experiences slightly shorter median sleep duration and exhibits high physiological arousal during late-night hours, the correlations of these specific metrics with CES-D are negligible, indicating they do not strongly predict depressive symptoms in this context. The high engagement in sedentary activities, while notable, is balanced by high social engagement and exercise, making it less likely to be a primary driver of depressive symptoms given the participant’s otherwise positive psychological profile.

Considering the strong and consistent evidence from multiple well-being measures that are highly relevant to depressive symptomatology, the pattern of psychological strengths significantly outweighs any potential concerns arising from specific physiological or behavioral patterns that have weak or negligible correlations with CES-D. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the bottom 50th percentile of the study population.

### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile generally suggests a comparatively robust mental state within the study population. Scores on the STAI-Trait scale indicate not anxious (Z-score = -1.41), significantly below the population mean, which typically correlates positively with lower depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Similarly, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is above average (score = 43.0, Z-score = 0.68), a factor strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.71), implying a lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress levels are also low (PSS score = 18.0, Z-score = -0.98), suggesting effective stress appraisal. Sleep quality, according to the PSQI, is categorized as good (score = 5.0, Z-score = -0.8). However, while overall indicators are positive, self-reported happiness is slightly below the population average (Z-score = -0.53), and this metric shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.46), suggesting a potential area of relative vulnerability. Interpersonal trust is near the population average (Z-score = -0.46). The participant also demonstrates strong academic performance, with consistently high GPAs.

In terms of lifestyle and health behaviors, the participant reports moderate alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, both with Z-scores around 1.0, indicating above-average frequency) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise habits are generally healthy and above average across categories, including exercising alone (Z-score = 0.32), exercising with others (Z-score = 0.53), and participating in sports (Z-score = 0.91). Daily recreational habits include above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies and socializing with friends (Z-score = 0.95), suggesting a relatively active social life. Time spent on internet usage, listening to music, and reading is below average. Health satisfaction is near the population average (Z-score = 0.13), and Body Mass Index is within a healthy range (22.11). These behavioral patterns, particularly high engagement in exercise and socializing, are generally associated with positive mental well-being.

Despite self-reported good sleep quality via PSQI, objective wearable data reveal significant irregularities in the participant's physiological circadian rhythm. Key circadian metrics derived from heart rate data show pronounced deviations from population norms, suggesting a dysregulated and fragmented rhythm. Interdaily stability is very low (value = 0.19, Z-score = -1.81), indicating a lack of day-to-day consistency in activity patterns. Concurrently, intradaily variability is high (value = 0.71, Z-score = 1.16), reflecting a more fragmented and less organized rhythm within each 24-hour period. Furthermore, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is significantly blunted (value = 5.05, Z-score = -1.85), meaning a reduced difference between peak and trough heart rates, and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is also very low (Z-score = -1.87), further confirming poor rhythmicity. The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:35 PM. While median total sleep duration is above average at 8 hours 3 minutes (Z-score = 1.08), the significant irregularity in the underlying physiological rhythm suggests an underlying pattern of dysregulation that is not fully captured by self-reported sleep quality or total sleep time. The standard deviation in sleep start time (Z-score = 0.28) and duration (Z-score = -0.21) are near average, indicating moderate consistency in sleep timing despite the broader circadian dysregulation. The participant also reports slightly above-average daily napping (Z-score = 0.82).

Analysis of heart rate patterns reveals an elevated resting heart rate (RHR = 75.5 bpm, Z-score = 2.06), significantly higher than the study population average. Similarly, the Mesor, representing the participant's mean heart rate across the recording period, is also elevated (82.2 bpm, Z-score = 1.13). These suggest a generally heightened state of physiological arousal or sympathetic nervous system activity. Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor further illustrates daily cardiovascular patterns. During typical sleep hours (approximately 3 AM to 7 AM), heart rate dips significantly below the Mesor, which is expected. However, for many waking hours, particularly from late morning through evening (e.g., 9 AM to 9 PM), the hourly deviations, while positive, exhibit Z-scores that are average or below average compared to the population, even if the absolute values are above the elevated RHR. This could suggest that despite a high baseline arousal (high RHR, Mesor), the *range* of daily physiological activity, as indicated by the blunted amplitude, is less pronounced than typically observed in the population, or that peak activity levels are not as high as peers. This combination of high baseline heart rate and blunted circadian amplitude could indicate a state of chronic physiological strain or reduced physiological adaptability.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence from the self-reported survey data strongly indicates a low depressive symptom burden for this participant. The STAI-Trait score, a measure of chronic anxiety, is significantly low (Z-score = -1.41) and shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), suggesting that low anxiety is highly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Similarly, the participant's self-esteem is above average (Z-score = 0.68) and exhibits a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), implying higher self-esteem is strongly linked to lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, perceived stress is considerably below average (Z-score = -0.98), and self-reported sleep quality via the PSQI is categorized as ""Good Sleep"" (Z-score = -0.8), both of which are generally associated with better mental health outcomes. Positive lifestyle factors, such as above-average engagement in exercise and socializing, also typically act as protective factors against depressive symptomatology. Objective median sleep duration is also above average (Z-score = 1.08).

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, several objective physiological metrics suggest potential underlying dysregulation, which is often associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant exhibits a significantly elevated resting heart rate (RHR = 75.5 bpm, Z-score = 2.06) and a higher overall mean heart rate (Mesor = 82.2 bpm, Z-score = 1.13), both of which show a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.2). More notably, there is profound disruption in several wearable-derived circadian rhythm features. Interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.81), 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = -1.87), and amplitude (Z-score = -1.85) are all significantly low, while intradaily variability (Z-score = 1.16) is high. This pattern signifies a highly irregular, fragmented, and blunted physiological rhythm. Although the correlations between these specific circadian metrics and CES-D for this participant are weak or near zero, such extensive physiological dysregulation is a well-established feature and risk factor for mood disorders, including depression, and represents a significant area of concern from a holistic perspective. Additionally, self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z-score = -0.53), with a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.46) suggesting it could contribute to a slightly higher CES-D score. Slightly above average napping (Z-score = 0.82) also correlates positively with CES-D (r=0.21), potentially indicating fatigue.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
When evaluating the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden as measured by the CES-D, a holistic analysis must weigh the strong, direct indicators from self-report against the profound, but less directly correlated, physiological dysregulation. The self-reported psychological measures (STAI, Self-Esteem, Perceived Stress, PSQI) consistently point towards a low prevalence of depressive symptoms, and these metrics show very strong correlations with CES-D in the provided data, indicating a clear inverse relationship with depressive symptom burden. While the objective physiological data reveal significant circadian rhythm disruption and elevated physiological arousal (high RHR, Mesor), which are generally associated with mood disorders, the provided correlations for these specific physiological metrics with CES-D for this participant are weak or non-existent. Given the task's emphasis on evaluating depressive symptoms *as measured by the CES-D domains* and the guidance that correlations are meant to *aid interpretation* but not *override holistic analysis*, the strong and direct self-report indicators of low anxiety, high self-esteem, and low stress, with their high predictive correlations to CES-D, exert a more immediate influence on the likely CES-D score. Despite the concerning physiological profile, the *current symptom burden* as assessed by CES-D-proximal measures appears low.

Therefore, the participant likely has a CES-D score in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by notably low levels of self-reported anxiety and perceived stress. Their STAI-Trait score (29.0, Z-score -1.22) is well below the population average, indicating a 'not anxious' classification, which is strongly negatively associated with depressive symptoms (correlation of 0.81 with CES-D, meaning lower anxiety is linked to lower CES-D). Similarly, their Perceived Stress Scale score (20.0, Z-score -0.44) is below average, suggesting less perceived stress, a factor moderately correlated with lower CES-D scores. Concurrently, the participant reports significantly higher self-esteem (RSES score 44.0, Z-score 0.82) and happiness (current happiness score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), both of which are strongly and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, respectively. Additionally, higher-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83) and a slightly below-average health satisfaction score (Z-score -0.53) are reported, with the latter showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D, suggesting a potential minor area of concern for well-being. Academically, the participant consistently maintains a high GPA, concluding with a perfect 4.0 in the 2016 Fall semester.

Behavioral patterns indicate a healthy and active lifestyle with specific preferences. Substance usage across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as ""not at all,"" corresponding to significantly negative Z-scores, indicating abstinence compared to the population average. Exercise habits show a strong preference for solitary activity, with the participant exercising alone three times a week or more (Z-score 1.07), while engaging less frequently in exercise with others (Z-score -0.88) or sports (Z-score -0.42). Daily recreational habits are distinctive, with significantly less engagement in passive activities like watching TV/videos (Z-score -1.25) and video games (Z-score -0.56). Conversely, the participant spends substantially more time listening to music (Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (Z-score 0.95), suggesting an active and socially engaged recreational life, although the positive correlation between music listening and CES-D could indicate music as a coping mechanism or simply a strong preference.

Analysis of sleep and physiological circadian rhythms reveals a generally robust and well-regulated pattern. Despite a self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, classifying sleep as 'Disturbed,' the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates objectively less subjective sleep disturbance than the average participant classified as disturbed within the study population. Wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 37 minutes, which is shorter than the population average (Z-score -0.7). However, this is accompanied by notably less variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 62 minutes, Z-score -0.87), implying greater consistency in sleep timing. The heart rate-based circadian rhythm is highly regular, evidenced by high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.33) and a robust Amplitude (Z-score 1.06), coupled with slightly lower Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.32). The acrophase, or peak activity time, is observed at 5:00 PM. Hourly aggregated heart rate data demonstrates a clear and pronounced diurnal rhythm, with consistently deep troughs during nighttime sleep (e.g., -26.06 bpm deviation at 6-7 AM, Z-score -1.21) and sustained, above-average elevations during daytime hours (e.g., 14.93 bpm deviation at 1-2 PM, Z-score 1.11), reflecting a well-defined and predictable pattern of physiological arousal and rest. The resting heart rate (57.3 bpm, Z-score -0.1) is slightly below the population average, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, while the Mesor (mean heart rate) is slightly higher (Z-score 0.76).

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits a strong psychological profile suggesting lower depressive symptomatology. Their significantly low STAI-Trait score (Z=-1.22) and PSS score (Z=-0.44), combined with their high self-esteem (Z=0.82), happiness (Z=1.64), and trust (Z=0.83), are all traits that are strongly or moderately correlated with lower CES-D scores in the study population. Behavioral indicators, such as very low substance use and regular exercise, including frequent solitary exercise (Z=1.07), further support a positive well-being status. Furthermore, the wearable data demonstrates a highly regular and robust circadian rhythm, characterized by high Interdaily Stability (Z=1.33) and Amplitude (Z=1.06), and low Intradaily Variability (Z=-0.32), all of which are generally associated with better mental health outcomes. Despite reporting some sleep disturbance on the PSQI, the participant's Z-score for PSQI is below average (Z=-0.33), suggesting they experience less subjective disturbance than the average disturbed sleeper. Crucially, their sleep duration, while slightly shorter than average, shows low variability (Z=-0.87), indicating consistency. The resting heart rate is also slightly below average (Z=-0.1), which typically correlates with better cardiovascular health.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Only a few metrics suggest potential concerns. The participant's self-reported health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z=-0.53), and its moderate negative correlation with CES-D could imply a slightly elevated CES-D score. The participant's median sleep duration (6 hours 37 minutes, Z=-0.7) is shorter than the population average, and reduced sleep duration can be a symptom of depression, although its correlation with CES-D is minimal (-0.01). The Mesor (mean heart rate) is higher than average (Z=0.76), with a moderate positive correlation (0.19) to CES-D, which could imply a higher baseline physiological arousal associated with elevated symptoms. Additionally, the participant's significantly increased time spent listening to music (Z=2.06) has a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (0.26), which could, in some contexts, suggest a coping mechanism for underlying mood issues.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that this participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, is likely in the bottom half of the study population. The robust indicators of positive psychological well-being (low anxiety/stress, high self-esteem/happiness/trust) are strongly correlated with lower CES-D scores. Behaviorally, minimal substance use and consistent exercise patterns, coupled with high social engagement, are protective factors. Physiologically, the highly stable and regular circadian rhythm, along with consistent sleep duration and a healthy resting heart rate, point to a well-regulated physiological system. While a few isolated metrics (e.g., slightly lower health satisfaction, shorter sleep duration, higher Mesor, increased music listening) might individually suggest minor vulnerabilities or coping behaviors, their magnitude and number are significantly outweighed by the numerous, strong, and consistently inter-correlated indicators of lower depressive symptomatology. Therefore, the overall picture strongly indicates a low or median CES-D score relative to their peers.

35344,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a self-reported psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety and diminished self-worth. Specifically, their STAI-Trait score (62.0, Z-score 2.05) indicates significantly higher chronic anxiety compared to the study population, a measure strongly correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Concurrently, their Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (27.0, Z-Score -1.57) reflects considerably lower self-esteem, which exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D scores (r=-0.71). This pattern is further supported by a notably low self-reported happiness score (2.0, Z-Score -1.61, r=-0.46) and a moderately elevated perceived stress level (PSS score 24.0, Z-Score 0.65, r=0.28). Subjective sleep quality is reported as poor, with a PSQI score of 9.0 (Z-Score 1.05), classifying their sleep as disturbed, aligning with a common symptom of psychological distress.

In terms of behavioral engagement, the participant reports a trend of declining academic performance as indicated by their decreasing GPAs across recent semesters. While they engage in exercise more frequently than the average student, particularly exercising alone or participating in sports (Z-scores 1.07 and 0.91 respectively), this does not appear to fully mitigate other indicators of distress. Their alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-scores 1.01 and 0.94) is slightly above the population average, though these habits show negligible correlation with CES-D in this dataset. A more notable pattern is a marked reduction in engagement with various recreational activities, including significantly less internet usage (Z-Score -1.16), listening to music (Z-Score -1.19), and especially socializing with friends (16-30 minutes, Z-Score -1.41), compared to the study population. This low engagement in social and recreational activities, particularly socializing, suggests potential social withdrawal or reduced interest.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological data reveals both average circadian regularity and indicators of elevated physiological arousal. The participant's Interdaily Stability (Z-Score 0.25) and Intradaily Variability (Z-Score 0.1) are close to the population mean, suggesting a relatively stable and structured daily heart rate rhythm, with the acrophase occurring in the late afternoon at 3:51 PM. However, the participant's mean heart rate (Mesor 78.01, Z-Score 0.56) and resting heart rate (63.8, Z-Score 0.67) are both elevated above the study population average. These elevated baseline heart rate metrics, which show a weak positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.19), can be indicative of heightened physiological stress or anxiety.

The disaggregated hourly heart rate data further supports a pattern of sustained physiological activity. Specific hours in the late morning (10-11 AM, Z-Score 1.06) and throughout the afternoon (3-4 PM, Z-Score 0.72; 4-5 PM, Z-Score 0.67) show significantly elevated heart rate deviations from the mesor compared to the study population. This suggests periods of higher cardiovascular activity and potential arousal extending through the academic day and early evening. Despite these physiological indicators of arousal, objective sleep data from the wearable shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours 47 minutes (Z-Score 0.74), which is above the population average, and relatively stable sleep duration and start times. This contrasts notably with the participant's self-reported ""disturbed sleep"" as measured by the PSQI, highlighting a significant discrepancy between objective sleep quantity/regularity and subjective sleep quality, a common presentation in individuals experiencing psychological distress.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The participant exhibits multiple strong indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms. Their STAI-Trait score (Z-score 2.05) reflects significantly high anxiety, which holds a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.81). Similarly, their notably low self-esteem (Z-Score -1.57) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71), implying higher depressive symptoms. Low self-reported happiness (Z-Score -1.61, r=-0.46) and moderately elevated perceived stress (Z-Score 0.65, r=0.28) further align with this pattern. The self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score 9.0, Z-Score 1.05) is a key symptom of distress. Behaviorally, significantly reduced socializing with friends (Z-Score -1.41) and less engagement in recreational internet usage and music listening (Z-scores -1.16, -1.19), which positively correlate with CES-D, suggest social withdrawal and anhedonia. Physiologically, elevated resting heart rate (Z-Score 0.67) and mean heart rate (Mesor Z-Score 0.56) indicate heightened physiological arousal, with several hourly heart rate deviations showing significantly elevated activity compared to peers (e.g., 10-11 AM, Z-Score 1.06). A declining GPA trend across semesters might also reflect underlying psychological challenges.

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Conversely, some data points suggest potentially mitigating factors or average well-being in specific domains. The participant reports higher-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-Score 1.79), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.42). Health satisfaction is near the population average (Z-score 0.22). Objectively, Fitbit data shows above-average sleep duration (7h 47m, Z-Score 0.74) and relatively stable sleep duration and start times. Furthermore, the participant reports higher engagement in exercise, both alone and in sports, which can be a protective factor against depression. Circadian rhythm metrics like Interdaily Stability and Intradaily Variability are close to the population mean, suggesting a relatively structured physiological rhythm.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite some mitigating factors, the preponderance and magnitude of evidence strongly indicate a higher depressive symptom burden. The robust and consistent findings from self-reported psychological measures (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, perceived stress, subjective sleep quality) are highly correlated with CES-D and individually suggest significant distress. The observed reduction in social and recreational engagement further supports this, pointing to core depressive symptoms like anhedonia and social withdrawal. While objective sleep duration and regularity are adequate, the participant's subjective experience of disturbed sleep is a critical discrepancy often seen in depressive states. The elevated physiological arousal, as indicated by higher resting heart rate and sustained hourly heart rate deviations, provides a biological correlate to the psychological distress. The few indicators pointing towards a lower CES-D, such as higher trust and objective sleep quantity, are outweighed by the numerous and potent markers of distress. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

31175,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological state presents a complex picture. While trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is near the population mean (Z-score = -0.13), the participant is classified as 'anxious', and this measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.81). Similarly, perceived stress is notably higher than average (Z-score = 0.65), correlating positively with CES-D (r = 0.28). Concurrently, current happiness is below the population average (Z-score = -0.53), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.46). Conversely, self-esteem is above average (Z-score = 0.4), bearing a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), and health satisfaction is also higher than average (Z-score = 0.63), with a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.39). These findings suggest an individual experiencing elevated stress and reduced happiness, alongside a predisposition towards anxiety, despite possessing relatively high self-esteem and satisfaction with their physical health.

Behavioral habits indicate a physically active lifestyle balanced with significant screen time and social engagement. The participant reports exercising alone and participating in sports three times a week or more (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.58, respectively), though they do not engage in exercise with others (Z-score = -1.58). Socializing with friends is frequent, averaging 3-4 hours daily (Z-score = 1.74). However, there is also notable engagement in screen-based activities such as watching TV/videos/movies (1-2 hours, Z-score = 1.28) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score = 1.13), alongside 2-3 hours of internet usage (Z-score = 0.85). Internet usage and listening to music show moderate positive correlations with CES-D (r = 0.25 for both), while exercising with others has a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.23). Alcohol consumption is at a moderate level, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. This pattern suggests an active, socially connected individual who also allocates substantial time to screen-based leisure, some aspects of which show a positive association with depressive symptoms.

Sleep patterns reveal significant disturbances despite extended sleep durations. The participant’s median sleep duration of 9 hours and 34 minutes is substantially longer than the population average (Z-score = 2.96). However, this long duration is accompanied by extremely high variability in sleep duration (standard deviation of 249 minutes, Z-score = 3.37), indicating inconsistent sleep structure. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score = 0.59) further classifies their subjective sleep as 'Disturbed Sleep'. Median sleep start time is consistent with peers, and variability in start time is average (Z-score = 0.03). This combination of prolonged, yet highly variable and subjectively poor sleep suggests a potentially dysregulated sleep-wake cycle, which is often associated with mood disturbances.

Physiological activity and circadian rhythm data, derived from wearable devices, show distinct characteristics. The participant exhibits significantly lower Intradaily Variability (Z-score = -1.73), suggesting a less fragmented and potentially more stable heart rate pattern throughout the day, or reduced physiological responsiveness to daily stimuli. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is lower than average (Z-score = -1.28), and the amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is also lower (Z-score = -0.81), indicating a less pronounced daily swing in cardiovascular activity. Hourly aggregated heart rate data indicates that while the overall diurnal pattern is typical, the participant's heart rate does not dip as profoundly as peers during early morning hours (3-7 AM) relative to their daily average (Mesor), with positive Z-scores for negative deviations during these hours (e.g., Z=0.97 at 4-5 AM), implying a relatively elevated heart rate during the latter part of the sleep period. The resting heart rate is near the population average (Z-score = -0.04). These physiological markers suggest a generally lower, less dynamic cardiovascular rhythm with potentially less restorative nocturnal heart rate recovery during specific sleep windows.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):
The participant exhibits higher-than-average self-esteem (Z-score = 0.4) which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71). Similarly, higher health satisfaction (Z-score = 0.63) is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.39). Engagement in solitary exercise and sports is frequent (Z-scores > 1.0), and these activities have weak negative correlations with CES-D. The high frequency of socializing with friends (Z-score = 1.74) could also be a protective factor, though its direct correlation with CES-D is very weak (r = -0.01).

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50%):
Several factors point towards a higher depressive symptom burden. The participant is classified as 'anxious' on the STAI, a measure with a very strong positive correlation to CES-D (r = 0.81), suggesting that their level of anxiety is highly associated with depressive symptoms. Current happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46), indicating reduced well-being. Perceived stress is notably higher than average (Z-score = 0.65) and positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.28). Furthermore, self-reported sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI score of 8.0, Z-score = 0.59), and objective sleep data shows extremely high variability in sleep duration (Z-score = 3.37), despite prolonged median sleep. These sleep disturbances are common symptoms associated with depression. Physiologically, the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is lower than average (Z-score = -1.28) and shows a positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.19), implying that lower general physiological activity is associated with higher depressive symptoms. The reduced heart rate dip during early morning hours, as indicated by hourly heart rate data, may also suggest less restorative sleep. Behavioral patterns such as higher internet usage and listening to music are moderately positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.25 for both), and the absence of exercising with others is moderately negatively correlated (r = -0.23), indicating potential behavioral patterns associated with elevated symptoms.

Holistic Analysis:
While the participant exhibits protective factors such as high self-esteem and health satisfaction, the weight of evidence from other domains strongly suggests an elevated depressive symptom burden. The conjunction of being classified as 'anxious' with a very strong anxiety-CES-D correlation, lower happiness, higher perceived stress, and significant, objectively measured sleep disturbances (poor quality, extreme variability, and potentially less restorative heart rate patterns during sleep) are highly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology. These factors, alongside lower overall physiological activity (Mesor) and certain recreational habits (internet/music use, lack of group exercise) that correlate positively with CES-D, outweigh the protective aspects.

The participant's psychological profile reveals a complex interplay of strengths and vulnerabilities. Self-reported data indicates above-average trait anxiety (Z-score = 0.46) and below-average self-esteem (Z-score = -0.73), both of which are strongly correlated with higher depressive symptom burden in the study population. Additionally, current self-reported happiness is below the population average (Z-score = -0.53), also correlating with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant reports lower perceived stress (Z-score = -0.44), above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = 0.83), and notably high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score = 1.3). These latter factors are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms, creating a nuanced subjective experience. Academic performance is consistently strong, with GPAs in the 3.7-3.8 range.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active and socially engaged lifestyle. They report exercising frequently, both alone and with others (Z-scores of 1.07 and 1.23 respectively), and regularly participate in sports (Z-score = 0.91). These high levels of physical activity are negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Social engagement is exceptionally high, with significant time spent socializing with friends (Z-score = 1.74). In contrast, engagement in sedentary recreational activities such as watching TV, playing video games, listening to music, reading, and other sedentary hobbies is markedly low or non-existent, with multiple activities reported as ""do not do"" (Z-scores below -1.0 for TV/videos/movies and listening to music). Substance use includes above-average consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94) but minimal use of other substances.

Sleep patterns are characterized by remarkably long durations and good self-reported quality. The median sleep duration is 9 hours and 2 minutes, placing the participant significantly above the population average (Z-score = 2.3). Self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is favorable (Score 5.0, Z-score = -0.8), indicating better-than-average sleep. Furthermore, sleep duration exhibits notable consistency (Z-score = -0.15), and the participant rarely naps (Z-score = -0.02), both weakly correlated with lower depressive symptoms. Sleep start time variability is within the average range (Z-score = 0.46).

Physiological data derived from wearable sensors indicate a well-structured heart rate-based circadian rhythm with strong 24-hour periodicity (Autocorrelation Z-score = 1.06) and a robust amplitude (Z-score = 1.0). The average heart rate (Mesor) is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.77), while resting heart rate is average (Z-score = 0.07). Analysis of hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. The participant exhibits profoundly low heart rates during typical sleep hours, indicative of appropriate rest. However, during waking hours, there are periods of exceptionally high physiological arousal, most notably a peak in the morning (8-9 AM, Z-score = 3.52) and significant elevations in the afternoon (2-3 PM, Z-score = 2.03; 4-5 PM, Z-score = 2.0). These represent substantial and sustained periods of cardiovascular activity, considerably exceeding population averages for those times, which may reflect heightened physiological activation or stress reactivity despite self-reported low perceived stress.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant demonstrates several robust behavioral and lifestyle factors typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. These include a very high frequency of exercise, both alone and with others, which shows strong negative correlations with CES-D scores. Social engagement is also exceptionally high, which is generally protective. Objectively, sleep duration is considerably longer than the population average and self-reported sleep quality is good. The circadian rhythm exhibits strong regularity and amplitude. Subjectively, the participant reports below-average perceived stress, above-average interpersonal trust, and very high satisfaction with their physical health, all of which are correlated with lower CES-D scores. Consistent high academic performance also suggests a degree of adaptive functioning.

**Evidence for High CES-D (Top 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, the participant exhibits significant psychological vulnerabilities strongly linked to elevated depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is above average and carries a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.82). Self-esteem is notably below average, and its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71) indicates a predisposition to higher depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is also below average, further aligning with an elevated CES-D score. Physiologically, the pronounced and sustained peaks in heart rate deviation during waking hours, particularly the extreme morning arousal (Z-score = 3.52), suggest periods of significant physiological activation that may indicate underlying tension, stress, or anxiety. While not directly correlated with CES-D in the provided data, such physiological patterns can co-occur with depressive symptoms, especially in individuals with elevated trait anxiety.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a compelling dichotomy. While numerous positive behavioral and lifestyle factors (e.g., high exercise, good sleep quantity, strong social engagement) typically mitigate depressive symptoms, the core self-reported psychological traits strongly suggest a higher burden. The elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and reduced happiness are central psychological vulnerabilities that are highly correlated with CES-D scores in this study population. These factors represent more fundamental aspects of psychological well-being compared to the behavioral coping mechanisms. The observed pattern of significant physiological arousal, particularly the pronounced morning heart rate peak, further suggests an underlying physiological activation or stress response that aligns more with the subjective psychological distress indicated by the anxiety, self-esteem, and happiness measures, rather than the self-reported low perceived stress. Despite being highly functional in their daily activities and academic pursuits, these core psychological vulnerabilities, combined with physiological arousal, lead to the conclusion that the participant is likely experiencing a relatively higher burden of depressive symptoms.

96689,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a mixed psychological and behavioral profile, showing areas of both vulnerability and resilience concerning depressive symptoms. Psychologically, there is evidence of elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 47.0, Z-score 0.56, classified as anxious), which is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.82). Concurrently, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), suggesting lower overall mood. Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is notably low (Z-score -1.61) and also negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.4). Conversely, the participant demonstrates relatively good self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), a factor strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (-0.71), and reports below-average perceived stress (Z-score -0.44) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.18), both of which are protective factors.

Sleep patterns reveal a consistent schedule but subjective disturbance. The participant reports disturbed sleep according to the PSQI (score 6.0), indicating potential difficulties, even though this score is slightly better than the population average (Z-score -0.33). Objective Fitbit data, however, indicates a highly consistent sleep routine, with adequate median sleep duration (7 hours 18 minutes, Z-score 0.14) and notably low variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -1.42) and sleep start time (Z-score -1.19). The median sleep start time is late, at 01:55 AM, and the participant reports no napping. The low variability in sleep parameters suggests a stable behavioral routine despite the subjective report of disturbance.

Physiologically, the participant exhibits a remarkably stable and robust heart rate-based circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (Z-score 0.75) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.98) are both high, indicating consistent day-to-day patterns in cardiovascular activity. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also pronounced (Z-score 1.36), suggesting a clear distinction between peak and trough heart rate periods. Hourly heart rate data further supports this, showing significant drops below the mesor (mean heart rate) during nocturnal hours, indicative of physiological rest, and distinct peaks during daytime and early evening, demonstrating a well-structured and responsive cardiovascular system. The mesor itself is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.52) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), while resting heart rate is average (Z-score 0.08). Despite a slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z-score 0.74), the overall picture is one of strong physiological regularity and resilience.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a profile of no substance usage, which is a positive health indicator. However, a significant behavioral concern is the complete absence of reported exercise across all categories (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score -1.93; Exercised with Others Z-score -1.58). Lack of exercise, particularly exercising with others, is negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.23), implying that a lack of physical activity is associated with higher depressive symptoms. In terms of daily recreation, the participant demonstrates high social engagement (socializing with friends for 2-3 hours, Z-score 0.95), which is generally a protective factor for mental well-being, while engaging minimally in passive activities like watching TV or video games.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The participant presents a complex profile with strong indicators for both elevated and relatively low depressive symptomatology.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
*   **Elevated Trait Anxiety (STAI):** The participant's STAI score is classified as anxious and shows a very strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D, suggesting a significant predisposition to distress associated with depressive symptoms.
*   **Low Self-Reported Happiness:** Happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), indicating that this lower happiness is linked to higher depressive burden.
*   **Very Low Health Satisfaction:** Self-reported health satisfaction is notably poor (Z-score -1.61) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.4).
*   **Absence of Exercise:** The complete lack of engagement in exercise across all categories is a major behavioral risk factor. Lack of social exercise, in particular, is associated with higher CES-D scores.
*   **Subjective Sleep Disturbance:** A PSQI score of 6.0 indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, a common symptom of depression.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
*   **Strong Self-Esteem:** The participant exhibits relatively high self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), which is a powerful protective factor, strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71).
*   **Low Perceived Stress:** Perceived stress is below average (Z-score -0.44), suggesting good stress coping, and is weakly correlated with CES-D (0.28).
*   **High Interpersonal Trust:** Above-average trust (Z-score 0.18) is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41), serving as another protective factor.
*   **Absence of Substance Use:** The participant reports no substance use, indicating a low-risk lifestyle.
*   **High Social Engagement:** Active socializing (Z-score 0.95) contributes positively to well-being.
*   **Highly Stable Physiological Circadian Rhythm and Sleep:** Wearable data shows exceptional regularity in heart rate rhythms (high interdaily stability, 24-hour autocorrelation, robust amplitude) and highly consistent sleep patterns (low standard deviation for duration and start time), suggesting strong physiological resilience and routine.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant benefits from robust physiological stability, good self-esteem, low perceived stress, and strong social engagement, the presence of significant subjective distress (elevated anxiety, low happiness, very low health satisfaction, and disturbed sleep) combined with the complete absence of a key health-promoting behavior like exercise strongly points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The strong correlations of anxiety, happiness, and health satisfaction with CES-D, alongside the lack of exercise, suggest that these factors would significantly contribute to a higher CES-D score. The protective factors are substantial, but the magnitude of the self-reported psychological vulnerabilities and the behavioral deficit in exercise are likely to outweigh them, pushing the participant's overall CES-D score into the upper half of the population distribution.

33657,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile generally indicates a favorable mental well-being when compared to the study population. Specifically, scores on the STAI-Trait scale, assessing chronic anxiety, are below the population mean (Z-score -0.43), classifying the participant as 'not anxious'. Correspondingly, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is above average (Z-score 0.4), as is self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5). Perceived stress is also lower than the population mean (Z-score -0.44), and overall satisfaction with physical health is slightly elevated (Z-score 0.22). The observed correlations between these measures and CES-D scores (e.g., strong positive correlation for STAI, strong negative correlation for self-esteem, happiness, trust, and health satisfaction, and a weak positive correlation for stress) consistently suggest a lower depressive symptom burden for this participant based on their reported psychological traits.

Sleep patterns present a more complex picture. While the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 indicates disturbed sleep by clinical standards, the participant's PSQI Z-score of -0.33 suggests that their sleep quality is marginally better than the average for this specific study population. Furthermore, Fitbit-derived sleep statistics reveal a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 5 minutes, which is only slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.13). The participant exhibits lower variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.85) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.42), indicating a relatively consistent sleep schedule. However, a notable observation is a significantly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 2.23), which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D scores, potentially pointing towards daytime fatigue. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data further suggest some degree of disruption: the participant shows slightly lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.49) and higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.74), suggesting less regular and more fragmented daily activity patterns. The heart rate rhythm also exhibits a significantly dampened amplitude (Z-score -1.18), which is a physiological feature often associated with depressive states. Despite these indicators, the participant's resting heart rate (Z-score -0.83) and mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.46) are considerably lower than the population average, generally indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, and correlate positively with CES-D, implying lower values are associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Regarding daily activity and physiological arousal, the aggregated hourly heart rate data reveals a distinct daily profile. The participant demonstrates a highly elevated physiological arousal in the late morning, particularly between 10-11 AM, indicated by a heart rate deviation from mesor with a Z-score of 2.71. This is followed by periods of noticeably lower physiological activity compared to the population, specifically in the early afternoon (1-2 PM, Z-score -1.22), and a significantly pronounced decrease in arousal during the early evening (7-8 PM, Z-score -2.26; 8-9 PM, Z-score -1.26; 9-10 PM, Z-score -1.37). This pattern could suggest a strong burst of morning energy followed by distinct lulls or an early wind-down phase. Behavioral habits indicate high engagement in certain sedentary activities; the participant reports spending more than 4 hours in sedentary hobbies, yielding an exceptionally high Z-score of 3.19. This behavior, along with higher internet usage (Z-score 0.85) and slightly higher music listening (Z-score 0.21), exhibits weak positive correlations with CES-D scores. Conversely, the participant reports lower engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score -1.25) and reading (Z-score -0.67). Exercise habits are mixed, with slightly above-average frequency for exercising alone and below-average for exercising with others or participating in sports.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The predominant evidence strongly suggests that this participant's depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would likely fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution. The self-reported psychological measures consistently indicate better mental well-being than the average student. Specifically, the participant exhibits significantly lower anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.43, positively correlated with CES-D), higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.4, negatively correlated with CES-D), higher happiness (Z-score 0.55, negatively correlated with CES-D), higher trust (Z-score 0.5, negatively correlated with CES-D), lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.44, positively correlated with CES-D), and higher health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22, negatively correlated with CES-D). The correlations for these measures with CES-D are generally strong to moderate, indicating a robust association with lower depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, physiological indicators such as a significantly lower mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.46) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.83), both of which correlate positively with CES-D, support a lower CES-D score. Aspects of sleep regularity, specifically lower variability in sleep duration and start time, are also associated with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Despite the strong indicators for lower depressive symptoms, several metrics suggest areas of potential vulnerability or elevated symptoms, which might lean towards a higher CES-D score. The participant's PSQI score of 6.0 indicates subjectively disturbed sleep, even if it is slightly less disturbed than the population mean. A particularly salient point is the significantly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 2.23), which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D, implying increased napping is linked to higher depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm analysis also reveals a significantly dampened amplitude in heart rate fluctuations (Z-score -1.18), a physiological marker frequently associated with depression. Additionally, the participant demonstrates higher intradaily variability (Z-score 0.74) and lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.49), indicating more fragmented and less regular activity patterns, which can be seen in mood disorders. Behaviorally, the participant reports an extremely high engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z-score 3.19), a habit that, despite a weak correlation, could contribute to a higher CES-D burden due to its sheer magnitude and potential link to reduced physical activity and social engagement. High internet usage (Z-score 0.85) also shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When synthesizing the multimodal data, the extensive and consistently positive self-reported psychological profile of the participant presents compelling evidence for a lower depressive symptom burden. The strength and direction of the correlations for these direct psychological measures are particularly noteworthy and carry substantial weight in predicting CES-D scores. While there are concerning elements in the sleep and activity data, such as increased napping, dampened circadian amplitude, and extremely high sedentary hobby engagement, the correlations for these specific indicators with CES-D are generally weaker. The PSQI score, while clinically indicative of disturbed sleep, is still better than the population average. Therefore, the robust and convergent evidence from the self-report measures of mental well-being, which directly assess constructs closely related to depression, is more influential than the more indirect or weakly correlated behavioral and physiological markers. The participant's overall profile strongly suggests a lower manifestation of depressive symptoms compared to their peers.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
36117,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"The participant presents a mixed profile of psychological, behavioral, and physiological data. Subjective self-reports indicate generally robust psychological well-being. The participant scored in the ""not anxious"" range on the STAI-Trait scale, with a Z-score of -0.33, suggesting lower anxiety proneness compared to the study population. This aligns with a strong positive correlation between STAI scores and CES-D (0.81), indicating that lower anxiety is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, self-esteem, as measured by the RSES, is notably high (Score 45.0, Z-score 0.96), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Self-reported happiness is also significantly elevated (Score 5.0, Z-score 1.64), another factor negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46). The participant reports above-average interpersonal trust (Score 4.17, Z-score 1.79), a trait also negatively associated with CES-D (-0.41). Perceived stress levels are slightly below the population average (PSS Score 21.0, Z-score -0.17), with a positive correlation to CES-D (0.28), further supporting a lower depressive symptom burden from a subjective psychological standpoint. However, health satisfaction is reported as below average (Z-score -0.62), which, given its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.39), suggests a potential contributor to higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral habits reveal a highly social individual with notable sedentary patterns. The participant engages in exercise with others frequently (""Three times a week or more,"" Z-score 1.23), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23). Socializing with friends is also exceptionally high (""more than 4 hours,"" Z-score 2.53), although its correlation with CES-D is negligible (-0.02). Conversely, engagement in exercising alone (Z-score -1.93) and sports (Z-score -1.09) is very low, suggesting a less diverse physical activity profile. Significant sedentary habits are evident, with very high internet usage (""more than 4 hours,"" Z-score 2.19) and extensive time spent on a ""Sedentary Hobby"" (""more than 4 hours,"" Z-score 3.19). Both internet usage (correlation 0.25) and sedentary hobbies (correlation 0.12) are positively correlated with CES-D, indicating these behaviors could contribute to increased depressive symptoms. Watching TV/Videos/Movies is also above average (Z-score 1.28) and positively correlated with CES-D (0.13). Substance use is generally low or moderate.

Sleep patterns present a key area of concern. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 8.0 (Z-score 0.59) indicates disturbed sleep quality. While median sleep duration from Fitbit data is slightly above average at 7 hours 39 minutes (Z-score 0.58), the variability in sleep start time is slightly elevated (Standard Deviation 100 minutes, Z-score 0.37) and positively correlated with CES-D (0.22), suggesting less consistent sleep initiation. Conversely, sleep duration standard deviation is slightly below average (Z-score -0.18), indicating more consistent sleep duration. The participant rarely naps (Mean Daily Naps 0.0, Z-score -0.86), which, given its positive correlation with CES-D (0.21), is associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Physiological data derived from wearable technology highlight elevated cardiovascular arousal and structured, albeit elevated, circadian rhythms. The participant exhibits a significantly elevated Mesor heart rate (Value 88.9, Z-score 2.04) and Resting Heart Rate (Value 72.0, Z-score 1.65). Both Mesor and Resting Heart Rate are positively correlated with CES-D (0.19), suggesting a physiological state associated with higher depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate good interdaily stability (Z-score 1.16) and a robust amplitude (Z-score 1.58), which are generally positive indicators of circadian health. Intradaily variability is notably low (Z-score -1.94), indicating a highly consistent daily heart rate pattern, which could reflect either stable physiological function or a lack of dynamic activity. The acrophase, or peak physiological activity, occurs in the late afternoon (5:06 PM), which is a common pattern. Hourly deviations from the mesor show a typical diurnal pattern, with heart rate decreasing during nighttime hours to significantly below the mesor (e.g., -23.84 at 5-6 AM) and rising during the day, peaking in the evening (e.g., 16.98 at 7-8 PM). These deviations, however, are relative to an already elevated mesor.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a relatively low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial, primarily stemming from the participant's strong self-reported psychological well-being. The participant reports low anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33, correlation 0.81), high self-esteem (Z-score 0.96, correlation -0.71), elevated happiness (Z-score 1.64, correlation -0.46), and high trust (Z-score 1.79, correlation -0.41). All these factors are strongly correlated with lower CES-D scores and the participant's values are in the beneficial direction. Additionally, lower-than-average perceived stress (Z-score -0.17, correlation 0.28) and high frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 1.23, correlation -0.23) contribute to this evidence. High social engagement (Z-score 2.53) also generally serves as a protective factor, despite a negligible correlation with CES-D.

Conversely, evidence for a relatively high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is also present, mainly through physiological and behavioral measures. The participant's disturbed sleep quality (PSQI score 8.0, Z-score 0.59) and below-average health satisfaction (Z-score -0.62, correlation -0.39) point to potential challenges. Furthermore, extremely high internet usage (Z-score 2.19, correlation 0.25) and time spent on a sedentary hobby (Z-score 3.19, correlation 0.12) represent significant behavioral patterns associated with higher CES-D. Most notably, the participant exhibits significantly elevated Mesor Heart Rate (Z-score 2.04, correlation 0.19) and Resting Heart Rate (Z-score 1.65, correlation 0.19), physiological markers often indicative of chronic stress or dysregulation that can accompany depressive symptoms. Slightly higher variability in sleep start time (Z-score 0.37, correlation 0.22) also suggests a potential contribution to higher CES-D.

Holistically, the strong self-reported psychological protective factors (low anxiety, high self-esteem, happiness, trust, and relatively low stress) have substantially stronger correlations with CES-D than the concerning physiological and behavioral metrics. While the elevated heart rate, disturbed sleep, and sedentary lifestyle are significant and suggest underlying physiological and behavioral health challenges, their direct association with the self-reported CES-D symptoms is less pronounced when considering the strength of correlations. Given that the CES-D is a self-report measure reflecting an individual's subjective experience of depressive symptoms, the participant's overwhelmingly positive self-perception across core psychological domains is likely to heavily influence their overall score, placing it below the population median. The presence of objective physiological and behavioral challenges suggests areas for intervention or monitoring, but these may not directly translate to a high *self-reported* depressive symptom burden, especially when contrasted with strong psychological resilience.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
92515,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a generally positive psychological disposition and robust academic performance, alongside significant and chronic sleep disturbances. Self-report measures indicate a low level of trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.52) and low perceived stress (PSS Z-score: -0.71), both of which are associated with lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 0.4) and notably high current happiness (Z-score: 1.64), both of which are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores. High interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83) also aligns with a lower depressive symptom burden. Academically, the participant maintains a consistent 4.0 GPA across multiple semesters, suggesting strong coping and organizational skills. Health satisfaction, however, is reported as slightly below average (Z-score: -0.78), a factor associated with higher CES-D scores.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains an active lifestyle, engaging in sports and exercising with others 1-2 times a week, which are both protective behaviors against depressive symptoms. Substance use includes wine or liquor 1-2 times a week (Z-score: 0.94), which is above the population average, while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreation habits show a relatively high engagement in watching TV/videos/movies and reading, but below-average time spent socializing with friends (Z-score: -0.62) and low internet usage. The reduced social interaction could be a subtle indicator, but it is counterbalanced by engagement in group exercise and sports.

Physiological data, particularly sleep and circadian rhythms, reveal significant patterns. The participant's median sleep duration is notably short at 5 hours 55 minutes, corresponding to a Z-score of -1.58, indicating severe sleep deprivation relative to the study population. This is further compounded by a very late median sleep start time of 02:57 AM and a higher-than-average variability in sleep start times (Z-score: 0.59). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 confirms disturbed sleep, despite a slightly negative Z-score in the population, suggesting that while the participant's sleep is disturbed, other students may experience even greater disturbances. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show generally stable patterns with slightly above-average interdaily stability (Z-score: 0.09) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: 0.73), alongside slightly below-average intradaily variability (Z-score: -0.11), suggesting a structured, albeit potentially later, daily rhythm. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed relatively late in the day at 4:43 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor highlight pronounced physiological activity peaks during the early afternoon (e.g., 12-1 PM, 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM with Z-scores of 1.46, 0.92, 1.19 respectively), following a prolonged period of lower activity extending into the late morning. This pattern is consistent with a delayed chronotype and high mid-day engagement, even with the presence of overall sleep deprivation. The participant's resting heart rate is low (56.0 bpm, Z-score: -0.26), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The strongest evidence for a low or median CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -0.52; Score Correlation: 0.81), high self-esteem (Z-score: 0.4; Score Correlation: -0.71), exceptionally high current happiness (Z-score: 1.64; Score Correlation: -0.46), low perceived stress (Z-score: -0.71; Score Correlation: 0.28), and high interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83; Score Correlation: -0.41). All these measures are significantly correlated with CES-D scores in directions indicating a lower depressive symptom burden, with several correlations being quite strong. Furthermore, consistent high academic performance (4.0 GPA) and an active lifestyle with regular sports and group exercise are generally considered protective factors against depression. Circadian rhythm stability also falls within typical ranges, suggesting a degree of physiological regulation.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for a potentially higher CES-D score stems from the severe and chronic sleep disturbance. The participant experiences an extremely short median sleep duration (5 hours 55 minutes; Z-score: -1.58) and highly variable, late sleep start times (median 02:57 AM; sleep start time standard deviation Z-score: 0.59). The PSQI score of 6.0 formally classifies sleep as disturbed. Lower self-reported health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.78; Score Correlation: -0.4) and below-average socializing with friends (Z-score: -0.62) also contribute to this evidence, as they are negatively correlated with CES-D scores (i.e., lower satisfaction/socializing associated with higher CES-D). The above-average wine/liquor consumption (Z-score: 0.94) could also be a subtle indicator, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits severe sleep deprivation and disturbed sleep patterns, which are significant risk factors and symptoms of depression, the overall psychological profile is overwhelmingly positive. The robust scores in self-esteem, happiness, low anxiety, and low stress are strong indicators of psychological well-being, with correlations that suggest a substantial protective effect against depressive symptoms. The negligible correlation between median sleep duration and CES-D score in this specific dataset (Score Correlation: -0.01) suggests that while short sleep is a serious health concern for this individual, it does not, in isolation, strongly predict elevated CES-D within this study population. The consistency and magnitude of the positive psychological indicators, coupled with high academic achievement and an active lifestyle, strongly suggest that despite the sleep challenges, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden is likely on the lower side. The sleep disturbance may be attributable to other factors common in university populations, such as academic pressures or lifestyle choices, rather than necessarily indicating elevated depressive symptomatology, especially in the context of otherwise positive mental health indicators.

{""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
49790,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents a mixed but generally resilient picture. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is notably low (Z-score = -1.41, indicating significantly less anxiety than the population average), and self-esteem is reported as high (Z-score = 1.1), both of which are strongly inversely correlated with CES-D scores. Similarly, satisfaction with physical health is high (Z-score = 1.22), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D. These factors generally suggest a protective psychological landscape against depressive symptoms. However, aspects of the participant's current mental state appear less optimal; self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53) and perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.38), both moderately to weakly correlated with CES-D. Additionally, the PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score = 0.13) classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep, a common feature in mood dysregulation. The participant also reports high levels of interpersonal trust (Z-score = 1.47), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant demonstrates a moderate engagement in health-related activities, with exercise frequency reported as slightly above the population average for both solitary and social forms. Substance use is characterized by above-average consumption of wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is low. Engagement in daily recreational activities shows a mixed pattern; while watching TV/videos/movies is above average (Z-score = 0.64), activities like internet usage, listening to music, socializing with friends, and reading are reported as below average. These leisure patterns, particularly reduced social engagement and intellectual pursuits, could indirectly influence mood, though direct correlations with CES-D are generally weak for these specific behaviors. Academic performance, as indicated by consistently high GPAs, suggests a maintained level of academic functioning.

Wearable data reveal notable patterns in the participant's physiological rhythms. The circadian rhythm exhibits low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.32) and very low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score = -1.54), indicating significant day-to-day irregularity in physiological patterns. Concurrently, the circadian amplitude is low (Z-score = -0.97), suggesting a blunted or less robust daily variation in heart rate. Further, the participant displays an elevated physiological arousal state, evidenced by a high MESOR (Z-score = 2.03) and a significantly high resting heart rate (Z-score = 2.09), both of which are weakly positively correlated with CES-D. These findings collectively suggest a dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and compromised circadian rhythmicity, which are frequently observed in conditions associated with elevated stress and mood disturbances. The acrophase is noted at 6:15 PM, indicating the peak of the average daily heart rate rhythm.

Sleep patterns, as captured by wearable devices, complement the self-reported sleep disturbance. While total sleep duration is above average at 8 hours and 4 minutes (Z-score = 1.1), the participant exhibits a notably late median sleep start time of 02:18:20 and exceptionally high variability in sleep onset (Standard Deviation = 169 minutes, Z-score = 1.89). This significant inconsistency in sleep timing directly contributes to the observed irregularities in physiological circadian rhythms, such as low interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation. The combination of adequate duration with highly irregular timing aligns with the PSQI classification of disturbed sleep, highlighting a key area of potential physiological and behavioral dysregulation. The participant does not typically take naps.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR further elucidates the participant’s physiological arousal patterns. During typical sleep hours (e.g., 1-7 AM), the heart rate deviations, while negative, show Z-scores that are often positive (e.g., 4-5 AM Z-score = 1.33), indicating that the participant's nocturnal heart rate is higher relative to the population's average decrease during these times. Conversely, during peak daytime activity hours (e.g., 1-2 PM Z-score = -1.13, 2-3 PM Z-score = -1.11, 4-5 PM Z-score = -0.97, 5-6 PM Z-score = -1.07), heart rate elevations are comparatively lower than the population average. This pattern suggests a blunted physiological response during active periods and a sustained, higher level of arousal during rest, contributing to a flattened daily heart rate profile and supporting the observations of high MESOR, high resting heart rate, and low circadian amplitude.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile, <= 11.5):**
The strongest evidence for a lower CES-D score comes from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. The STAI-Trait score is significantly low (Z-score = -1.41), indicating low trait anxiety, and exhibits a very strong positive correlation (0.81) with CES-D. This implies that lower trait anxiety is highly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Concurrently, the participant reports high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.1) on the RSES, which has a very strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, suggesting higher self-esteem is strongly linked to lower depressive symptoms. Furthermore, high interpersonal trust (Z-score = 1.47) and high health satisfaction (Z-score = 1.22) also show moderate negative correlations with CES-D, acting as additional protective factors. While not strongly correlated with CES-D, above-average exercise frequency and low recreational drug use are generally associated with better well-being.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile, > 11.5):**
Conversely, several indicators suggest potential for an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant's self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score = -0.53) and perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score = 0.38), with moderate (-0.46) and weak (0.28) correlations with CES-D, respectively, indicating some current distress. More significantly, the physiological and sleep data point to considerable dysregulation. The PSQI indicates disturbed sleep, which is a common symptom of depression. Wearable data reveal pronounced circadian rhythm disturbances, characterized by very high variability in sleep start time (Z-score = 1.89, weak positive correlation with CES-D = 0.23), low interdaily stability, and low circadian amplitude. Additionally, the participant exhibits signs of elevated physiological arousal, with a high MESOR (Z-score = 2.03) and a high resting heart rate (Z-score = 2.09), both weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.20). The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reinforce this, showing a blunted physiological response to daytime activity and sustained arousal during rest. Reduced engagement in social activities also contributes to this picture, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When balancing the available evidence, the strong self-reported psychological protective factors — notably very low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, which have the strongest correlations with CES-D in the dataset (0.81 and -0.71, respectively) — are highly compelling. These strong associations suggest a significant downward pull on the participant's CES-D score. While there is clear and concerning evidence of physiological dysregulation, disturbed sleep, and some reports of lower current happiness and higher stress, the correlations of these factors with CES-D are generally weaker or negligible compared to the correlations of trait anxiety and self-esteem. The observed physiological patterns, while indicative of stress and dysregulation, could potentially reflect a separate or comorbid challenge rather than necessarily driving the primary depressive symptom burden to the top half of the distribution when such robust psychological buffers are present. Therefore, considering the pronounced strength of the correlations for STAI and Self-Esteem, it is most probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable strengths in mental well-being traits alongside significant sleep disturbance and physiological dysregulation. Psychologically, the individual reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33) and above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), both of which are traits strongly associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is also notably low (Z-score -1.26). The participant is highly engaged in physical activity, exercising alone and with others three or more times a week (Z-scores 1.07 and 1.23, respectively), and reports above-average social engagement with friends. These active and social lifestyle components, coupled with a healthy Body Mass Index of 21.92 and no recreational drug use, generally suggest a robust and adaptive behavioral pattern that can be protective against mental health challenges. However, counterbalancing these strengths are self-reported lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53) and particularly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.53), a significant discrepancy given their active lifestyle and healthy BMI. Furthermore, the participant engages in above-average alcohol consumption (1-2 times a week for both beer and wine/liquor) and high levels of video game usage (Z-score 1.71) and music listening (Z-score 1.6).

A critical area of concern highlighted by both self-report and wearable data is sleep. The participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep, indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0 (Z-score 0.13). Objective Fitbit data corroborates this, revealing a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 30 minutes (Z-score -0.85). More strikingly, the participant exhibits an extremely late median sleep start time of 03:38:30, coupled with substantial variability in both sleep start times (standard deviation of 123 minutes, Z-score 0.88) and sleep duration (standard deviation of 117 minutes, Z-score 0.36). This pattern indicates a highly irregular and insufficient sleep schedule, likely contributing to overall functional impairment and potential distress.

Physiological data from wearable sensors further elucidates patterns of arousal and circadian rhythmicity. The participant's circadian rhythm shows signs of fragmentation and instability, with lower-than-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.82) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score -0.61), alongside higher-than-average Intradaily Variability (Z-score 0.88). These metrics suggest less regular and more fragmented physiological patterns throughout the day. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals an atypical daily profile. While the participant has a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) and mesor (Z-score -0.7), indicative of good cardiovascular fitness, their heart rate remains elevated even in the very early morning sleep hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score 1.58). Furthermore, there is a pronounced and sustained elevation in heart rate throughout the evening, peaking significantly around 7-8 PM (Z-score 1.53) and remaining positive until midnight. This sustained physiological arousal late into the evening, with an acrophase (peak activity time) at 6:50 PM, strongly aligns with the reported late and irregular sleep onset, suggesting difficulty in achieving physiological and psychological quiescence required for timely and consistent sleep initiation.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To assess the participant's likely CES-D score relative to the study population, we consider both indicators of elevated and lower depressive symptomatology, weighting by the strength of their correlation with the CES-D score.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
Strong evidence points towards a relatively lower CES-D score. The participant's STAI score, measuring trait anxiety, is low (Z-score -0.33), and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Similarly, the participant's self-esteem is above average (Z-Score 0.11), and self-esteem has a very strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). These two psychological traits are highly influential in predicting lower depressive symptom burden. Additionally, perceived stress is notably low (Z-Score -1.26), with a weak positive correlation (0.28), further supporting a lower CES-D. The participant engages in high levels of physical exercise and above-average social interaction, behaviors generally associated with improved mood and reduced depressive symptoms. Higher interpersonal trust (Z-Score 0.83) also correlates moderately negatively with CES-D (-0.41), suggesting a lower score. Their healthy BMI and no recreational drug use are also favorable indicators.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest a potentially higher CES-D score. The participant reports significantly disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7.0) and objectively experiences severely short (6.5 hours) and highly irregular sleep, with an extremely late and variable sleep start time. These sleep disturbances are common symptoms and risk factors for depression. Furthermore, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-Score -0.53) and very low satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score -1.53). These subjective well-being measures correlate moderately negatively with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively), implying an increased likelihood of higher depressive symptoms. The fragmented and less stable circadian rhythm, along with sustained physiological arousal in the evening hours, also indicates a state of dysregulation that can exacerbate mental health challenges.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When synthesizing the multimodal data, the most influential indicators are the self-reported psychological traits that exhibit the strongest correlations with CES-D. The participant's low trait anxiety (STAI) and high self-esteem are very strong protective factors against depressive symptoms, with correlation magnitudes of 0.81 and -0.71, respectively. While the severe sleep disturbance, lower happiness, and very low health satisfaction are concerning and contribute negatively to well-being, their associated correlations with CES-D are moderate (-0.46 and -0.39 for happiness and health satisfaction, respectively) or weak (e.g., sleep duration -0.0, sleep start time SD 0.22). The relative strength of the correlations for anxiety and self-esteem suggests that these factors would exert a more substantial downward pull on the CES-D score compared to the upward push from sleep problems and dissatisfaction with happiness and health. The participant also demonstrates robust behavioral engagement (exercise, socializing), which generally buffers against depressive states. Therefore, despite significant challenges related to sleep and subjective well-being, the participant's fundamental psychological trait profile likely places their overall depressive symptom burden in the lower half of the study population distribution.

48154,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant presents a robust psychological profile characterized by low anxiety and high self-esteem and happiness. Specifically, the STAI-Trait scale indicates the participant is ""not anxious"" (Z-score = -1.12), a finding that strongly correlates with lower depressive symptoms (correlation = 0.81). Self-esteem is notably high (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score = 50.0, Z-score = 1.66), which is strongly associated with lower CES-D scores (correlation = -0.71). Similarly, self-reported happiness is significantly above average (Z-score = 1.64) and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (correlation = -0.46). Perceived stress levels are average (PSS score = 21.0, Z-score = -0.17), while interpersonal trust is above average (Z-score = 0.83) and negatively correlated with CES-D (correlation = -0.41). Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score = 0.47) and inversely related to depressive symptoms (correlation = -0.39). Collectively, these self-report measures indicate a strong foundation of positive mental and emotional well-being that is generally protective against depressive symptomatology.

Sleep patterns, as assessed by both self-report and wearable data, appear to be exceptionally healthy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) classifies the participant as having ""Good Sleep"" (score = 5.0, Z-score = -0.8), suggesting high subjective sleep quality. Objectively, the median sleep duration is 8 hours and 3 minutes (Z-score = 1.08), indicating sufficient sleep. Furthermore, sleep duration consistency is high, with a below-average standard deviation of 64 minutes (Z-score = -0.85). The participant maintains a relatively consistent sleep start time (median 01:03:00) with below-average variability (standard deviation = 72 minutes, Z-score = -0.24). The absence of daily naps (Z-score = -0.86) further supports consolidated nighttime sleep. These objective sleep metrics, while having weak correlations with CES-D, generally reflect optimal sleep health.

Analysis of wearable-derived physiological data reveals a structured, albeit slightly less stable, circadian rhythm. The participant's interdaily stability (value = 0.26, Z-score = -1.23) is significantly below the population average, indicating less day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible (correlation = -0.01). Intradaily variability is average (Z-score = 0.1). The mean heart rate (Mesor = 68.26 bpm, Z-score = -0.78) and amplitude of the circadian rhythm (value = 8.57, Z-score = -0.71) are both slightly below average. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs at 5:29 PM, reflecting a typical late-afternoon activity peak. Resting heart rate is 56.0 bpm (Z-score = -0.26), which is slightly below average, consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show distinct physiological patterns: substantial negative deviations (up to -16.52 bpm, with positive Z-scores indicating more pronounced drops) are observed in the early morning hours (e.g., 3-7 AM), consistent with a deep and regular sleep period. Conversely, positive deviations peak in the late afternoon/early evening (e.g., 5-6 PM, 18.24 bpm deviation, Z-score = 1.13), aligning with the acrophase and reflecting typical daily activity.

In terms of lifestyle and academic engagement, the participant demonstrates consistent academic success, with GPAs ranging from 3.47 to 3.54 across academic semesters. Exercise habits are robust, with above-average engagement in exercising alone (three times a week or more, Z-score = 1.07) and sports (1-2 times a week, Z-score = 0.91). Engagement in exercise with others is below average (Z-score = -0.88), which has a weak negative correlation with CES-D (correlation = -0.23), suggesting lower social exercise is associated with higher CES-D. Substance use includes wine or liquor 1-2 times a week (Z-score = 0.94) and recreational drugs less than 1-2 times a month (Z-score = 1.61), with recreational drug use being above average in frequency relative to the study population, though its correlation with CES-D is weak (correlation = 0.16). Daily recreational habits include above-average internet usage (2-3 hours, Z-score = 0.85), which has a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (correlation = 0.26), but minimal engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. Overall, the participant maintains an active lifestyle and strong academic performance.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Analyzing the multimodal data, there is substantial evidence supporting a lower-than-average depressive symptom burden.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence stems from the participant's self-reported psychological well-being. A markedly low STAI score (Z-score = -1.12), indicating ""not anxious,"" is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (meaning lower anxiety predicts lower CES-D). This is coupled with significantly high self-esteem (Z-score = 1.66) and high self-reported happiness (Z-score = 1.64), both of which are strongly and negatively correlated with CES-D. Subjective and objective sleep metrics are also exemplary: ""Good Sleep"" on the PSQI (Z-score = -0.8), above-average sleep duration (Z-score = 1.08), and high consistency in sleep duration (Z-score = -0.85) and timing (Z-score = -0.24) all suggest a restorative sleep pattern generally associated with better mental health. The participant also reports above-average trust and health satisfaction, both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D. Consistent academic performance (high GPA) and regular engagement in exercise are also generally protective factors against depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence pointing towards an elevated CES-D score is considerably weaker. While the participant engages in above-average internet usage (Z-score = 0.85), which has a moderate positive correlation with CES-D (correlation = 0.26), and slightly elevated recreational drug use (Z-score = 1.61) with a weak positive correlation (correlation = 0.16), these are relatively minor indicators. Lower engagement in exercise with others (Z-score = -0.88) has a weak negative correlation with CES-D, meaning this factor might slightly increase CES-D, but its impact is limited. The significantly low interdaily stability (Z-score = -1.23) is an outlier in an otherwise consistent physiological profile, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible (correlation = -0.01), making it an unreliable indicator of depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant's profile is overwhelmingly characterized by positive psychological traits, excellent sleep hygiene, and robust academic and physical activity engagement. The strong negative correlations between the participant's high self-esteem, low anxiety, and high happiness scores with CES-D scores provide the most salient indicators. While some activity patterns like internet usage might weakly correlate with higher depressive symptoms in the population, their individual scores on these metrics are not extreme, and their potential influence is overshadowed by the powerful indicators of psychological well-being and health-promoting behaviors. Therefore, the combined evidence strongly supports a conclusion that the participant's depressive symptom burden is relatively low.

21793,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a notable pattern of psychological distress and behavioral dysregulation across self-reported measures and wearable-derived metrics. Psychologically, they report elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17) and significantly high perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 1.47), both of which are positively correlated with depressive symptoms. Concurrently, self-esteem (Z-score: -0.17), current happiness (Z-score: -0.53), and interpersonal trust (Z-score: -0.46) are all below the population average, and negatively correlated with CES-D, further suggesting a challenging internal state. Academic performance, as indicated by a declining GPA from 3.04 to 2.17 over three semesters, may reflect functional difficulties or increased cognitive burden. While health satisfaction is reported as slightly above average (Z-score: 0.3), this appears to be an outlier amidst a broader profile of distress.

Sleep patterns are highly indicative of significant disturbance, aligning with the participant's self-reported poor sleep quality (PSQI score: 9.0, Z-score: 1.05, classifying sleep as disturbed). Fitbit data corroborates this, revealing a median sleep duration of only 6 hours and 9 minutes (Z-score: -1.29), which is substantially shorter than the population average. Furthermore, the median sleep start time is exceptionally late at 03:36:45, coupled with a very high variability in sleep start times (standard deviation of 130 minutes, Z-score: 1.04). This irregularity is compounded by a remarkably high frequency of napping (mean daily naps: 0.33, Z-score: 3.05), suggesting an attempt to compensate for insufficient or fragmented nocturnal sleep. Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows elevated deviations from the mesor during typical deep sleep hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score: 1.54; 2-3 AM, Z-score: 2.07), indicating increased physiological arousal or activity during periods usually associated with rest.

Beyond specific sleep metrics, the participant's overall circadian rhythm, as derived from heart rate data, demonstrates significant disruption. Interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.98) is markedly low, while intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.95) is high, collectively pointing to highly irregular and fragmented daily activity and rest patterns. A reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -1.45) further suggests a lack of predictable daily routines. The circadian amplitude (Z-score: -1.38) is low, indicating a blunted, less robust physiological rhythm, and the acrophase occurs relatively late in the day at 6:32 PM. The resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score: -0.47), though its positive correlation with CES-D in this dataset suggests a lower RHR might be associated with a lower CES-D, which conflicts with other indicators of distress. Daily activity habits include higher-than-average time spent listening to music (Z-score: 1.6) and watching TV/videos (Z-score: 0.64), alongside reporting 'do not do' for reading (Z-score: -0.67), suggesting a preference for passive recreational activities. Substance use is generally moderate, and exercise frequency is moderate, which do not strongly contribute to a positive or negative interpretation regarding depressive symptoms.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a CES-D score in the bottom 50th percentile is comparatively limited. The participant's health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z-score: 0.3), which might conventionally be associated with better mental health, although its correlation with CES-D is only moderately negative (-0.39). Their substance use is moderate to low, not indicating overt maladaptive coping. Exercise frequency is also moderate, which can be a protective factor. While the resting heart rate is below average (Z-score: -0.47), its weak positive correlation (0.19) with CES-D implies lower RHR is associated with lower CES-D, which is somewhat counter-intuitive given the overall profile of distress. Furthermore, many wearable-derived metrics (Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability, sleep duration, sleep start time) have negligible direct correlations with CES-D in this dataset, which could be interpreted as not strongly pushing the score towards either end of the distribution based solely on those correlations.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The preponderance of evidence strongly indicates that the participant's depressive symptom burden would place them in the top 50th percentile of the study population. Self-reported measures paint a clear picture of distress: elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.17, strong positive correlation 0.81), significantly high perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 1.47, moderate positive correlation 0.28), lower self-esteem (Z-score: -0.17, strong negative correlation -0.71), and lower current happiness (Z-score: -0.53, moderate negative correlation -0.46). Additionally, self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score: 9.0, Z-score: 1.05) is a major indicator.

These self-report findings are comprehensively supported by objective wearable data. The participant exhibits severe sleep deprivation (median sleep duration 6h 9m, Z-score: -1.29), an exceptionally late and irregular sleep schedule (median sleep start 03:36:45, sleep start time SD Z-score: 1.04), and frequent napping (Z-score: 3.05). These sleep disruptions are physiologically echoed by unusually elevated heart rate during early morning hours (1-4 AM, Z-scores up to 2.07 above mesor), suggesting poor sleep quality and heightened physiological arousal during typical rest. Moreover, objective measures of circadian rhythmicity indicate significant dysregulation: very low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.98), high intradaily variability (Z-score: 0.95), and a blunted heart rate amplitude (Z-score: -1.38), all pointing to an irregular and poorly structured daily rhythm, which is a common correlate of depressive states. The observed decline in GPA further suggests potential functional impairment.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Given the confluence of elevated psychological distress (anxiety, stress), impaired self-perception (low self-esteem, happiness, trust), profound objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and a significantly dysregulated physiological circadian rhythm, the evidence overwhelmingly points towards a high burden of depressive symptomatology. The strong correlations of several key self-report measures with CES-D, combined with the extreme deviations from population norms in sleep and circadian metrics (which are robustly linked to depression in general literature), outweigh the few contradictory or weakly correlated data points. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's CES-D score falls into the top 50% of the study population distribution (i.e., above the median of 11.0).

37218,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex psychological and behavioral profile, with several indicators pointing towards elevated depressive symptomatology, juxtaposed with some relatively adaptive behaviors. Psychologically, the participant reports significant trait anxiety, with a STAI score of 49.0, placing them in the ""anxious"" classification (Z-score 0.76), a measure strongly positively correlated with CES-D (0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably low (Score 29.0, Z-score -1.29), showing a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). Subjective happiness is also considerably lower than the population average (Score 2.0, Z-score -1.61), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.46). This constellation of high anxiety, low self-esteem, and low happiness strongly suggests an internal emotional state consistent with heightened depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is likewise below average (Z-score -0.95), correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.39). Interestingly, perceived stress is exceptionally low (Score 14.0, Z-score -2.07), which typically would indicate better mental health; however, its positive correlation with CES-D (0.29) suggests that lower perceived stress might be associated with lower CES-D, making this finding somewhat anomalous in the context of other symptoms or perhaps indicative of emotional numbing or disengagement from stressors.

Sleep patterns, both self-reported and objectively measured, are markedly disturbed. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance, as indicated by a PSQI score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52). Wearable data corroborates this, showing a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 1 minute, which is significantly shorter than the study population average (Z-score -1.45). Furthermore, the median sleep start time is exceptionally late at 03:56:30. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals an atypical pattern of physiological arousal during typical resting hours. Heart rate is significantly elevated above the mesor during the late evening and early sleep hours (e.g., 9-10 PM: 14.91 bpm above mesor, Z-score 1.2; 1-2 AM: 4.03 bpm above mesor, Z-score 1.67), suggesting difficulty in physiological de-escalation prior to and during the initial phase of sleep. This pattern of prolonged high heart rate into the night is inconsistent with healthy sleep physiology and supports the self-reported sleep disturbance.

Behaviorally, the participant shows reduced engagement in physical activity, reporting ""not at all"" for exercising alone (Z-score -1.93) and exercising with others (Z-score -1.58), with these categories showing weak negative correlations with CES-D, indicating reduced exercise may correspond to higher CES-D scores. Despite this, the participant engages in sports 1-2 times a month, which is near average. In terms of daily recreation, the participant spends a substantial amount of time listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z-score 2.06) and socializing with friends (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.74), the latter being a notably high level of social engagement. However, more passive activities like watching TV/videos/movies are also higher than average (1-2 hours, Z-score 1.28). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show a lower-than-average amplitude (Z-score -0.63), which can indicate a blunted daily physiological rhythm, a pattern sometimes associated with mood disorders. The acrophase, or peak of the heart rate rhythm, occurs relatively late at 6:29 PM. During typical daytime hours, particularly the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 6-7 PM: Z-score -1.45; 7-8 PM: Z-score -1.68), hourly heart rate deviations are notably lower than peers, suggesting reduced cardiovascular activity during these periods, potentially reflecting lower physical engagement. Overall, a pattern emerges of profound sleep disruption and internal distress coexisting with some active social engagement and a very low perception of stress.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%)**:
A significant body of evidence suggests the participant's CES-D score would likely fall into the top half of the study population. Self-report measures show elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.76, r=0.81), notably low self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z=-1.29, r=-0.71), and significantly reduced happiness (Happy Z=-1.61, r=-0.46). All these measures have strong correlations with CES-D in directions consistent with higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance (PSQI score 10.0, Z=1.52), and objective wearable data confirms profoundly short sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z=-1.45) and an extremely delayed median sleep start time (03:56:30). The analysis of hourly heart rate reveals elevated physiological arousal during late evening and early night hours, when heart rate should be declining for sleep, alongside a blunted circadian amplitude (Z=-0.63). The participant also reports lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.95, r=-0.39) and significantly less exercise than peers, particularly exercising alone or with others (Z=-1.93, Z=-1.58).

**Evidence for a Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%)**:
Contrasting these indicators, the participant reports exceptionally low perceived stress (PSS Z=-2.07). While the correlation of PSS with CES-D is positive (r=0.29), implying that *lower* stress is associated with *lower* CES-D, this singular finding is a significant counterpoint. Additionally, the participant reports high levels of socializing with friends (Z=1.74), which, while having a negligible correlation with CES-D, represents an active pro-social behavior often associated with better mental well-being. Other wearable circadian metrics like Interdaily Stability (Z=0.58) and Intradaily Variability (Z=0.03) are within or above average ranges, suggesting some regularity in the daily rhythm that might not immediately point to severe disruption.

**Holistic Analysis**:
Despite the very low perceived stress and high social engagement, the overwhelming evidence from multiple domains points to a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The strong negative indicators from core psychological traits (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness) are highly predictive of higher CES-D scores, supported by strong correlations. The severe and multi-faceted sleep disturbance, encompassing poor subjective quality, objectively short duration, an extremely late sleep onset, and physiological arousal during sleep hours, is a potent correlate of depression. The blunted circadian amplitude and atypical heart rate patterns further suggest physiological dysregulation. While the participant's self-reported stress is notably low, its interpretation alongside profound emotional distress and sleep disturbance suggests a complex presentation where this particular metric may not fully capture the internal state of depressive symptomatology as measured by CES-D. The cumulative weight of evidence, especially from psychological measures and objective sleep data, strongly indicates that this participant is experiencing a higher degree of depressive symptom burden compared to the general student population.

17932,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by robust physiological regulation and strong psychological resources, alongside notable areas of subjective distress, particularly concerning sleep. Objectively, the participant demonstrates a highly regular and stable circadian rhythm, reflected in high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.08), low Intradaily Variability (Z-score -1.24), and very high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 1.65). These metrics, derived from heart rate data, indicate a predictable and well-entrained daily physiological pattern, generally associated with positive health outcomes. Further supporting this physiological robustness are a very low resting heart rate (48.65 bpm, Z-score -1.13) and a low MESOR (66.57, Z-score -1.01), both suggestive of strong cardiovascular fitness and overall low physiological arousal. The heart rate deviations from the MESOR follow a typical diurnal pattern, with lowest values during the early morning sleep hours (e.g., -25.81 bpm at 7-8 AM, Z-score -1.53) and elevated activity during waking hours, with a prominent peak around midday (18.63 bpm at 11 AM-12 PM, Z-score 1.99).

Behaviorally, the participant reports high levels of physical activity, exercising alone ""three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.07) and engaging in sports and exercise with others at an above-average frequency. This aligns with the physiological markers of fitness. Academically, the participant maintains an excellent and stable GPA above 3.8. Psychologically, several self-report measures indicate significant strengths: very high self-esteem (RSES score 44, Z-score 0.82, strongly negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.71), low trait anxiety (STAI score 35, Z-score -0.62, positively correlated with CES-D at 0.81), low perceived stress (PSS score 18, Z-score -0.98, positively correlated with CES-D at 0.28), and high satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.97, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.39). Recreational habits include significantly high engagement in video games (1-2 hours, Z-score 2.47) and reading (16-30 minutes, Z-score 1.3), alongside moderate alcohol consumption.

Despite these numerous indicators of well-being and adaptive functioning, the participant reports severe subjective sleep disturbance, as evidenced by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 13 (Z-score 2.9). This classification of ""Disturbed Sleep"" is profoundly significant, indicating a subjective experience of very poor sleep quality despite objective wearable data showing long median sleep duration (8 hours 35 minutes, Z-score 1.74) and low variability in sleep duration and start times. This discrepancy suggests that while objective sleep quantity and regularity are robust, the participant subjectively experiences their sleep as unrefreshing or problematic. Additionally, the participant reports lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.41) and slightly below-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, negatively correlated with CES-D at -0.46), both of which align with potential internal distress.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

The evaluation of the participant's overall depressive symptom burden reveals a complex interplay between strong protective factors and significant subjective distress.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits a substantial array of characteristics typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Psychologically, they report low trait anxiety (Z-score -0.62), high self-esteem (Z-score 0.82), low perceived stress (Z-score -0.98), and high satisfaction with their physical health (Z-score 0.97). These positive self-report measures are further supported by objective indicators such as consistent high academic performance (GPA 3.8+), high engagement in physical exercise, and a healthy Body Mass Index. Physiologically, the wearable data demonstrates exceptional circadian regularity (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.08, Intradaily Variability Z-score -1.24, Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z-score 1.65) and strong cardiovascular health (low Resting Heart Rate Z-score -1.13, low Mesor Z-score -1.01). Objective sleep metrics show prolonged sleep duration (Median Sleep Duration Z-score 1.74) and remarkable consistency in sleep timing and duration, suggesting a well-structured sleep-wake cycle. The correlations provided generally support these protective factors aligning with lower CES-D scores; for instance, high self-esteem has a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, meaning the participant's high self-esteem would predict a lower CES-D. Similarly, low anxiety, low stress, high health satisfaction, and lower heart rate metrics correlate with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
A critical piece of evidence pointing towards an elevated depressive symptom burden is the participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 13, which corresponds to an extreme Z-score of 2.9. This indicates profound subjective sleep disturbance, a cardinal symptom frequently associated with depression, regardless of objective sleep duration or regularity. While the specific correlation between PSQI and CES-D is not provided, the clinical significance of such a high PSQI score in relation to mental health symptoms is well-established. Additionally, the participant reports lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1) and slightly below-average current happiness (Z-score -0.53). Both of these self-reported traits, while less extreme in their Z-scores than the PSQI, are negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41 for trust, -0.46 for happiness), meaning the participant's lower scores on these measures would predict a higher CES-D score. The objectively long sleep duration, while often a marker of health, could also be considered in the context of hypersomnia, a symptom seen in some presentations of depression, particularly when combined with severe subjective sleep dissatisfaction.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant demonstrates a wide range of psychological strengths, robust physical health, high academic functioning, and exemplary physiological and objective sleep regularity, the magnitude of subjective distress reported in key areas cannot be overlooked. The extremely high PSQI score (Z-score 2.9) represents a severe subjective experience of poor sleep quality, which is a core feature of depressive symptomatology and carries significant weight in assessing overall burden. This profound subjective distress, coupled with lower self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust (which both correlate with higher CES-D scores), suggests an internal struggle that likely translates to an elevated CES-D score. Despite the presence of numerous protective factors and high objective functioning, the intense subjective symptom of sleep disturbance, a central component of depression, is a dominant feature. Therefore, considering the paramount importance of subjective experience in mental health assessment and the extreme deviation of the PSQI score, the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would likely place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

81420,25.0,0.8393782383419689,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile indicates several notable patterns. A high level of trait anxiety is observed, with a STAI score of 50.0 (Z-score 0.86), classifying the individual as 'anxious,' a metric strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is considerably below the population average (RSES score 31.0, Z-Score -1.01), a factor that exhibits a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.71). Perceived stress levels are also above average (PSS score 23.0, Z-Score 0.38), showing a positive, albeit weaker, correlation with CES-D (r=0.28). Furthermore, self-reported satisfaction with physical health is notably low (Score 2.78, Z-score -1.11), negatively correlating with CES-D (r=-0.39). Despite these indicators, self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Score 4.0, Z-Score 0.55), which typically correlates negatively with CES-D.

Sleep patterns present a mixed picture, yet indicate significant disturbance. The participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep quality, as evidenced by a PSQI score of 8.0 (Z-Score 0.59). Wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 12 minutes, which is average for the study population (Z-Score 0.02), and sleep duration variability is slightly below average (Standard Deviation of 87 minutes, Z-Score -0.31). However, the median sleep start time is notably late at 02:40:30, and the variability in sleep start time is slightly above average (93 minutes, Z-Score 0.22), suggesting an irregular sleep schedule despite adequate overall duration. This combination of subjective sleep disturbance and a late, somewhat inconsistent sleep-wake schedule can contribute to compromised well-being.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal characteristics suggestive of altered autonomic regulation and circadian rhythmicity. The participant's mesor (average heart rate) is 78.34 bpm (Z-Score 0.6) and resting heart rate is 62.6 bpm (Z-Score 0.53), both slightly elevated compared to the study population mean and positively correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.19). Analysis of the heart rate-based circadian rhythm indicates lower-than-average interdaily stability (0.29, Z-Score -0.99) and intradaily variability (0.31, Z-Score -1.66), along with a reduced amplitude (8.49, Z-Score -0.74). These metrics collectively suggest a less regular and less pronounced daily physiological rhythm. While the hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor demonstrate typical diurnal patterns of arousal during the day and appropriate physiological slowing during the early morning sleep period (e.g., values well below mesor from 3-7 AM), the overall dampened and less stable rhythm could reflect underlying physiological stress or dysregulation.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant demonstrates relatively high levels of physical activity, with above-average engagement in exercising alone (Z-Score 1.07), exercising with others (Z-Score 0.53), and sports (Z-Score 0.91). These activities generally show negative correlations with CES-D, indicating potential protective effects. Recreational habits include above-average engagement in reading (Z-Score 1.3) and video games (Z-Score 0.96), while internet usage is below average (Z-Score -1.16). Socializing with friends is reported at an average level (Z-Score 0.16). Alcohol consumption, specifically beer, is slightly above average (Z-Score 1.01), but its correlation with CES-D is negligible, suggesting it is not a primary driver of depressive symptomatology in this individual.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant engages in higher-than-average levels of physical activity across multiple domains (exercising alone, with others, and sports), activities generally correlated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness is slightly above average, a factor typically inversely related to CES-D scores. Furthermore, the participant exhibits average total sleep duration and slightly less variability in sleep duration than the population. Their reduced internet usage, which has a positive correlation with CES-D, could also be considered a protective factor. Physiologically, the pronounced dip in heart rate during the early morning hours, reflecting deep rest, indicates a healthy aspect of their sleep physiology.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
A robust body of evidence points towards an elevated CES-D score. The participant reports significant trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.86, 'anxious') and markedly low self-esteem (RSES Z-Score -1.01), both of which are very strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (r=0.81 and r=-0.71, respectively). Additionally, self-reported sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI score 8.0), and perceived stress is above average (PSS Z-Score 0.38). Health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score -1.11). Objectively, the wearable data reveals a less stable and flatter heart rate-based circadian rhythm, with lower interdaily stability, intradaily variability, and amplitude, which can be associated with mental health challenges. Both the mesor and resting heart rate are slightly elevated compared to the population, correlating positively with CES-D. Finally, a very late median sleep start time (02:40:30) and increased variability in sleep start time contribute to a pattern of disrupted sleep-wake timing often seen with elevated depressive symptoms.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The collective evidence strongly suggests that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores. While positive coping behaviors like high physical activity and average sleep duration are present, these appear to be insufficient to counteract the substantial psychological vulnerabilities. The confluence of high anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep quality, high perceived stress, and a less robust physiological circadian rhythm, all of which are strongly associated with increased depressive symptomatology, points to an elevated CES-D score. The late and inconsistent sleep timing further supports a picture of disrupted mental and behavioral health.

67709,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"The participant’s psychological and behavioral data reveal a complex profile with several indicators suggestive of psychological distress and potential functional impairment. This multimodal analysis integrates self-reported psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological metrics to provide a comprehensive interpretation.

**Psychological Traits and Academic Performance**
The participant exhibits a notable psychological profile characterized by elevated anxiety and perceived stress, coupled with lower self-esteem. The self-reported STAI score of 46.0 (Z-score 0.46) indicates above-average trait anxiety, and this metric holds a strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D scores in the study population. Similarly, perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), is markedly high (score 26.0, Z-score 1.19), correlating positively with CES-D (0.28). Conversely, the participant's self-esteem score of 33.0 (Z-score -0.73) is below the population average, and this trait demonstrates a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D, indicating that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Despite these indicators, the participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22), which negatively correlate with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively). Academically, a significant decline in GPA is evident, dropping from approximately 3.46 in prior semesters to 2.13 in Fall 2016, suggesting considerable academic challenges during the study period.

**Sleep and Circadian Rhythms**
Sleep patterns present a mixed picture with indications of both quantity and quality issues. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0, despite a slightly negative Z-score (-0.33), classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep, which is a common feature of depressive symptomatology. Wearable data corroborates this with a high median sleep duration of 8 hours 16 minutes (Z-score 1.34), which is associated with slightly lower CES-D (-0.01 correlation), though this correlation is negligible. However, consistency in sleep duration is poor, indicated by a high standard deviation of 173 minutes (Z-score 1.65), a factor that positively correlates with CES-D (0.19). The participant also experiences an above-average frequency of naps (0.14 mean daily naps, Z-score 0.82), which positively correlates with CES-D (0.21). Sleep start times exhibit moderate variability (standard deviation of 98 minutes, Z-score 0.33). Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data reveals a lower overall mean heart rate (Mesor 67.87 bpm, Z-score -0.83), which is weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.2), suggesting a propensity towards lower CES-D based on this single metric. The circadian rhythm exhibits typical amplitude (Z-score 0.27) with an acrophase (peak activity) occurring at 6:15 PM. Measures of rhythm regularity, such as Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.24) and Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.6), are close to the population mean, though Autocorrelation at 24 hours is somewhat low (Z-score -1.12), indicating less consistency in daily activity cycles, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

**Daily Activity and Social Engagement**
Behavioral habits reflect a tendency towards specific activity choices and social engagement. The participant reports no usage of substances (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs), with negligible correlations to CES-D. Exercise habits are somewhat varied; while exercising alone occurs 1-2 times a week (Z-score 0.32), exercising with others is notably frequent (""Three times a week or more"", Z-score 1.23). This latter habit shows a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.24), indicating it may serve as a protective factor. However, participation in sports is reported as ""not at all"" (Z-score -1.09). Daily recreational activities include significantly higher internet usage (3-4 hours, Z-score 1.52) and listening to music (2-3 hours, Z-score 1.13), both of which positively correlate with CES-D (0.25). Conversely, the participant reports no time spent on watching TV/videos/movies, video games, or reading, with Z-scores notably below the mean. Socializing with friends falls within the typical range (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.16). A moderate amount of time is dedicated to a sedentary hobby (31 minutes an hour, Z-score 0.82), which also positively correlates with CES-D (0.11).

**Hourly Heart Rate Patterns**
Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates distinct daily physiological activity patterns. The participant typically exhibits very low heart rates in the early morning hours, with the lowest deviation observed between 6-7 AM (-19.66 bpm, Z-score -0.33). Heart rates gradually increase throughout the morning and early afternoon, reaching a significant peak in the late afternoon and early evening. The most pronounced elevation occurs between 5-6 PM, showing an exceptionally high deviation of 29.45 bpm from the mesor (Z-score 2.76), followed by a sustained elevation into the late evening. This pattern suggests a delayed and intense period of physiological arousal or activity concentrated in the late afternoon/evening, relative to the typical population pattern. The participant's resting heart rate (53.4 bpm, Z-score -0.56) is below average, which, given its positive correlation with CES-D (0.2), would suggest a lower CES-D score.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated depressive symptom burden stems from the participant's self-reported psychological traits. Significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46) and markedly lower self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.73) exhibit very strong correlations with CES-D (0.82 and -0.71, respectively), indicating a high likelihood of concurrent depressive symptoms. Elevated perceived stress (PSS Z-score 1.19, correlation 0.28) further compounds this. Behaviorally, the substantial and abrupt decline in academic performance (GPA dropping from ~3.46 to 2.13) represents a strong indicator of functional impairment or distress frequently associated with depression. Sleep patterns also suggest difficulties, with a PSQI score of 6 indicating clinically significant disturbed sleep, and high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.65, correlation 0.19) along with above-average napping (Z-score 0.82, correlation 0.21) being positively correlated with CES-D. Furthermore, the elevated engagement in solitary activities like internet usage (Z-score 1.52, correlation 0.25) and listening to music (Z-score 1.13, correlation 0.25) aligns with behavioral patterns that can accompany depressive states.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
Conversely, some data points suggest factors that are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports above-average happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.22), both of which are moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively). Social engagement through exercise is a notable protective factor, as the participant exercises with others significantly more frequently than average (Z-score 1.23), and this behavior has a negative correlation with CES-D (-0.24). Physiologically, a lower overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.83) and lower resting heart rate (Z-score -0.56) are present, which given their positive correlations with CES-D (0.2 for both), would suggest a propensity for lower CES-D scores. Additionally, an above-average median sleep duration (Z-score 1.34) is noted, although its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant benefits from protective factors such as positive affect, health satisfaction, and frequent social exercise, the cumulative weight of evidence strongly indicates an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. The very strong associations of elevated anxiety and low self-esteem with CES-D are particularly impactful. These are further reinforced by significantly elevated perceived stress and the substantial functional impact reflected in the academic decline. The objective measures of sleep disruption (variability, napping) and increased engagement in passive solitary activities provide additional support for increased depressive symptomatology. The physiological indicators suggesting a lower CES-D are outweighed by the robustness and centrality of the psychological and behavioral markers of distress. Therefore, considering the overall pattern of psychological vulnerability and functional challenges, it is most probable that the participant's CES-D score falls within the top half of the study population distribution.

36552,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"## Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits several notable psychological and behavioral patterns that warrant attention. Self-report measures indicate an elevated level of trait anxiety (STAI score of 44, Z-score 0.27) and above-average perceived stress (PSS score of 24, Z-score 0.65). These are accompanied by below-average self-reported current happiness (Z-score -0.53). Conversely, the participant reports slightly above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.26), trust (Z-score 0.18), and satisfaction with health (Z-score 0.55). While these positive traits generally correlate negatively with depressive symptoms in the study population, their presence does not entirely mitigate the other indicators of distress.

Sleep patterns present a significant area of concern. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7 (Z-score 0.13) classifies the participant's subjective sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep."" This self-report is corroborated by wearable data, which shows a significantly short median sleep duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes (Z-score -1.0) and a late median sleep start time of 01:28:30. Despite the short duration and late start, the participant demonstrates higher-than-average consistency in both sleep duration (standard deviation of 49 minutes, Z-score -1.17) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 49 minutes, Z-score -0.75). The combination of self-reported disturbance and objectively short, late sleep is a prominent finding.

Analysis of heart rate derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals significant physiological dysregulation. The participant displays low interdaily stability (Z-score -0.99) and high intradaily variability (Z-score 1.23), suggesting irregular and fragmented activity-rest rhythms across and within days. Furthermore, the amplitude of their heart rate rhythm is significantly lower than the population mean (Z-score -1.07), indicating a less pronounced difference between peak and trough physiological states. The resting heart rate is also elevated (64.3 bpm, Z-score 0.73), pointing to a generally heightened state of physiological arousal. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show a pronounced peak in activity relative to the mesor around 3-4 PM, coinciding with the recorded acrophase of 4:02 PM.

Regarding daily activities, the participant reports engaging in solitary exercise at a significantly higher frequency than peers (Z-score 1.07) but less frequently in exercise with others (Z-score -0.88) or sports. Socializing with friends is also reported at a lower frequency than average (Z-score -0.62). Substance use is low across all categories. While the correlations between these specific activity patterns and CES-D are generally weak, the pattern of higher individual physical activity coupled with lower social engagement may represent a notable behavioral characteristic.

## Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) includes the participant's elevated trait anxiety, below-average current happiness, and above-average perceived stress, which are all psychological indicators that correlate with higher depressive symptoms. Critically, both self-reported (PSQI) and objective wearable data demonstrate significant sleep disturbance, characterized by inadequate sleep duration and a late sleep onset. Further, objective heart rate data reveals significant disruption in circadian rhythmicity, evidenced by low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, and reduced amplitude, alongside an elevated resting heart rate—all physiological markers frequently associated with increased depressive symptomatology. The lower engagement in socializing with friends also aligns with patterns sometimes observed in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.

Conversely, some factors might suggest a lower or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile). The participant reports slightly above-average self-esteem, trust, and satisfaction with health, which are traits that typically correlate negatively with depressive symptoms. Their engagement in solitary exercise is high, and while their sleep duration is short and late, it exhibits greater consistency (lower standard deviation) than that of their peers, which could be a mitigating factor. However, the overall weight of the evidence, particularly concerning the profound sleep disturbances, significant circadian rhythm disruption, elevated physiological arousal, and self-reported negative emotional states (anxiety, low happiness, stress), strongly suggests an elevated burden of depressive symptoms. These indicators collectively point towards a psychological and physiological profile that is more consistent with the upper half of the depressive symptom distribution in the study population.

63138,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant’s self-reported psychological profile suggests a relatively favorable state of mental well-being with respect to depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is slightly below the study population mean (Score 40.0, Z-score -0.13), and this measure has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), indicating a lower propensity for elevated depressive symptoms. Similarly, the participant's self-esteem is average (Score 38.0, Z-Score -0.03), which, considering its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), does not suggest a risk for higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports above-average levels of happiness (Z-Score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (Z-Score 0.5), both moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, providing further support for potentially lower depressive symptom burden. Satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.38) is also slightly above average and negatively correlated with CES-D. Although perceived stress levels are slightly above the population average (Score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), the weak positive correlation (0.28) with CES-D indicates a less substantial association with depressive symptoms compared to other psychological variables.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates consistent high academic performance with GPAs ranging from 3.81 to 3.94, suggesting a strong capacity for functional engagement. Regarding lifestyle habits, the participant reports above-average consumption of beer (Z-Score 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-Score 0.94), while abstaining from recreational and non-prescribed drug use. The correlations between alcohol consumption and CES-D in this dataset are negligible, suggesting this pattern of substance use is not strongly indicative of depressive symptoms. Exercise patterns are mixed, with less frequent solo exercise (Z-Score -1.18) but slightly more frequent participation in sports (Z-Score 0.25). General daily recreational habits, including passive activities like watching TV and listening to music, and active engagement such as reading and socializing, are largely below average compared to peers. Notably, time spent socializing with friends is below average (Z-Score -0.62), though its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

Objective sleep data derived from Fitbit devices indicates excellent sleep duration and regularity. The participant’s median sleep duration of 8 hours and 21 minutes is significantly longer than the study population average (Z-Score 1.45). This extended sleep duration, although negligibly correlated with CES-D in this specific dataset, generally contributes to overall well-being. Both sleep duration and sleep start time exhibit less variability than the population average (Z-Score -0.8 for duration SD, Z-Score -0.54 for start time SD), with these lower variabilities weakly correlating with lower CES-D scores. While the median sleep start time of 01:37 AM is late, its low variability suggests a consistent, albeit delayed, sleep schedule. The absence of daily naps (Z-Score -0.86) is also noteworthy, as less napping is associated with lower CES-D in this study. Subjective sleep quality data from the PSQI is not available for assessment.

Analysis of wearable-derived heart rate data reveals patterns of physiological arousal and circadian rhythmicity. The participant's overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 77.14 bpm, Z-Score 0.44) and resting heart rate (62.9 bpm, Z-Score 0.56) are slightly above the population average, with both weakly positively correlated with CES-D. This could suggest a mild elevation in general physiological arousal. The circadian rhythm demonstrates an above-average amplitude (Z-Score 0.88), indicating a distinct daily variation in heart rate, with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring around 5:09 PM. Interdaily stability (Z-Score 0.17) is slightly above average, reflecting reasonable day-to-day rhythm regularity. However, a salient finding is the significantly elevated intradaily variability (IV: 0.71, Z-Score 1.16). High IV suggests a more fragmented or less smooth heart rate rhythm throughout the day, which can indicate physiological dysregulation or a less robust circadian system, even though its direct correlation with CES-D is negligible in this dataset.

The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor illustrate the participant's typical daily physiological activity. Heart rate deviations are markedly negative during the early morning hours (1-8 AM), consistent with a sleep period, reaching their lowest point around 6-7 AM (-17.94 bpm). In the morning, heart rate deviations at 8-9 AM (Z-Score -1.24) and 9-10 AM (Z-Score -1.1) are significantly lower than for peers, indicating a comparatively slower or later onset of physiological activation. Following this, heart rate rises sharply, becoming positive relative to the Mesor from 10-11 AM and remaining elevated throughout the afternoon and evening. A peak in physiological activity is observed between 6-7 PM (18.83 bpm deviation, Z-Score 1.1), which is above the population average for that specific hour, suggesting robust evening arousal or activity. This overall pattern points to a stable, but generally later, daily activity rhythm with elevated evening physiological engagement.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits substantial evidence supporting a relatively low or average burden of depressive symptoms. Key self-report measures are highly indicative: trait anxiety (STAI) is slightly below average (Z-score -0.13) and shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), implying lower anxiety is linked to lower CES-D. Self-esteem is average (Z-score -0.03) and has a strong negative correlation (-0.71), suggesting no increased risk for depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5) are both above average and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, further supporting a lower likelihood of depressive symptomatology. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score 0.38) and negatively correlated with CES-D. Objectively measured sleep provides additional support, with significantly longer median sleep duration (Z-score 1.45) and less variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.8) and sleep start time (Z-score -0.54), with lower variability in both metrics associated with lower CES-D. The participant’s lack of daily napping (Z-score -0.86) is also weakly associated with lower CES-D. Consistently high academic performance (GPA) suggests good functional capacity typically not associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
Some indicators suggest a potential for higher depressive symptoms, though their correlations with CES-D are generally weaker. The most prominent physiological finding is the significantly elevated intradaily variability (IV) in heart rate (Z-score 1.16). While the direct correlation of IV with CES-D in this dataset is negligible (-0.05), high IV is often considered a physiological marker of disrupted circadian rhythms and can be associated with mental health challenges. Other supporting factors include slightly above-average perceived stress (Z-score 0.38), mesor heart rate (Z-score 0.44), and resting heart rate (Z-score 0.56), all of which exhibit a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Behavioral patterns, such as exercising alone less frequently (Z-score -1.18) and less frequent socializing (Z-score -0.62), are often associated with higher depressive symptoms, though their correlations in this dataset are weak or negligible. Above-average alcohol consumption also represents a potential, albeit weakly correlated, risk factor.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the multimodal data, the evidence for lower depressive symptomatology significantly outweighs that for higher symptomatology. The self-reported psychological measures (trait anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, trust, health satisfaction) are strongly correlated with CES-D and consistently indicate a profile associated with lower depressive symptoms. These direct and strong correlations provide compelling evidence. Furthermore, the objective sleep metrics demonstrate robust sleep duration and regularity, patterns generally considered protective against depression and, in this dataset, also associated with lower CES-D (for sleep variability and napping). While the elevated intradaily variability in heart rate is a notable physiological deviation, its negligible direct correlation with CES-D in this study limits its interpretive weight for *this specific outcome*. The other physiological and behavioral factors suggesting higher CES-D (stress, RHR, Mesor, exercise, socializing, alcohol use) are either weakly or negligibly correlated with CES-D, making them less impactful in the overall assessment of depressive symptom burden in the context of this study's correlations. Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, particularly from the strongly correlated psychological traits and healthy sleep patterns, the participant is more likely to have a CES-D score in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

16654,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"The participant presents a multifaceted profile characterized by strong psychological well-being indicators alongside specific areas of concern. Psychologically, the participant demonstrates a relatively low propensity for anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.72), above-average self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z-score 0.11), and lower-than-average perceived stress (Stress Z-score -0.44). These traits, particularly lower anxiety and higher self-esteem, correlate negatively and substantially with CES-D scores, suggesting a protective mental health profile. Academic performance is consistently high (GPAs of 3.6, 3.75, 4.0), indicating strong functional capacity during the academic semester. Health satisfaction is notably high (Z-score 1.3), which also correlates negatively with depressive symptoms. However, self-reported happiness is lower than average (Z-score -0.53), a metric that negatively correlates with CES-D, potentially pointing to a subtle area of anhedonia or reduced positive affect. Elevated substance use (beer and wine/liquor 1-2 times a week, Z-scores ~1.0) is present, yet the correlations with CES-D are negligible, suggesting these behaviors, while elevated, may not be strongly tied to depressive symptomology for this individual within the study context. In contrast, the participant is highly engaged in physical activity, particularly exercising with others (Z-score 1.23), and demonstrates high levels of social engagement (socializing with friends 2-3 hours daily, Z-score 0.95). These social and physical activities are generally associated with better mental health outcomes and could serve as significant protective factors.

Physiologically and behaviorally, the participant exhibits a highly regular and robust circadian rhythm, indicated by a high Interdaily Stability (Z-score 1.08) and a notably high Amplitude (Z-score 1.44) in heart rate fluctuations. These metrics suggest a strong and well-entrained biological clock, which is often associated with better overall health and mood regulation. The aggregated hourly heart rate data further supports this, showing significant deviations from the mesor during active daytime hours (e.g., Z-score 1.83 from 1-2 PM) and substantial reductions during sleep periods (e.g., Z-score -0.91 from 5-6 AM), reflecting clear and distinct activity-rest cycles. The resting heart rate (Z-score 0.18) is average to slightly below average, indicative of good cardiovascular fitness. Regarding sleep, the participant demonstrates consistent and sufficient objective sleep patterns: a median duration of 7 hours 46 minutes (Z-score 0.73), low variability in sleep duration (Z-score -1.04), and highly consistent, albeit late, sleep start times (Z-score -1.17 for variability). Despite these objectively favorable sleep metrics, the participant reports ""Disturbed Sleep"" on the PSQI (score 6.0), indicating a discrepancy between objective sleep architecture and subjective sleep quality or perceived restorativeness. While a slightly higher Mesor (Z-score 0.57) and resting heart rate show a weak positive correlation with CES-D, the overall wearable data points toward strong physiological regulation and consistent behavioral patterns.

In summary, the participant demonstrates a profile largely characterized by significant protective factors against depressive symptoms, including low anxiety, good self-esteem, low perceived stress, high academic functioning, extensive physical activity, robust social engagement, and highly regular, sufficient, and stable sleep and circadian rhythms. While subjective happiness is lower and self-reported sleep quality is disturbed, these are substantially outweighed by numerous positive indicators across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains that typically correlate with lower depressive symptom burden.

29134,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates a generally favorable state across several key domains. Anxiety, as measured by the STAI–Trait scale, is low with a Z-score of -0.33, indicating that the participant reports less chronic anxiety than the average study population. This is notably relevant given the high positive correlation (0.81) between STAI scores and CES-D, suggesting that lower anxiety is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms in this context. Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11), and self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55), health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55), and interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83) are also above the population mean. These indicators, particularly self-esteem (correlation -0.71), happiness (correlation -0.46), and health satisfaction (correlation -0.39), show strong negative correlations with CES-D, suggesting they are protective factors against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17), aligning with a profile of lower psychological distress. Academically, however, a declining GPA trend is observed across semesters (3.28 to 2.9), which could represent an area of concern or a potential stressor.

Regarding behavioral habits, the participant engages in frequent exercise, particularly social sports (exercising with others Z-score 1.23, sports Z-score 1.58), which are well above the population average. This consistent physical activity, especially in social contexts, is typically associated with better mental health outcomes, consistent with the negative correlations observed with CES-D for these activities. Substance usage for beer, wine, and liquor is slightly above average, but recreational and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreation habits show an above-average engagement in reading (Z-score 1.3), while socializing with friends (outside of structured exercise) is below average (Z-score -0.62) and listening to music is notably absent (Z-score -1.19). The lower engagement in unstructured socializing and music listening could be points of interest, though their correlations with CES-D are weak.

A significant area of concern pertains to sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 11.0, with a Z-score of 1.98, places the participant in the ""Disturbed Sleep"" category, indicating clinically significant subjective sleep difficulties. Objectively, while the median sleep duration is adequate at 7 hours 40 minutes (Z-score 0.6), there is extremely high variability in sleep patterns. Sleep duration standard deviation (159 minutes, Z-score 1.33) and especially sleep start time standard deviation (183 minutes, Z-score 2.2) are considerably elevated, reflecting a highly irregular and inconsistent sleep-wake schedule. These objective measures of sleep variability, along with the incidence of daily naps (Z-score 0.61), are all positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting a potential link to depressive symptomatology.

Physiological data derived from wearable metrics indicate an average level of interdaily stability (Z-score 0.0) and slightly below-average intradaily variability (Z-score -0.18) in heart rate, suggesting a generally consistent pattern of activity and rest within and across days, despite the self-reported sleep irregularity. Resting heart rate (55.4 bpm, Z-score -0.33) and mesor (69.87 bpm, Z-score -0.56) are below the population average, which typically indicates good cardiovascular fitness. However, the aggregate hourly heart rate data reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. There is a pronounced midday peak in heart rate deviation, with values significantly above the mesor between 11 AM and 1 PM (Z-scores 0.88 to 1.25), indicating higher than average cardiovascular activity during this period. Another elevation is observed in the evening, with a relatively late acrophase at 5:06 PM, suggesting a delayed peak in physiological activity. While the lower resting heart rate and mesor are positive indicators, the pronounced midday and evening physiological elevations could reflect periods of heightened activity or potential stress, which may interact with the reported sleep disturbances.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant consistently reports a strong psychological profile indicative of lower depressive symptom burden. Their STAI-Trait score is low (Z-score -0.33), indicating less chronic anxiety, which is highly negatively correlated with CES-D (a positive correlation of 0.81 for STAI means lower STAI predicts lower CES-D). Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z-score 0.11) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), suggesting protection against depressive symptoms. Similarly, above-average self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) are both negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.39, respectively). Perceived stress is slightly below average (Z-score -0.17), further supporting a profile of lower psychological distress. Additionally, the participant engages in frequent physical activity, particularly social exercise, which typically serves as a protective factor against depression and is negatively correlated with CES-D. The lower resting heart rate and mesor suggest good cardiovascular fitness, generally associated with better health outcomes.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The most compelling evidence for elevated depressive symptoms comes from the severe sleep disturbances. The PSQI score (11.0, Z-score 1.98) indicates clinically significant poor subjective sleep quality. Objectively, the participant exhibits extremely high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.33) and especially sleep start times (Z-score 2.2), reflecting a highly irregular sleep-wake cycle. These metrics, along with above-average napping, are all positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting a potential link to depressive symptoms. The observed decline in GPA could also be a subtle indicator of distress or challenges that might contribute to depressive symptoms. The pronounced midday physiological arousal patterns, while not directly correlated with CES-D in a strong manner in this dataset, could also be a manifestation of underlying stress or an active lifestyle that struggles to regulate for sleep.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the participant exhibits severe and highly irregular sleep patterns that are positively correlated with CES-D, the comprehensive self-reported psychological measures strongly indicate a profile inconsistent with elevated depressive symptoms. The consistent reports of low anxiety, high self-esteem, above-average happiness, health satisfaction, and low perceived stress, coupled with their strong negative correlations with CES-D, are powerful indicators against a high CES-D score. The correlations for positive mental health indicators (e.g., self-esteem -0.71, happiness -0.46, STAI -0.81 if interpreted inversely) are substantially stronger than those for sleep disturbances (e.g., PSQI correlation ~0.2). This suggests that in this dataset, the overall subjective psychological state is a more dominant predictor of CES-D scores than sleep irregularity alone. While the sleep issues are a significant concern and may represent a primary problem or a singular area of struggle, the participant's broader psychological well-being, as measured across multiple validated scales, points towards a lower overall burden of depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite the sleep challenges, it is more likely that the participant's CES-D score falls into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

24029,21.0,0.7927461139896373,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's psychological profile is characterized by elevated trait anxiety and significantly reduced self-esteem, alongside high perceived stress. Their STAI-Trait score of 50, corresponding to a Z-score of 0.86, indicates anxiety levels notably higher than the study population mean and is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81). Similarly, their Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 29, with a Z-score of -1.29, signifies substantially lower self-esteem, which is robustly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.71). The participant also reported a Perceived Stress Scale score of 30, a Z-score of 2.28, indicating perceived stress levels well above the population average, moderately correlated with CES-D scores (0.28). In contrast, their self-reported happiness score of 4 (Z-score 0.55) is slightly above the population mean, a factor negatively correlated with CES-D scores (-0.46), suggesting a potential counterbalance to other indicators of distress. Health satisfaction (Z-score -0.45) is slightly below average, consistent with potential underlying issues.

Regarding sleep patterns, the participant reported a PSQI score of 6, which clinically indicates disturbed sleep, although their Z-score of -0.33 suggests their subjective sleep quality is slightly better than the average for this study population. Objectively, wearable data reveals a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 46 minutes (Z-score -0.52), which is moderately shorter than the population median. Variability in sleep duration (Z-score 0.02) and sleep start time (Z-score 0.36) are near or slightly above the population average, respectively, indicating some consistency but also a tendency towards minor irregularities in sleep timing. The participant reports no daily naps (Z-score -0.86), indicating less napping than the population mean.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle, reporting exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports ""three times a week or more,"" with high positive Z-scores (1.07, 1.23, 1.58) across all categories. These activities are consistently negatively correlated with CES-D scores, suggesting a potentially protective behavioral pattern. The participant abstains from substance use, reporting ""Not at all"" for all categories, with Z-scores indicating significantly lower usage than the population. However, their recreational habits reveal a preference for solitary and screen-based activities; they engage in ""Video Games"" (Z-score 2.47), ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" (Z-score 1.28), and ""Listening to Music"" (Z-score 2.06) at frequencies significantly above the mean, while ""Socializing with Friends"" (Z-score -0.62) is notably below average. This pattern suggests a potential imbalance between active, often solitary, pursuits and social engagement.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices indicates a generally structured circadian rhythm, with average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.09) and a slightly below-average resting heart rate (54.6 bpm, Z-score -0.42). However, intradaily variability (IV) is elevated (Z-score 1.09), potentially suggesting some fragmentation or erratic activity patterns within the day. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor illustrate a robust daily physiological cycle, characterized by pronounced decreases during typical sleep hours (e.g., -23.05 bpm deviation from 11-12am, Z-score -3.95) followed by a sharp and significant increase in activity during the early morning (e.g., +17.63 bpm deviation from 6-7am, Z-score 4.77). This early activation suggests a consistent morning routine and rapid physiological arousal, with sustained activity throughout the day peaking in the late afternoon (e.g., +20.64 bpm deviation from 5-6pm, Z-score 1.48) before gradually declining towards bedtime.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%) is compelling, primarily driven by core psychological vulnerabilities. The participant's elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.86) and significantly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.29) are particularly strong indicators, given their exceptionally high correlations with CES-D scores (0.81 and -0.71, respectively). Additionally, very high perceived stress levels (PSS Z-score 2.28) contribute significantly to this pattern. Although the PSQI Z-score is slightly better than the population average, the score of 6 still signifies clinically disturbed sleep, which is generally associated with increased depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, below-average social engagement with friends could be a contributing factor.

Conversely, there is substantial evidence for a relatively low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%). The participant demonstrates a highly active lifestyle, exercising frequently across multiple modalities (all exercise categories above 1 standard deviation from the mean), which is strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Their complete abstinence from substance use is also a protective factor. Self-reported happiness is above average (Z-score 0.55), which negatively correlates with CES-D. Other protective factors include above-average interpersonal trust and a slightly lower-than-average resting heart rate. Academically, the participant maintains consistently high GPAs, suggesting sustained cognitive function and adaptive coping in this domain.

Holistically, the profound impact of the participant's elevated trait anxiety, significantly reduced self-esteem, and very high perceived stress, as indicated by their Z-scores and strong correlations with CES-D, presents a formidable burden. While the participant exhibits commendable engagement in physical activity, above-average happiness, and strong academic performance, these strengths appear to act as coping mechanisms or indicators of resilience rather than fully negating the severe underlying psychological vulnerabilities. The magnitude and direct relevance of anxiety, self-esteem, and stress to depressive symptomatology strongly suggest that the participant experiences an elevated level of depressive symptoms.

35361,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The participant exhibits a generally positive psychological profile, characterized by lower-than-average trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and elevated self-reported happiness. Specifically, the STAI score of 38.0 (Z-score -0.33) indicates a ""not anxious"" classification, aligning with the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D, suggesting lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem, measured by the RSES, is high at 40.0 (Z-score 0.26), which, given its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), further supports a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology. Self-reported happiness is also above the population average (Z-score 0.55), and satisfaction with physical health is elevated (Z-score 0.55), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D. Perceived stress, however, is near the population mean (Z-score -0.17), indicating an average level of stress experience, which has a weak positive correlation with CES-D. A notable deviation from this otherwise positive profile is the participant's lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1), a characteristic that, with its moderate negative correlation to CES-D, could potentially indicate a slightly higher propensity for depressive symptoms, although this stands in contrast to most other self-reported psychological measures.

The participant demonstrates good subjective sleep quality and objective sleep regularity. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score -1.26) classifies their sleep as ""Good Sleep,"" indicating minimal self-reported difficulties. Fitbit-derived sleep statistics corroborate a consistent sleep pattern; the standard deviation for both sleep duration (61 minutes, Z-score -0.91) and sleep start time (73 minutes, Z-score -0.21) are below the population average, signifying high consistency in their sleep schedule. Furthermore, the participant reports taking no naps, which is also below the population average (Z-score -0.86) and associated with lower CES-D scores. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours and 56 minutes (Z-score -0.31), which is slightly below the population average but consistent.

Physiological data from wearable sensors indicate a robust and highly regular circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability (Z-score 1.49) is notably high, while intraday variability (Z-score -1.24) is significantly low, reflecting consistent daily patterns and consolidated activity/rest periods. A relatively high heart rate amplitude (Z-score 0.87) further points to a clear distinction between periods of rest and activity throughout the day. The acrophase, or peak heart rate activity, occurs at 4:28 PM, which is a typical afternoon peak. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations from the mesor (mean heart rate) reveal a pronounced physiological trough during the early morning hours, reaching its lowest point around 4-5 AM (Z-score -1.71), indicative of deep physiological rest. Heart rate progressively increases throughout the day, showing elevated activity levels from late morning through early evening, with peaks observed around 1-2 PM (Z-score 1.48) and 4-5 PM (Z-score 1.07), before gradually declining towards bedtime. This pattern of marked physiological distinction between rest and activity periods, combined with a lower-than-average resting heart rate of 49.8 bpm (Z-score -0.99), collectively suggests good cardiovascular health and a well-entrained circadian system.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains several health-promoting habits. They report abstaining from all listed substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, and non-prescribed drugs), placing them well below population averages for these activities. Exercise frequency is high, with self-reported exercise alone occurring ""Three times a week or more"" (Z-score 1.07) and exercise with others ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-score 0.53). Both forms of exercise are negatively correlated with CES-D, reinforcing a positive behavioral pattern. Leisure activities suggest a preference for reading, reported at ""16-30 minutes"" daily (Z-score 1.3), which is above average. Conversely, time spent on passive activities such as ""Watching TV/Videos/Movies"" and ""Internet Usage"" is very low (Z-scores -1.25 and -1.16, respectively). Socializing with friends is reported at ""31 minutes an hour"" (Z-score -0.62), which is below the population average, and this, along with the lower trust score, represents one of the few indicators that could potentially be associated with a slightly less robust social-emotional well-being, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To assess whether the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden would place them at the top or bottom half of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score, we analyze the available evidence across multiple modalities. The population CES-D median is 11.5.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
A substantial body of evidence suggests the participant likely falls into the bottom 50th percentile for CES-D scores. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33, classified as ""not anxious"") and high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 0.26), both of which are strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (correlations of 0.81 and -0.71, respectively, meaning lower anxiety and higher self-esteem predict lower CES-D). Subjective well-being is also favorable, with higher self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55), both negatively correlated with CES-D. Sleep quality is self-reported as good (PSQI Z-score -1.26), and objective wearable data confirms high consistency in sleep duration and start times (Z-scores -0.91 and -0.21, respectively). Consistent sleep patterns and fewer naps are positively correlated with lower CES-D. Behaviorally, the participant engages in above-average physical activity (exercise Z-scores 1.07 and 0.53) and reports no substance use, habits typically associated with better mental health outcomes. Physiologically, a robust and regular circadian rhythm is evident, characterized by high interdaily stability (Z-score 1.49) and low intraday variability (Z-score -1.24), alongside a lower-than-average resting heart rate (Z-score -0.99), all indicators of good physiological regulation and health, which generally correlate with lower depressive symptoms.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Evidence suggesting a high CES-D score is limited. The most notable indicator is the participant's lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.1). Given its negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41), lower trust could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Additionally, time spent socializing with friends is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.62), which, while having a negligible correlation with CES-D in this dataset (-0.01), can sometimes be a behavioral indicator of social withdrawal that might accompany depressive states. The median sleep duration of 6 hours and 56 minutes is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.31) and slightly below recommended guidelines, although it is not critically low and its correlation with CES-D is negligible. Perceived stress is near average (Z-score -0.17), which, with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (0.28), offers limited evidence for either extreme.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When considering the entirety of the multimodal data, the overwhelming majority of indicators point towards a profile consistent with lower or average depressive symptomatology. Strong positive psychological traits (low anxiety, high self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction), coupled with healthy behavioral patterns (frequent exercise, no substance use, high reading engagement), and robust physiological markers (good sleep quality and consistency, highly stable circadian rhythm, low resting heart rate), collectively weigh heavily against an elevated depressive symptom burden. While the lower interpersonal trust and slightly reduced social engagement present minor counterpoints, they are insufficient to override the consistent pattern of positive indicators observed across self-report, behavioral, and physiological data. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests the participant's CES-D score would fall within the bottom half of the study population distribution.

49086,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile blending strong psychological protective factors with notable behavioral and physiological patterns indicative of potential challenges. Psychologically, the participant reports significantly lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: -1.02) and remarkably higher self-esteem (RSES Z-score: 1.1) compared to the study population. These traits, combined with above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83) and consistent high academic performance (GPA consistently above 3.7), typically serve as buffers against depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant reports higher-than-average time spent socializing with friends (Z-score: 0.95), another activity generally associated with improved mental well-being. Conversely, the participant's self-reported happiness is lower than average (Z-score: -0.53), perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.38), and satisfaction with physical health is notably low (Z-score: -0.7). A significant behavioral concern is the near-complete absence of exercise across all categories, with Z-scores well below -1.0, a pattern generally linked to poorer mental health outcomes, although the specific correlations with CES-D in this dataset are weakly negative. Substance use involves moderate alcohol consumption, but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use.

Physiologically, sleep patterns and circadian rhythmicity present a notable area of concern. While self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, technically indicates ""Disturbed Sleep"" (score 6.0), the corresponding Z-score (-0.33) suggests that this is slightly better than the average for the study population, or at least not unusually poor. However, objective Fitbit data reveals a median sleep duration slightly above average (7 hours 18 minutes), but a very late median sleep start time of 02:19:30 AM. Although the variability in sleep start time is slightly lower than average, indicating a consistent schedule, this significantly delayed sleep onset is a key finding. This pattern is further supported by the aggregated hourly heart rate data, which shows a substantially elevated heart rate deviation from the mesor between 12-1 AM (Z-score: 1.66). This indicates significant physiological arousal during a period that should typically be characterized by decreasing activity and the onset of sleep, aligning directly with the reported late sleep start time. Other circadian rhythm metrics, such as Interdaily Stability, Intradaily Variability, Mesor, and Amplitude, are generally close to the population mean, with a slightly lower overall cardiovascular activity level (Mesor Z-score: -0.61) and a somewhat less pronounced daily heart rate variation (Amplitude Z-score: -0.57), and a late acrophase at 5:43 PM, which aligns with the delayed sleep-wake cycle.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To assess whether the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores, we consider the available evidence from both directions.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
The strongest indicators for a lower depressive symptom burden come from several self-reported psychological traits with substantial Z-scores and robust correlations with CES-D. The participant's trait anxiety (STAI score) is more than one standard deviation below the population mean (Z-score: -1.02) and classified as ""not anxious."" Given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI and CES-D, this suggests a notably lower CES-D score. Similarly, self-esteem (RSES score) is significantly high (Z-score: 1.1), and with a strong negative correlation (-0.71) to CES-D, this also strongly predicts lower depressive symptomatology. High interpersonal trust (Z-score: 0.83) with a moderate negative correlation (-0.41) further supports a lower CES-D. Additionally, consistent high academic performance and above-average social engagement are generally considered protective factors. The self-reported PSQI score, while categorized as ""disturbed sleep,"" has a Z-score of -0.33, indicating that subjectively perceived sleep quality is slightly better than the population mean, suggesting it doesn't contribute to an exceptionally high CES-D score relative to peers.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score: -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.7), both of which have moderate negative correlations with CES-D, implying higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is slightly elevated (Z-score: 0.38) with a weak positive correlation (0.28) to CES-D. The complete lack of engagement in exercise activities, while having weak negative correlations in this specific dataset, is a well-established risk factor for depression in general. Most notably, the objective sleep and physiological data point to significant circadian disruption and nocturnal physiological arousal: a very late median sleep start time (02:19:30 AM) combined with a significantly elevated heart rate (Z-score: 1.66) during the early morning hours (12-1 AM) are strong indicators of a delayed sleep-wake phase and difficulty achieving physiological rest, patterns often associated with increased depressive symptoms and mood disorders.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The participant presents a mixed picture. While self-reported measures of lower happiness, increased stress, and poor health satisfaction, along with a concerning lack of exercise and significant circadian misalignment (late sleep onset, nocturnal arousal), suggest a potential for elevated depressive symptoms, the evidence from the most strongly correlated psychological traits (trait anxiety and self-esteem) points strongly in the opposite direction. The participant's very low anxiety and high self-esteem, as indicated by their Z-scores and robust correlations with CES-D, represent powerful protective factors. Despite the objectively measured sleep and physiological challenges, and some negative subjective affective states, these core psychological strengths are likely to modulate the overall depressive symptom burden. Given the strong statistical associations provided, the significantly healthier scores on traits most correlated with CES-D suggest that the participant's overall CES-D score is more likely to fall within the lower range of the study population distribution.

The participant's self-reported psychological profile indicates elevated levels of trait anxiety and reduced self-esteem, which are robustly associated with depressive symptomatology. Specifically, the participant's STAI score of 47.0 places them in the ""anxious"" classification with a Z-score of 0.56, suggesting higher-than-average chronic anxiety, a finding strongly correlated (0.81) with CES-D scores. Concurrently, their self-esteem score of 34.0 (Z-Score -0.59) is below the population mean, a factor negatively correlated (-0.71) with CES-D. Perceived stress levels are slightly above average (PSS score 23.0, Z-score 0.38), and self-reported happiness is below average (score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), further aligning with indicators of psychological distress. Despite these challenges, the participant demonstrates consistent and improving academic performance, alongside above-average engagement in solitary exercise and social activities with friends. However, alcohol consumption is also notably above average.

Sleep quality and patterns exhibit significant disturbances. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite a slightly below-average Z-score. Objectively, wearable data indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours 56 minutes, which is slightly below the population average, and a notably late median sleep start time of 01:11 AM. There is also slightly above-average variability in sleep start times, suggesting inconsistent sleep routines.

Physiological data derived from wearable devices reveal prominent irregularities in the participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythm. The interdaily stability is considerably low (Value 0.23, Z-score -1.48), indicating a less consistent daily physiological pattern, and the amplitude of the rhythm is reduced (Value 8.34, Z-score -0.79), suggesting a flattened daily variation in cardiovascular activity. These patterns are commonly associated with disruptions in mood regulation. The acrophase, or peak of cardiovascular activity, is observed relatively late in the day at 4:25 PM, with aggregate hourly heart rate data showing significant deviations above the mesor during the late afternoon (e.g., 4-6 PM, with Z-scores up to 1.14). The participant's resting heart rate is slightly elevated (61.4 bpm, Z-score 0.39). Together, these circadian and heart rate metrics suggest an underlying physiological dysregulation that often accompanies depressive symptoms, characterized by reduced rhythm stability and a compressed or shifted daily physiological cycle.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence from the multimodal data strongly suggests that the participant's CES-D score would likely fall into the top 50% of the study population distribution.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th Percentile):**
The participant exhibits several self-reported psychological characteristics highly correlated with elevated depressive symptoms. Notably, their elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.56, classified as ""anxious,"" correlation 0.81) and lower self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.59, correlation -0.71) are significant indicators. Additionally, below-average self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.46) and above-average perceived stress (Z-score 0.38, correlation 0.28) align with a profile of increased depressive burden. Subjectively reported disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 6.0) is a frequent co-occurrence with depression. Critically, the wearable physiological data reveal significant circadian rhythm disruptions, including markedly low interdaily stability (Z-score -1.48) and reduced amplitude (Z-score -0.79), which are strong objective markers of physiological dysregulation often observed in individuals with mood disorders, even if their direct correlations with CES-D are weaker in this specific dataset.

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th Percentile):**
Conversely, some data points might suggest a lower or average depressive symptom burden. The participant reports higher-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5, correlation -0.41), which is negatively correlated with CES-D. Their academic performance has been consistently strong and improving, and they maintain above-average social engagement with friends (Z-score 0.95). Frequent exercise, even if primarily solitary, is generally considered beneficial for mental well-being. Furthermore, their median sleep duration (6 hours 56 minutes, Z-score -0.3) is only slightly below average, and napping is infrequent.

**Holistic Analysis:**
Despite positive factors such as strong academic performance, social engagement, and exercise frequency, the pervasive pattern of elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, reduced happiness, and subjective sleep disturbance strongly points towards a higher depressive symptom burden. The objective physiological dysregulation in circadian rhythms (low interdaily stability and amplitude) provides robust corroborating evidence for an underlying state of mental distress that transcends self-report biases. The combination of strong self-reported indicators negatively or positively correlated with CES-D and the significant objective physiological disruptions makes it highly probable that the participant experiences depressive symptoms at a level exceeding the median of the study population.

90079,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"**Task 1: Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents a complex picture. While trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is within the non-anxious range (Score: 38.0, Z-score: -0.33), suggesting a relatively low propensity for anxiety compared to the study population, this finding stands in contrast to several other indicators. The participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (Score: 34.0, Z-score: -0.59), which shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), implying an association with higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, self-reported happiness (Current: 3.0, Z-score: -0.53) is below the population mean, correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.46). Perceived stress levels are higher than average (Score: 24.0, Z-score: 0.65), correlating positively with CES-D (0.28). Furthermore, the participant exhibits significantly lower interpersonal trust (Score: 2.5, Z-score: -1.42), a factor moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41), suggesting a potential association with elevated depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Score: 4.0, Z-score: -0.2), also correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.39). Academically, the participant demonstrates an improving GPA trend, which is a positive indicator of functional capacity.

Sleep quality and habits are notably compromised for this participant. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0 (Z-score: 0.13) indicates disturbed sleep, a classification typically assigned to scores above 5. Wearable data corroborates and expands on this, showing a significantly short median sleep duration of 5 hours 54 minutes (Z-score: -1.59), which is substantially below the population average. Sleep timing is also irregular and delayed, with a median sleep start time of 01:53:44 and a high standard deviation in sleep start time (104 minutes, Z-score: 0.46). Similarly, the standard deviation of sleep duration (138 minutes, Z-score: 0.84) is considerably higher than average, indicating inconsistency in daily sleep length. These combined metrics suggest significant sleep deprivation, a highly irregular sleep schedule, and poor overall sleep quality, which are frequently associated with depressive symptomatology.

Analysis of heart rate data reveals significant disruption in the participant’s circadian rhythm. Non-parametric measures indicate notably low interdaily stability (Value: 0.21, Z-score: -1.65) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Value: 0.14, Z-score: -1.54), suggesting a lack of day-to-day regularity in activity and rest patterns. Conversely, intradaily variability is high (Value: 0.75, Z-score: 1.44), indicating a fragmented activity rhythm within days. Parametric cosinor analysis further highlights this disruption with a substantially lower-than-average amplitude (Value: 6.53, Z-score: -1.37), implying a flattened diurnal heart rate profile, characteristic of reduced physiological distinction between active and rest phases. The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurs late in the day at 4:54 PM, suggesting a phase-delayed rhythm. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor: 76.93, Z-score: 0.41) and resting heart rate (Value: 65.6, Z-score: 0.89) are both slightly higher than the population average, with resting heart rate showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveal that while the typical diurnal pattern of lower heart rates during sleep and higher during wakefulness is present, the heart rate dip during the early morning hours (e.g., 4-7 AM) is less pronounced (e.g., Z-scores up to 1.75 for 6-7 AM), suggesting less profound physiological quiescence during typical sleep periods. This pattern, combined with the low amplitude, indicates a generally dysregulated and flattened physiological rhythm.

In terms of lifestyle behaviors, the participant reports refraining from all listed substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs), with Z-scores indicating usage significantly below the population mean. Exercise habits are somewhat elevated, with reported participation in exercising alone and with others 1-2 times a week, corresponding to positive Z-scores. Engagement in sports is lower than average. Daily recreational habits indicate no participation in watching TV/videos/movies or reading, and below-average engagement in video games. Conversely, internet usage, listening to music, and socializing with friends are reported at average or slightly above-average levels. A sedentary hobby is also reported for 16-30 minutes daily. These behavioral patterns suggest a lack of substance use and moderate physical activity, which are generally considered positive health behaviors. However, the limited engagement in passive leisure activities like reading and watching TV, while not directly indicative of depressive symptoms, could reflect anhedonia or shifts in preferred activities, though internet usage and listening to music are maintained.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The participant exhibits numerous indicators strongly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Self-reported self-esteem is lower than average (Z-score: -0.59), which correlates strongly with higher CES-D scores. Similarly, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score: -0.53), and perceived stress is above average (Z-score: 0.65), both correlating in a manner consistent with higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, significantly low interpersonal trust (Z-score: -1.42) and slightly lower health satisfaction (Z-score: -0.2) also correlate with higher CES-D.
From a physiological and behavioral standpoint, the evidence for elevated depressive symptoms is particularly pronounced. The participant's PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep, comprehensively supported by Fitbit data showing markedly short sleep duration (Z-score: -1.59), highly irregular sleep timing (late median start time, high standard deviation in start time and duration), all consistent with sleep disruption often observed in depression. Circadian rhythm metrics reveal severe dysregulation, including critically low interdaily stability (Z-score: -1.65) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score: -1.54), high intradaily variability (Z-score: 1.44), and a flattened amplitude (Z-score: -1.37). These features signify an unstable, fragmented, and weak diurnal rhythm, which is a hallmark of circadian disruption frequently co-occurring with depression. The late acrophase (4:54 PM) and less pronounced heart rate dips during early morning hours further underscore this physiological dysregulation. The participant also displays an elevated resting heart rate (Z-score: 0.89), weakly correlating with higher CES-D.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The most notable indicator supporting a lower or median CES-D score is the participant's STAI-Trait score, which falls within the ""not anxious"" range (Z-score: -0.33). Given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D (0.81), this suggests a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant demonstrates consistent non-use of substances and engages in regular, above-average frequency of exercise, behaviors generally associated with positive mental health outcomes, although their direct correlation with CES-D in this dataset is weak or negligible. The improving GPA trend also suggests maintained academic functioning.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant reports relatively low trait anxiety and exhibits positive health behaviors such as abstinence from substance use and regular exercise, the vast majority of psychological and physiological data points towards a significant burden of depressive symptoms. The severe and multi-faceted sleep disturbance and circadian rhythm disruption, as measured by both self-report and objective wearable data, are particularly compelling indicators. These objective physiological markers, alongside self-reported lower self-esteem, reduced happiness, increased stress, and lower trust, collectively present a strong profile consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The STAI score, while a strong individual predictor, appears to be an outlier when viewed against the holistic pattern of distress and physiological dysregulation. Therefore, based on the comprehensive multimodal evidence, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution with regards to their CES-D score.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
22842,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"The participant’s self-reported psychological and behavioral data reveal several patterns indicative of elevated anxiety and subjective distress, alongside significant objective and subjective sleep disturbances. The score on the STAI-Trait scale is 46.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 0.46, which is above the population mean and classified as ""anxious."" This trait anxiety is notably highly correlated with CES-D scores (r=0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is slightly below average (Score 36.0, Z-score -0.31), a factor that is strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r=-0.71). Subjective happiness is also below the population mean (Score 3.0, Z-score -0.53), showing a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r=-0.46). While perceived stress is near the population average (Z-score 0.1), subjective sleep quality is significantly disturbed, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10.0 (Z-score 1.52), indicating clinically significant sleep difficulties. Conversely, the participant reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.88) and slightly above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.18), both of which are negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Academic performance shows variability, with a notable decrease in GPA from Spring 2016 to Fall 2016.

Objective sleep metrics derived from wearable data largely corroborate the self-reported sleep disturbance. While the median sleep duration of 7 hours and 51 minutes is above the population average (Z-score 0.83), the consistency of sleep patterns is notably compromised. The standard deviation of sleep duration (133 minutes, Z-score 0.73) and, particularly, sleep start time (164 minutes, Z-score 1.79) are both significantly higher than the study population average, indicating considerable irregularity in the participant's sleep schedule. The median sleep start time of 02:56:32 is notably late. Furthermore, the participant exhibits a significantly higher frequency of napping (Mean Daily Naps 0.28, Z-score 2.40). High variability in sleep duration and start time, as well as increased napping, show positive correlations with CES-D scores (r=0.20, r=0.21, and r=0.21, respectively).

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm features suggests some disruption, although correlations with CES-D are generally low for these specific metrics. The participant shows below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and reduced amplitude (Z-score -0.67) in their heart rate rhythm, suggesting less regularity and a blunted daily cardiovascular variation compared to the population mean. The acrophase, or peak in daily cardiovascular activity, occurs at 6:03 PM, which is relatively late. The overall mean heart rate (Mesor, Z-score -0.63) and resting heart rate (Z-score -0.47) are both slightly below average. Examination of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor indicates that the participant's heart rate in the early morning hours (e.g., 1-5 AM) is relatively higher than the population average for those hours (indicated by positive Z-scores on negative deviations from mesor), which could be suggestive of fragmented or restless sleep, aligning with self-reported sleep disturbance.

Behavioral habits include frequent solitary exercise (Z-score 1.07) and substantial time spent on video games (Z-score 1.71). Engagement in social activities is near average, while time spent listening to music and reading is below average. Substance use is low. While some behaviors like exercising alone might generally be considered positive for mental health, the overall pattern suggests a degree of disorganization in sleep-wake cycles and potentially solitary coping mechanisms. This comprehensive overview highlights a profile characterized by subjective distress, poor sleep quality, irregular sleep patterns, and some dysregulation in physiological rhythms, alongside slightly lower self-esteem and happiness.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a high CES-D score (top 50% of the study population distribution) is substantial. The participant exhibits above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.46), which is highly correlated with CES-D (r=0.81). Self-reported self-esteem is below average (Z-score -0.31) and happiness is also below average (Z-score -0.53), both of which are strongly to moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.71 and r=-0.46, respectively), suggesting an elevated depressive symptom burden. Furthermore, the participant reports clinically significant disturbed sleep (PSQI Z-score 1.52), a key indicator of depressive symptomatology. Objective sleep data reinforce this, showing significantly high variability in sleep start time (Z-score 1.79) and increased napping frequency (Z-score 2.40), both positively correlated with CES-D (r=0.21 for both). Variability in sleep duration is also above average (Z-score 0.73), with a positive correlation to CES-D (r=0.20). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data, such as lower interdaily stability (Z-score -0.9) and reduced amplitude (Z-score -0.67), while having low correlations with CES-D in this dataset, typically indicate physiological dysregulation often observed with mood disturbances. The relatively higher heart rate during typical sleep hours (early morning) compared to population norms for those times also suggests disrupted restorative sleep.

Conversely, evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%) is less prominent. The participant reports above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.88) and slightly above-average interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.18), both negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39 and r=-0.41, respectively). While median sleep duration is above average (Z-score 0.83), its correlation with CES-D is negligible (r=-0.01), diminishing its weight as a strong counter-indicator. Perceived stress is average (Z-score 0.1), providing little directional insight.

In a holistic assessment, the robust indicators of elevated anxiety, reduced self-esteem and happiness, and particularly the severe subjective and objective sleep disturbances (poor quality, highly irregular sleep schedule, and frequent napping) strongly outweigh the few mitigating factors. The high correlations of several key self-report measures with CES-D scores further support this interpretation. Therefore, it is most likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.

The participant presents a mixed psychological and physiological profile. Self-reported trait measures indicate a generally adaptive psychological disposition, characterized by low trait anxiety (STAI score of 38.0, Z-score -0.33) and high self-esteem (RSES score of 40.0, Z-score 0.26). These psychological strengths are notable given their strong inverse relationship with depressive symptomatology (STAI correlation with CES-D: 0.81; Self-Esteem correlation with CES-D: -0.71). Perceived stress levels are also slightly below the population mean (PSS score of 20.0, Z-score -0.44), although this correlation with CES-D is weaker (0.28). In contrast, the participant reports lower-than-average happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.46) and significantly lower interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.74, correlation -0.42). Health satisfaction is also slightly below the population mean (Z-score -0.37, correlation -0.39). Academically, the participant demonstrates consistent high performance with GPAs ranging from 3.75 to 3.85.

Sleep patterns show both strengths and areas of concern. According to Fitbit data, the participant exhibits longer-than-average median sleep duration (8 hours 11 minutes, Z-score 1.24) and slightly less variability in both sleep duration (Z-score -0.19) and sleep start times (Z-score -0.37) compared to the study population. However, the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, with a Z-score of 0.13, indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, suggesting that despite adequate sleep duration and regularity, the subjective quality of sleep is poor. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data show a robust pattern, with higher-than-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.58), amplitude (Z-score 1.11), and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81), suggesting a well-defined and regular daily physiological rhythm. The acrophase, or peak activity, is observed at 4:05 PM.

Physiological arousal, as indicated by hourly mean heart rate deviations from the mesor, reveals periods of significantly elevated activity. The participant's heart rate is notably above the population mean during specific daytime and evening hours, including 10:00-11:00 AM (Z-score 1.52), 11:00 AM-12:00 PM (Z-score 1.73), 12:00-1:00 PM (Z-score 2.19), 3:00-4:00 PM (Z-score 1.59), and 6:00-7:00 PM (Z-score 1.87), and 9:00-10:00 PM (Z-score 1.02). These elevated values, observed relative to the participant's resting heart rate of 59.0 bpm (Z-score 0.1) and a mesor of 76.93 bpm, suggest sustained periods of higher-than-average physiological activation. Conversely, heart rate deviations are significantly lower than the population mean during late night/early morning, particularly 11:00 PM-12:00 AM (Z-score -1.78), indicating a pronounced physiological trough during sleep preparation or early sleep.

Lifestyle behaviors reflect a moderately active individual who engages in less screen-based recreation but also less passive recreation. The participant reports exercising with others and playing sports 1-2 times a week, both above the population average (Z-scores 0.53 and 0.91, respectively), with weak negative correlations to CES-D. However, solo exercise is reported as lower than average (Z-score -0.43). The participant engages in less TV/video watching (Z-score -0.62), Internet usage (Z-score -0.49), reading (Z-score -0.67), and sedentary hobbies (Z-score -0.96) compared to the population mean. Notably, listening to music is reported as ""do not do,"" resulting in a significantly low Z-score of -1.19. Alcohol consumption includes wine or liquor 1-2 times a week, which is above the population average (Z-score 0.94), while beer consumption is lower (Z-score -0.41), and recreational or non-prescribed drug use is absent.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To assess whether the participant’s overall depressive symptom burden would place them in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, evidence for both elevated and relatively low symptomatology must be weighed.

Evidence for a relatively low or average CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is substantial. The participant exhibits lower trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -0.33) and exceptionally high self-esteem (RSES Z-score 0.26). Both of these measures show strong correlations with CES-D (0.81 for STAI and -0.71 for RSES), indicating that lower anxiety and higher self-esteem are highly protective against depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the participant's perceived stress is slightly below average (PSS Z-score -0.44). Behavioral patterns, such as higher engagement in social exercise and sports (Z-scores 0.53 and 0.91, respectively, with weak negative correlations to CES-D), coupled with lower recreational drug use, also align with a profile of lower depressive symptoms. Fitbit data indicates robust circadian rhythms (high amplitude, high 24-hour autocorrelation) and longer-than-average, consistent sleep duration, which generally support better mental health. Academic performance is consistently strong, which can be a resilience factor.

Conversely, evidence suggests potential for elevated depressive symptoms (top 50th percentile). The participant reports lower happiness (Z-score -0.53, moderate negative correlation with CES-D: -0.46) and significantly low interpersonal trust (Z-score -1.74, moderate negative correlation with CES-D: -0.42). Critically, the self-reported PSQI score of 7.0 indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep, a prominent feature in depressive disorders. The participant's engagement in music listening is notably low (Z-score -1.19), an activity that, while weakly correlated with CES-D (0.25), may reflect a reduced capacity for anhedonic experiences. Physiologically, multiple periods of significantly elevated heart rate deviation from the mesor during the day and evening may indicate heightened physiological arousal or stress, which could contribute to or accompany depressive symptomatology, despite lower self-reported stress.

Holistically, the strong protective factors, particularly the low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, which are core psychological attributes with very strong inverse relationships to depressive symptoms as indicated by their correlation coefficients with CES-D, outweigh the observed risk factors. While disturbed sleep, low trust, and reduced happiness are concerning, the fundamental psychological resilience suggested by the STAI and Self-Esteem scores, combined with consistent academic success and a robust physiological circadian rhythm, point towards a capacity to manage or mitigate depressive symptom burden effectively. Therefore, despite some indicators of distress, the overall profile suggests a relatively lower depressive symptom burden compared to the general student population.

28327,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a pattern of significant psychological distress, marked by elevated anxiety and stress levels, coupled with notably diminished self-esteem and general well-being. The self-reported anxiety, as measured by the STAI–Trait scale, is 58.0, corresponding to a Z-score of 1.65, classifying it as ""anxious"" relative to the study population. This high anxiety is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (r = 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem, assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, is low at 26.0 (Z-score = -1.71), which is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.70). Further reflecting this internal distress, the participant reports a current happiness score of 2.0 (Z-score = -1.61) and a health satisfaction score of 1.78 (Z-score = -1.86), both significantly below the population mean and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46 and r = -0.39, respectively). Perceived stress, indicated by a PSS score of 24.0 (Z-score = 0.65), is also elevated. Academically, the participant's GPA shows a declining trend across recent semesters (3.81 to 3.30), potentially indicating increasing academic challenges or reduced functioning.

Regarding sleep and circadian patterns, a discrepancy exists between subjective experience and objective wearable data. The participant reports clinically significant sleep disturbance via the PSQI (score = 9.0, Z-score = 1.05, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""), suggesting poor subjective sleep quality over the past month. However, Fitbit data indicates a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 37 minutes (Z-score = 0.54), which is above the study population average. Objective sleep duration and start time variability are slightly lower than average (standard deviations of 88 and 68 minutes, respectively), suggesting a degree of regularity in sleep timing, albeit with a relatively late median start time of 00:54:00. The participant also reports slightly above-average napping frequency (0.12 mean daily naps, Z-score = 0.61). Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals an Intradaily Variability (IV) of 0.69 (Z-score = 1.02), indicating higher fragmentation in daily activity patterns, potentially signifying restlessness or inconsistent routines. Conversely, Interdaily Stability (IS) is 0.49 (Z-score = 0.67), suggesting relatively consistent day-to-day rhythms, and Amplitude is 14.01 (Z-score = 1.04), which points to a robust daily heart rate rhythm. The MESOR, or mean heart rate, is slightly elevated at 76.76 bpm (Z-score = 0.38), and the acrophase (peak activity) occurs in the early evening at 5:17 PM.

Behavioral habits show some concerning trends. The participant reports above-average consumption of both beer (Z-score = 1.01) and wine or liquor (Z-score = 0.94), each consumed ""1-2 times a week,"" which could be indicative of coping behaviors. Exercise frequency is moderate, with ""1-2 times a week"" reported for exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports. However, engagement in common recreational activities is low, with ""Do not do"" reported for watching TV/videos/movies (Z-score = -1.25) and video games (Z-score = -0.56). Notably, self-reported socializing with friends is relatively low at ""31 minutes an hour"" (Z-score = -0.62). While the participant engages in listening to music for ""2-3 hours"" (Z-score = 1.13) and reading for ""15 minutes or less"" (Z-score = 0.32), the reduced social engagement and lack of participation in certain leisure activities may suggest a degree of social withdrawal or anhedonia.

Physiological arousal, as inferred from aggregated hourly heart rate data, reveals a distinctive pattern of sustained elevation. While nightly heart rates appropriately dip significantly below the mesor, there are pronounced and sustained increases in cardiovascular activity during the evening hours. Specifically, heart rate deviations from the mesor are substantially elevated from 5 PM to 9 PM, reaching a peak deviation of 24.36 bpm between 7-8 PM (Z-score = 2.24) and remaining notably high from 6-7 PM (22.95 bpm, Z-score = 1.81) and 8-9 PM (18.44 bpm, Z-score = 1.55). Even late at night, between 11 PM and 12 AM, the heart rate deviation remains positive and elevated (12.7 bpm, Z-score = 1.38), suggesting a later-than-average physiological wind-down and potentially sustained arousal or activity into the late evening. This pattern, when interpreted relative to the participant's slightly elevated resting heart rate of 60.2 bpm (Z-score = 0.24), indicates a heightened state of physiological activation during the later parts of the day.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is substantial and pervasive across self-reported psychological and well-being measures. The participant exhibits significantly elevated anxiety (STAI Z-score = 1.65, r = 0.81), severely low self-esteem (RSES Z-score = -1.71, r = -0.70), very low happiness (Z-score = -1.61, r = -0.46), and markedly low health satisfaction (Z-score = -1.86, r = -0.39). All these metrics show pronounced deviations from the population mean in the direction associated with higher depressive symptoms and are strongly or moderately correlated with the CES-D score. Additionally, subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI Z-score = 1.05), perceived stress is elevated (PSS Z-score = 0.65), and academic performance (GPA) has declined. Behavioral indicators such as reduced socializing (Z-score = -0.62) and above-average alcohol consumption could further align with depressive coping mechanisms or withdrawal. Physiologically, the high intradaily variability (Z-score = 1.02) and the sustained, pronounced evening heart rate elevations suggest heightened physiological arousal and potential difficulty with relaxation, often co-occurring with psychological distress.

Conversely, evidence supporting a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile) is limited. The participant's objective sleep duration is adequate (7 hours 37 minutes, Z-score = 0.54) and sleep timing variability is slightly lower than average, suggesting some degree of sleep regularity despite poor subjective sleep quality. Circadian rhythm metrics like interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.67) and amplitude (Z-score = 1.04) are also somewhat higher than average, indicating robust daily rhythms which might typically be protective. The participant also reports a relatively high degree of interpersonal trust (Z-score = 1.47), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.42). However, these indicators are outnumbered and outweighed by the strong, consistent evidence of significant psychological distress, low self-worth, and reduced well-being. The positive aspects of objective sleep and circadian regularity do not negate the profound subjective experience of anxiety, low mood, and poor self-esteem.

Considering the holistic evidence, the highly significant and correlated self-report measures of anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction provide compelling indications of elevated depressive symptomatology. These core psychological constructs are fundamental to depressive experience and show marked deviations consistent with high symptom burden. Therefore, it is highly probable that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden places them in the top half of the study population distribution for CES-D scores.

The participant presents a nuanced psychological profile, characterized by adaptive traits alongside some indicators of anxiety. Subjective reports reveal slightly above-average self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), happiness (Z-score 0.55), interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5), and satisfaction with physical health (Z-score 0.13), all of which are inversely correlated with depressive symptoms. Consistent with this pattern, perceived stress levels are slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.17). However, trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is slightly above the population mean (Z-score 0.17) and classified as ""anxious,"" notably exhibiting a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (0.82).

Sleep patterns, assessed through both self-report and wearable data, show a mixed picture. While the participant's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.0 technically indicates ""Disturbed Sleep,"" their relative standing within the study population (Z-score -0.33) suggests subjectively better sleep quality than the population average. Wearable data corroborates a substantial median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes, which is significantly longer than the population mean (Z-score 1.14). Conversely, there is greater variability in both nightly sleep duration (standard deviation 123 minutes, Z-score 0.51) and sleep start times (standard deviation 103 minutes, Z-score 0.43). The participant also reports a higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 0.7). These variabilities and napping frequency, while weakly correlated with CES-D, suggest potential inconsistencies in sleep scheduling despite adequate total sleep time.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active and socially engaged lifestyle. Exercise habits are notably robust, with self-reported frequencies of exercising alone, with others, and participating in sports all significantly above the population average (Z-scores ranging from 0.32 to 0.91). Socializing with friends is also a prominent activity, reported at 3-4 hours daily, placing the participant well above the mean (Z-score 1.74). These active and social engagements are generally protective factors against depressive symptoms. The participant also reports complete abstinence from substance use. While engaging in recreational screen-time activities like watching TV/videos, video games, and internet usage at higher-than-average rates (Z-scores 1.28, 1.71, and 0.85 respectively), these are balanced by high levels of physical activity and social interaction.

Physiological markers derived from wearable heart rate data indicate good cardiovascular fitness and a generally structured, albeit slightly variable, circadian rhythm. The participant exhibits a lower-than-average resting heart rate (52.5 bpm, Z-score -0.67) and a slightly lower Mesor (71.88, Z-score -0.28), both indicative of robust cardiovascular health. The heart rate circadian rhythm displays a strong amplitude (12.34, Z-score 0.5), signifying a clear distinction between peak activity and rest phases. However, Interdaily Stability (Z-score -0.33) is somewhat lower, suggesting less day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns, while Intradaily Variability (Z-score -0.95) is also notably lower, which may imply more consistent activity patterns within a day. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor reveal a typical diurnal pattern with pronounced drops during sleep hours and significant elevations during the day, particularly during the early afternoon (1-4 PM), where cardiovascular activity is markedly higher than the population average (Z-scores up to 1.82). The Acrophase, indicating the peak of physiological activity, occurs relatively late in the day at 5:17 PM.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To determine if the participant's CES-D score likely falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, evidence for both elevated and low/median depressive symptomatology must be weighed holistically against the population median CES-D of 11.5.

Evidence suggesting potentially elevated depressive symptomatology includes the participant's slightly above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.17), which carries a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.82). Additionally, while relative subjective sleep quality is better than average, the raw PSQI score of 6.0 is clinically indicative of disturbed sleep. Higher variability in sleep duration and start times, alongside increased napping, also point to some inconsistencies in sleep patterns. Elevated engagement in sedentary screen-time activities, while balanced, are weakly positively correlated with CES-D.

Conversely, a substantial body of evidence supports a lower or average depressive symptom burden. The participant demonstrates significantly higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.11), happiness (Z-score 0.55), trust (Z-score 0.5), and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.13), all of which are moderately to strongly *negatively* correlated with CES-D. Perceived stress levels are below average (Z-score -0.17), providing further protection. Behaviorally, the participant is highly physically active across multiple domains (all exercise Z-scores positive and above 0.3) and exceptionally socially engaged (Socializing with Friends Z-score 1.74), alongside complete abstinence from substance use—all robust protective factors. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate (Z-score -0.67), low Mesor (Z-score -0.28), and high circadian amplitude (Z-score 0.5) collectively suggest good physical health. Objectively, sleep duration is significantly longer than the population average (Z-score 1.14).

Considering the combined impact, the strong protective factors, such as higher self-esteem and happiness, lower perceived stress, high levels of physical activity and social engagement, and robust physiological health markers, appear to significantly outweigh the slightly elevated trait anxiety and sleep irregularities. While anxiety is a related construct, the participant's overall profile reflects considerable resilience and adaptive functioning across multiple domains, which are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Therefore, it is most probable that the participant's CES-D score would fall into the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The participant demonstrates a complex psychological and behavioral profile, characterized by notable strengths in several areas alongside specific indicators of subjective distress. Psychologically, the participant reports low trait anxiety, indicated by a STAI score of 38.0 (Z = -0.33), classifying them as ""not anxious."" This low anxiety score is particularly salient given its strong positive correlation (0.82) with CES-D scores, suggesting a protective factor against depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem is within the average range (Z = -0.03), and its strong negative correlation (-0.71) with CES-D further supports that this average level is not indicative of elevated depressive symptoms. The participant also reports slightly above-average happiness (Z = 0.55) and high, improving academic performance, culminating in a 3.94 GPA. However, in contrast to these positive indicators, the participant reports significantly poor subjective sleep quality, with a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z = 1.98), classifying their sleep as ""Disturbed."" Furthermore, satisfaction with physical health is notably below average (Z = -1.2), and this lower satisfaction moderately correlates with higher CES-D scores (-0.39). Perceived stress falls within the average range (Z = 0.1).

Objective wearable sleep data presents a discrepancy with the self-reported poor sleep quality. The participant averages a healthy 7 hours and 44 minutes of sleep (Z = 0.69), which is slightly above the population median. Crucially, there is high consistency in both nightly sleep duration (standard deviation of 64 minutes, Z = -0.84) and sleep start time (standard deviation of 52 minutes, Z = -0.68), indicating a regular sleep schedule. The absence of daily napping (Z = -0.86) also suggests consolidated nighttime sleep. This objective regularity and adequacy of sleep duration, despite the subjective experience of disturbed sleep, highlights a potential divergence between actual sleep behavior and its perceived restorative quality.

In terms of daily activities, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle, reporting significantly higher engagement in exercising with others (Z = 1.23) and participating in sports (Z = 1.58) compared to the study population. Alcohol consumption (beer, wine, or liquor) is slightly elevated, reported as ""1-2 times a week"" (Z-scores around 1.0), but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use is reported. Daily recreational habits indicate above-average time spent watching TV/videos/movies (Z = 1.28) and below-average time socializing with friends (Z = -0.62) and listening to music (Z = -0.72). While correlations between most daily habits and CES-D are weak, the high level of physical activity is generally recognized as a protective factor for mental well-being.

Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythms reveals a robust and well-regulated physiological pattern. The participant exhibits above-average interdaily stability (Z = 1.0) and notably low intradaily variability (Z = -1.73), indicative of a highly regular and less fragmented daily physiological rhythm. The circadian amplitude is high (Z = 1.39), signifying a pronounced variation between peak and trough heart rates, which is typically a healthy marker of physiological adaptability. The acrophase, or peak activity period, is consistently observed at 5:55 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor confirm this pattern, with the lowest rates occurring during early morning (e.g., -23.25 bpm at 6-7 AM) and significantly elevated rates during the late afternoon and early evening (e.g., 26.09 bpm at 5-6 PM, Z = 2.27; 22.76 bpm at 6-7 PM, Z = 1.78). These marked evening peaks align with the participant's self-reported high levels of physical activity and sports engagement. The overall mesor (average heart rate) is slightly elevated (Z = 0.58), but the resting heart rate is average (Z = -0.04), consistent with good cardiovascular health.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

A holistic assessment of the participant's data presents a mixed profile regarding depressive symptom burden. There is substantial evidence pointing towards a CES-D score in the **bottom 50%** of the study population. This includes low trait anxiety (Z = -0.33, with a strong positive correlation of 0.82 to CES-D), average self-esteem (Z = -0.03, with a strong negative correlation of -0.71 to CES-D), above-average happiness, consistent and sufficient objective sleep duration, high academic performance, and significantly high engagement in physical exercise and sports. Furthermore, the physiological data reveals a remarkably robust and stable circadian rhythm with high amplitude and low intradaily variability, which are generally associated with better mental health outcomes. The participant's perceived stress is also within the average range.

However, there is also notable evidence that suggests a CES-D score in the **top 50%**. The most salient feature is the significantly disturbed subjective sleep quality, indicated by a PSQI score of 11.0 (Z = 1.98). This Z-score represents one of the most extreme deviations in the dataset, indicating that the participant perceives their sleep as severely problematic, a symptom frequently associated with depressive states. This subjective experience carries significant weight even when objective sleep duration and regularity appear healthy. Additionally, the participant reports significantly below-average satisfaction with physical health (Z = -1.2), which moderately correlates with higher CES-D scores (-0.39). These two subjective measures of distress—poor sleep quality and low health satisfaction—are strong indicators of a higher symptom burden.

Considering the strong protective factors from the STAI and Self-Esteem scores, which correlate strongly with lower CES-D, against the significant subjective distress from the PSQI and Health Satisfaction scores, it becomes a balancing act. However, the magnitude of the PSQI Z-score (nearly 2 standard deviations above the mean) is a critical indicator of considerable subjective suffering. While the participant's overall lifestyle and physiological regulation are largely positive, the severe subjective disturbance in sleep and lower satisfaction with health are direct reflections of perceived well-being, which are central to depressive symptomatology. Therefore, despite the many strengths, the profound level of subjective distress related to sleep and health is likely to elevate the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, placing their CES-D score in the top half of the study population.

The participant demonstrates a complex interplay of psychological traits, lifestyle habits, and physiological markers, presenting a mixed picture regarding their overall well-being and potential depressive symptom burden. Psychologically, there is evidence of lower self-esteem (Z-score -0.87), with a strong negative correlation to CES-D scores (-0.71), suggesting this trait may contribute to increased depressive symptomatology. Self-reported happiness is also below average (Z-score -0.53) and negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), further indicating a potential predisposition to depressive feelings. Perceived health satisfaction is notably low (Z-score -0.78), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (-0.39), which may reflect a general dissatisfaction that could extend to mental health. While the participant's trait anxiety (STAI score 40.0, Z-score -0.13) is near the population average, it is classified as ""anxious,"" and the strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81) implies that even average anxiety levels in this individual may be linked to depressive symptoms. Stress levels, as measured by the PSS (Z-score 0.1), are average and have only a weak positive correlation with CES-D, indicating that perceived stress may not be a primary driver of depressive symptoms in this case. Academic performance, as reflected by recent GPAs (3.35-3.72), appears to be consistently strong.

Behaviorally, the participant reports minimal engagement in substance use across all categories, with significantly negative Z-scores, indicating a lifestyle that avoids these potential risk factors for mental health issues. Exercise habits are somewhat mixed, with below-average solitary exercise and no participation in sports, but above-average frequency of exercising with others (Z-score 0.53). This social component of exercise could offer some protective benefits. Daily recreation habits reveal a notable absence of engagement in passive media like watching TV/videos/movies, video games, or reading, and a general avoidance of sedentary hobbies. However, internet usage is higher than average (Z-score 0.85), which, depending on its nature, could either be a productive outlet or a source of increased screen time. Socializing with friends is reported at an average level (Z-score 0.16).

Physiological data, particularly from wearable metrics, reveals distinct patterns. The participant exhibits robust indicators of cardiovascular fitness and strong circadian rhythmicity. Resting heart rate (48.25 bpm, Z-score -1.18) and MESOR (64.89 bpm, Z-score -1.24) are both significantly lower than the population average, suggesting excellent cardiovascular health. Circadian rhythm metrics show above-average interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81), indicating highly regular and well-structured daily physiological rhythms. The hourly heart rate deviation from the MESOR further supports this, displaying a pronounced diurnal pattern with significant drops during typical sleep hours (e.g., -26.54 bpm at 4-5 AM, Z-score -1.4) and clear, elevated peaks during active daytime and evening periods (e.g., 18.53 bpm at 12-1 PM, Z-score 1.61; 23.88 bpm at 7-8 PM, Z-score 2.16). This robust physiological regulation might generally confer resilience against mental health challenges.

However, despite these strong physiological rhythms, sleep patterns appear significantly disturbed, as evidenced by both self-report and wearable data. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) classifies the participant as having ""Disturbed Sleep."" This is corroborated by Fitbit data, which shows shorter than average median sleep duration (6 hours 28 minutes, Z-score -0.88), suggesting insufficient sleep. Furthermore, there is higher than average variability in both sleep duration (120 minutes SD, Z-score 0.43) and sleep start times (103 minutes SD, Z-score 0.43), pointing to inconsistent sleep schedules. The significantly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score 1.21) could indicate compensatory napping due to poor nighttime sleep, a common feature in individuals experiencing sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms. These pervasive sleep issues, strongly linked to mental well-being, introduce a significant counterpoint to the otherwise robust physiological rhythmicity.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated depressive symptom burden comes from the self-reported psychological measures and the comprehensive sleep data. The participant's self-esteem is significantly lower than the study population (Z-score -0.87), and given its strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), this directly suggests higher depressive symptoms. Similarly, lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z-score -0.78), both moderately negatively correlated with CES-D, further point to increased depressive burden. Critically, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 9.0 (Z-score 1.05) indicates clinically significant sleep disturbance, a cardinal symptom and risk factor for depression. This is powerfully reinforced by the Fitbit-derived sleep statistics: shorter median sleep duration (Z-score -0.88), coupled with higher variability in both sleep duration (Z-score 0.43) and sleep start times (Z-score 0.43), signify inconsistent and inadequate sleep. The above-average frequency of napping (Z-score 1.21) also suggests a struggle to achieve restorative sleep. The confluence of low self-esteem, reduced happiness and health satisfaction, and pervasive, objectively measured sleep disturbances strongly supports a higher CES-D score.

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
Conversely, several factors suggest a potentially lower depressive symptom burden. The participant's physiological health markers are remarkably strong: significantly lower resting heart rate (Z-score -1.18) and MESOR (Z-score -1.24) indicate excellent cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm derived from heart rate data is highly stable and regular, with above-average Interdaily Stability (Z-score 0.67) and 24-hour Autocorrelation (Z-score 0.81), alongside a robust diurnal heart rate pattern. These objective physiological rhythms suggest good internal regulation which is often protective against mood disorders. Furthermore, the participant reports very low substance usage across all categories (significant negative Z-scores) and generally low engagement in passive and sedentary recreational activities, which are typically associated with better mental health outcomes. Academic performance (GPA) is consistently strong. The participant's STAI score is near average (Z-score -0.13), and while classified as ""anxious,"" its slight deviation below the mean, combined with a strong positive correlation with CES-D, would theoretically suggest a slightly lower CES-D score based on this single measure.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When integrating the multimodal data, the evidence for elevated depressive symptoms, primarily stemming from self-reported psychological distress and corroborated by significant sleep disturbances across both subjective and objective measures, appears to outweigh the robust physiological health and rhythmic stability. While the participant exhibits strong cardiovascular fitness and well-regulated daily physiological rhythms, which are generally protective, the profound and multifaceted sleep problems (poor quality, short duration, high variability, increased napping) are highly indicative of depressive processes. These sleep issues, combined with significantly lower self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction, paint a consistent picture of psychological distress relevant to depressive symptomatology. The median CES-D score for the study population is 11.0. Given the strong, consistent indicators of disturbed sleep and negative self-perceptions, it is more likely that these factors contribute to a CES-D score placing the participant in the top half of the distribution.

56543,18.0,0.7461139896373057,"### Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis

The participant exhibits a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress, particularly in areas highly correlated with depressive symptoms, alongside objective physiological markers indicative of elevated arousal and disturbed sleep. Self-report measures highlight considerable anxiety (STAI score 50, Z-score 0.86), placing the participant in an ""anxious"" classification within the study population, a factor strongly correlated with higher CES-D scores (0.81). This is compounded by notably low self-esteem (RSES score 33, Z-score -0.73), which also shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is reported as below average (score 3, Z-score -0.53) and moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46), further suggesting a lower mood state. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS score 25, Z-score 0.92), consistent with a pattern of general psychological strain, though its correlation with CES-D is weaker (0.28). While the participant reports higher-than-average satisfaction with physical health (score 5.44, Z-score 0.88), this positive indicator is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting that even with good health satisfaction, other psychological factors may be predominant.

Sleep patterns reveal significant disturbances, as indicated by a PSQI score of 9, classifying the participant with ""Disturbed Sleep"" and placing them well above the average (Z-score 1.05) for sleep difficulties. Objectively, median sleep duration is somewhat shorter than the population average (6 hours 26 minutes, Z-score -0.94), but the standard deviation of sleep duration (71 minutes, Z-score -0.67) and sleep start time (60 minutes, Z-score -0.50) suggest moderate consistency in sleep timing and duration across nights. The lack of correlation between these objective sleep metrics and CES-D, despite the subjective disturbance, suggests that while sleep is poor, its variability in duration/timing may not be the primary driver of depressive symptoms in this individual. Napping is minimal and close to the population mean (0.1 naps/day, Z-score 0.31).

Physiological data from wearable devices indicate a relatively elevated baseline cardiovascular activity. The participant's resting heart rate (68.0 bpm, Z-score 1.17) and MESOR (82.27 bpm, Z-score 1.14) are both above the study population average, with weak positive correlations to CES-D (0.19 for both). This suggests a higher overall physiological arousal. Circadian rhythm metrics, including interdaily stability (0.49, Z-score 0.67) and intraday variability (0.59, Z-score 0.32), are close to or slightly above average, suggesting a relatively stable but potentially fragmented daily activity rhythm. The acrophase, or peak heart rate, occurs relatively late in the day at 6:44 PM. More strikingly, the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the MESOR reveal pronounced physiological arousal during the late evening. Specifically, heart rates between 9-10 PM and 10-11 PM show extreme positive deviations (26.75, Z-score 3.28; and 44.16, Z-score 5.94, respectively). These substantially elevated heart rates during hours when individuals typically wind down suggest significant physiological activation or a delayed circadian rhythm, which could contribute to difficulties in sleep onset and overall distress, aligning with the reported disturbed sleep.

Behaviorally, the participant reports refraining from all listed substance use (Z-scores ranging from -0.11 to -1.30), indicating a health-conscious approach in this domain. Exercise habits are mixed, with frequent solitary exercise (""Three times a week or more"", Z-score 1.07) but infrequent social exercise or sports. Regular exercise can be a protective factor, though its correlation with CES-D is negligible in this dataset (-0.09). Daily recreation habits indicate very high engagement in reading (2-3 hours, Z-score 4.24) and extensive internet usage (""more than 4 hours"", Z-score 2.19). While reading is a positive cognitive activity, the high internet usage, with a weak positive correlation to CES-D (0.25), could potentially be a coping mechanism or contribute to sedentary behavior that is not beneficial. Socializing with friends is reported at an average level (1-2 hours, Z-score 0.16). Interpersonal trust is close to the population average (score 3.17, Z-score -0.14), with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D (-0.41), implying that lower trust tends to be associated with higher depressive symptoms, thus average trust here might offer some minor protective effect.

### Overall Ranking of CES-D Score

To assess whether the participant's CES-D score falls into the top or bottom half of the study population distribution, we consider the cumulative evidence. The population's 50th percentile for CES-D is 11.0.

**Evidence for a High CES-D Score (Top 50%):**
The most compelling evidence for an elevated CES-D score comes from several self-reported psychological measures and physiological markers. The participant exhibits high levels of anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.86, strong positive correlation 0.81 with CES-D), significantly low self-esteem (RSES Z-score -0.73, strong negative correlation -0.71 with CES-D), and disturbed sleep (PSQI score 9, Z-score 1.05). Additionally, self-reported happiness is below average (Z-score -0.53, moderate negative correlation -0.46 with CES-D), and perceived stress is above average (Z-score 0.92). Physiologically, both resting heart rate (Z-score 1.17) and MESOR (Z-score 1.14) are elevated, each showing a weak positive correlation with CES-D. Critically, there are extreme hourly heart rate deviations, particularly in the late evening (9-11 PM, Z-scores 3.28 and 5.94), indicating significant physiological arousal during typical winding-down hours, which strongly aligns with disturbed sleep and general distress often associated with higher depressive symptoms. High internet usage (Z-score 2.19) also shows a weak positive correlation with CES-D (0.25).

**Evidence for a Low/Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%):**
Evidence supporting a lower or median CES-D score is less pronounced. The participant reports above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.88), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39), suggesting it might be a protective factor. They also engage in frequent solitary exercise (Z-score 1.07) and abstain from substance use. While these are generally healthy behaviors, their direct correlations with CES-D in this dataset are either negligible or not strong enough to counteract the significant indicators of distress. Interpersonal trust is near average (Z-score -0.14), and given its moderate negative correlation with CES-D (-0.41), this average trust level would slightly lean against a high CES-D score, but its Z-score is not far from the mean.

**Holistic Analysis:**
The overall pattern strongly points towards a CES-D score in the top 50% of the study population. The prominent indicators of psychological distress (high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, high stress, disturbed sleep) are significantly correlated with CES-D and represent substantial deviations from the population mean. These psychological factors are further supported by objective physiological evidence of heightened arousal, particularly in the late evening, which likely contributes to the reported sleep disturbances. While some positive health behaviors are present (health satisfaction, exercise, no substance use), their influence is outweighed by the robust and interconnected evidence of psychological and physiological dysregulation that are characteristic features of elevated depressive symptomatology. The combination of strong subjective distress and objective physiological disruption, particularly the extreme evening heart rate elevation, suggests a significant burden of depressive symptoms placing the participant in the higher half of the distribution.

{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
89142,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents with a complex profile, exhibiting a mix of psychological resilience and areas of potential concern. Subjectively, the participant reports an extremely low level of perceived stress, with a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 0.0, placing them more than five standard deviations below the population mean (Z-score = -5.88). Similarly, their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 4.0 (Z-score = -1.26) indicates subjectively good sleep quality, categorizing them as a ""Good Sleep"" responder. These factors typically correlate with lower depressive symptom burden. However, these positive subjective reports are contrasted by other self-reported psychological metrics. The participant exhibits below-average self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score 32.0, Z-score = -0.87), below-average current happiness (Z-score = -0.53), and elevated trait anxiety (STAI score 48.0, Z-score = 0.66, classified as anxious). Most notably, the participant reports extremely low satisfaction with their physical health (score 1.0, Z-score = -2.45), which is a significant deviation from the population mean and typically correlates negatively with depressive symptoms. The participant also reports slightly below-average interpersonal trust (Z-score = -0.46). Academically, a declining trend in GPA across recent semesters (from 3.73 to 3.33) might suggest increasing academic challenges.

Objective sleep data from wearable metrics reveals a significant discrepancy with subjective reports. The participant's median sleep duration is 5 hours and 50 minutes, which is substantially below the population average (Z-score = -1.68). This objectively short sleep duration, coupled with a slightly higher standard deviation in sleep duration (Z-score = 0.51), indicates somewhat inconsistent and insufficient nocturnal sleep. The median sleep start time is late, at 01:01:59, though the variability in sleep start time is average (Z-score = -0.49). The participant also reports slightly above-average napping (Z-score = 0.7), which may serve as a compensatory mechanism for inadequate nighttime sleep.

Physiological data derived from heart rate exhibits a generally stable and robust circadian rhythm, despite the reported short sleep duration. The participant's overall heart rate (Mesor = 60.11 bpm, Z-score = -1.89) and resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z-score = -1.49) are both significantly lower than the study population mean, suggesting good underlying cardiovascular fitness. The circadian rhythm metrics, including interdaily stability (Z-score = 0.33), intradaily variability (Z-score = -0.74), and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score = 0.14), are within or slightly healthier than average ranges, indicating a regular and well-structured physiological pattern. Hourly heart rate deviations from the Mesor show a clear and pronounced diurnal pattern, with deeply suppressed heart rates during the early morning hours (e.g., -24.83 bpm at 4-5 AM) indicative of physiological rest, followed by a rapid rise in activity in the morning (e.g., +4.43 bpm at 7-8 AM, Z-score = 1.81), and sustained elevated activity throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon (Acrophase at 3:57 PM) before gradually declining in the evening. This indicates a well-regulated physiological arousal system with appropriate daily fluctuations.

Behavioral habits further contextualize the participant's profile. They report no usage of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with correspondingly low Z-scores, indicating a potentially healthier approach to substance use. However, the participant reports no engagement in any form of exercise, whether alone or with others (Z-scores for both are significantly negative, e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score = -1.93). Lack of physical activity is a common risk factor for depressive symptoms. In terms of daily recreation, the participant dedicates significant time to reading (Z-score = 2.28) and video games (Z-score = 1.71), while spending below-average time socializing with friends (Z-score = -0.62) and on internet usage. These patterns suggest a preference for solitary, sedentary activities over social engagement or physical activity.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50%)**:
The strongest evidence for a low or median CES-D score comes from the participant's exceptionally low perceived stress (PSS Z-score = -5.88), which is a significant protective factor. Furthermore, the participant reports subjectively good sleep quality (PSQI Z-score = -1.26). Physiologically, their significantly low Mesor (Z-score = -1.89) and resting heart rate (Z-score = -1.49), coupled with a well-structured circadian rhythm, indicate good cardiovascular health, which is generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden. The absence of substance use also points towards a healthier lifestyle in that domain.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50%)**:
Conversely, substantial evidence points towards an elevated depressive symptom burden. The most salient factors include the participant's *very low satisfaction with physical health* (Z-score = -2.45), which strongly correlates with higher CES-D scores. Objectively, the participant's *median sleep duration is significantly short* (Z-score = -1.68), a well-established risk factor for depression, despite their subjective perception of good sleep. Psychologically, the participant exhibits below-average self-esteem (Z-score = -0.87), below-average happiness (Z-score = -0.53), and above-average trait anxiety (Z-score = 0.66), all of which are positively correlated with higher depressive symptoms. Behaviorally, the *complete lack of exercise* (e.g., Exercised Alone Z-score = -1.93) is a significant risk factor. The declining GPA also suggests potential academic or personal difficulties.

**Holistic Analysis**:
While the participant reports unusually low perceived stress and good subjective sleep quality, these positive indicators are significantly counterbalanced by a cluster of strong risk factors. The profound discrepancy between self-reported ""good sleep"" and objectively measured *very short sleep duration* is a critical consideration, as chronic sleep deprivation can underpin various psychological difficulties regardless of subjective awareness. The participant's extremely low health satisfaction, below-average self-esteem and happiness, elevated trait anxiety, and complete absence of exercise collectively represent a substantial burden of psychological and behavioral risk factors commonly associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Given the strength and prevalence of these indicators, particularly the objective sleep deficit, very low health satisfaction, and lack of engagement in a key protective behavior like exercise, it is more likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden places them in the top half of the study population distribution.

24898,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a multifaceted psychological and behavioral profile with notable strengths in physiological regulation and active lifestyle, yet also significant self-reported psychological vulnerabilities. In terms of self-reported psychological traits, the participant reported above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 0.37) and above-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 0.65), both of which are positively correlated with depressive symptoms. A salient finding is the significantly below-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score: -1.01), a factor strongly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Similarly, interpersonal trust was reported as significantly below the population average (Z-score: -1.1). However, counterbalancing these, the participant also reported above-average happiness (Z-score: 0.55) and higher satisfaction with physical health (Z-score: 0.88). Objectively, the participant maintains strong academic performance with a consistent high GPA.

Behaviorally, the participant demonstrates high engagement in physical activity, reporting exercising alone, exercising with others, and playing sports ""three times a week or more,"" with corresponding high positive Z-scores (1.07, 1.23, 1.58 respectively). Recreational habits include extensive reading (Z-score: 2.28) and listening to music (Z-score: 2.06), and above-average socializing with friends (Z-score: 0.95), while reporting very low engagement in activities like watching TV/videos/movies and internet usage (Z-scores: -1.25 and -1.16). Substance usage across all categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational, non-prescribed drugs) is reported as low or non-existent, falling below the population average. This profile suggests a highly active and engaged individual, favoring enriching and social activities over more passive or sedentary forms of recreation.

Sleep patterns reveal a disparity between objective consistency and subjective experience. Objectively, the participant exhibits a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 14 minutes, which is significantly below the population average (Z-score: -1.18). Despite this short duration, sleep patterns are highly consistent, with below-average standard deviations for both sleep duration (Z-score: -0.88) and sleep start time (Z-score: -1.07), indicating a regular sleep schedule. The median sleep start time is close to 1:00 AM, and napping is absent. Subjectively, however, the participant reported a PSQI score of 6, which suggests clinically significant sleep disturbance, even though this score is slightly below the population mean (Z-score: -0.33) in this specific cohort.

Physiologically, the participant demonstrates highly regular and robust circadian rhythms, as evidenced by very high interdaily stability (Z-score: 1.99), low intradaily variability (Z-score: -1.45), and high circadian amplitude (Z-score: 1.64) derived from heart rate data. The resting heart rate is notably low (49.4 bpm, Z-score: -1.04), indicating good cardiovascular fitness. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a clear and pronounced diurnal pattern, with significant dips during late night/early morning hours (e.g., -31.54 bpm at 4-5 AM, Z-score: -2.22) and substantial elevations during waking hours, peaking in the afternoon and early evening (e.g., 21.24 bpm at 2-3 PM, Z-score: 2.62; 24.94 bpm at 6-7 PM, Z-score: 2.15). The acrophase is observed at 4:05 PM, aligning with these peak activity periods. This combination of strong circadian regularity, robust amplitude, and low resting heart rate suggests a well-regulated physiological system, which is generally considered protective for overall health and well-being.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence supporting a higher CES-D score (top 50% of the study population) includes several self-reported psychological factors with strong correlations to CES-D. The participant reported above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z-score 0.37; correlation 0.81) and significantly below-average self-esteem (RSES Z-score -1.01; correlation -0.71), both of which are highly predictive of elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, above-average perceived stress (PSS Z-score 0.65; correlation 0.28), below-average interpersonal trust (Trust Z-score -1.1; correlation -0.41), and an objectively short median sleep duration (Z-score -1.18) are all factors associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Subjectively, a PSQI score of 6 indicates disturbed sleep, which is often a component of depressive symptomatology.

Conversely, evidence for a lower or median CES-D score (bottom 50%) is robust in behavioral and physiological domains. The participant demonstrates exceptional circadian rhythm stability and amplitude (Interdaily Stability Z-score 1.99, Amplitude Z-score 1.64), and a low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.04), all indicators of strong physiological health, though their correlations with CES-D in this population are weak. Behaviorally, the participant reports high engagement in physical activity, sports, and enriching recreational activities such as reading, listening to music, and socializing, which are generally considered protective against depressive symptoms. Self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55; correlation -0.46) and health satisfaction (Z-score 0.88; correlation -0.39) are also above average and negatively correlated with CES-D. Objective sleep consistency, both in duration and start time, is notably high, which can be a resilience factor despite the short duration.

Holistically, the strong correlations between CES-D and the participant's self-reported psychological vulnerabilities (anxiety, self-esteem, stress, trust) suggest a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. While the physiological and behavioral health markers are impressive and generally protective, their weak correlations with CES-D in this study population indicate they may not significantly mitigate the specific depressive symptom burden measured by the CES-D to the same extent as the strongly correlated psychological factors. The combination of significantly low self-esteem, elevated anxiety, above-average stress, low trust, and objectively short sleep duration points towards an overall symptom burden that would place the participant in the upper half of the distribution.

74413,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a psychological profile characterized by notable strengths in anxiety and self-esteem measures. Their STAI-Trait score is significantly below the population mean (Z-score -1.02), classifying them as ""not anxious,"" a trait strongly negatively associated with depressive symptoms (correlation with CES-D: 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is notably high (Z-score 1.1), which is also robustly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Perceived stress is also low (Z-score -0.98, correlation with CES-D: 0.28). Academic performance appears strong, with a Fall 2016 GPA of 3.7. Lifestyle behaviors reflect active engagement in solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z-score 1.07) and substantial reading (16-30 minutes daily, Z-score 1.3), contrasting with minimal engagement in screen-based recreational activities. Furthermore, substance use is reported as ""Not at all"" across all categories. However, areas of moderate concern include lower-than-average interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46, correlation with CES-D: -0.41), lower self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation with CES-D: -0.46), and significantly lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.2, correlation with CES-D: -0.4).

Sleep patterns present a mixed but largely consistent picture. While the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) categorizes the participant's sleep as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" their PSQI Z-score of -0.33 indicates that their subjective sleep disturbance is actually slightly *below* the population average. Fitbit-derived sleep metrics provide a more objective perspective, showing an average sleep duration of 7 hours and 34 minutes, which is slightly above the population median (Z-score 0.47). Crucially, both sleep duration variability (standard deviation 42 minutes, Z-score -1.34) and sleep start time variability (standard deviation 67 minutes, Z-score -0.35) are notably low, suggesting highly consistent and regular sleep habits. Circadian rhythm analysis from heart rate data indicates average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z-score -0.11), reflecting typical overall daily rhythmicity. However, intradaily variability (IV) is significantly elevated (Z-score 1.51), pointing to more fragmented activity/rest patterns within each day. Despite common associations of high IV with dysregulated rhythms, its correlation with CES-D in this specific dataset is negligible (-0.05). The participant's resting heart rate is slightly below average (Z-score -0.33), which may indicate good cardiovascular fitness.

Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals distinct patterns of physiological arousal. Heart rate consistently drops to its lowest points in the early morning hours (e.g., -22.99 from mesor at 5-6 am, Z-score -0.67), aligning with typical sleep physiology. However, there are notable periods of elevated heart rate, particularly in the late afternoon (3-4 pm: 16.58 above mesor, Z-score 1.38) and, more strikingly, in the late evening and early night hours. Significant heart rate elevations are observed from 10-11 pm (22.05 above mesor, Z-score 2.46) and 12-1 am (7.42 above mesor, Z-score 1.32). These pronounced elevations indicate periods of sustained physiological arousal or heightened activity during times when many individuals might be transitioning to rest. While the specific nature of this late-night physiological activity cannot be definitively determined from the data, it represents a substantial deviation from typical population heart rate patterns for those hours, suggesting a potentially active or physiologically demanding late-night routine.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for Low or Median CES-D Score (Bottom 50th percentile):**
The strongest evidence supporting a lower overall depressive symptom burden for this participant stems from several self-reported psychological traits that exhibit high correlations with the CES-D score in the study population. Specifically, the participant's STAI-Trait score, indicative of low anxiety (Z-score -1.02), has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81). Similarly, their high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71). Additionally, lower perceived stress (Z-score -0.98) moderately supports a lower CES-D score (correlation 0.28). Complementing these psychological indicators, Fitbit-derived sleep data shows above-average sleep duration and remarkably consistent sleep duration and start times (Z-scores of -1.34 and -0.35 for standard deviations, respectively). Such robust sleep hygiene is generally considered protective against depressive symptoms. While self-reported sleep quality (PSQI) is classified as ""Disturbed Sleep,"" the participant's PSQI Z-score (-0.33) indicates that their subjective sleep disturbance is actually less than the average student in the study population.

**Evidence for High CES-D Score (Top 50th percentile):**
Some self-reported measures suggest areas of potential vulnerability that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Lower-than-average scores on self-reported happiness (Z-score -0.53, correlation -0.46), interpersonal trust (Z-score -0.46, correlation -0.41), and particularly low satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -1.2, correlation -0.4) are moderately associated with higher CES-D scores. Furthermore, wearable data indicates a significantly elevated intradaily variability (IV) in heart rate (Z-score 1.51), which typically reflects fragmented activity/rest patterns. While high IV is often considered a marker of dysregulated circadian rhythms, it is critical to note that the correlation between IV and CES-D in this specific dataset is negligible (-0.05), significantly mitigating its interpretative weight for predicting elevated CES-D in this context. The observed significant physiological arousal in the late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 10-11 pm HR deviation Z-score 2.46) signifies an atypical activity pattern or physiological state that *could* contribute to sleep disruption or stress, but its direct correlation with CES-D is not established through the provided data.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
Considering all available evidence, the strong and consistent indicators from the participant's self-reported psychological traits—specifically low anxiety, high self-esteem, and low perceived stress—are highly influential. These measures exhibit high magnitude Z-scores and strong correlations with CES-D, suggesting a significantly lower depressive symptom burden. While some self-reported areas (happiness, trust, health satisfaction) present minor counter-indicators, their Z-scores are less extreme, and their correlations with CES-D are not as strong as those observed for anxiety and self-esteem. Furthermore, despite the PSQI's ""Disturbed Sleep"" classification, the participant's relative position within the study population (Z-score -0.33) and the objective consistency of their Fitbit-derived sleep patterns argue against severe sleep problems contributing substantially to depressive symptoms. Critically, the high intradaily variability, which might otherwise be a significant concern, holds negligible predictive value for CES-D in this particular dataset due to its low correlation. Therefore, the preponderance of strong, direct evidence, particularly from the highly correlated psychological measures, strongly suggests that this participant's overall depressive symptom burden falls into the lower half of the study population distribution.

77789,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a complex profile of psychological traits, lifestyle behaviors, and physiological patterns. Self-reported data indicate a slightly elevated level of trait anxiety (STAI score 43.0, Z-score 0.17), which is notably positively correlated with CES-D scores (0.81), suggesting a predisposition to emotional distress. Concurrently, self-esteem is slightly below the population average (score 36.0, Z-score -0.31) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71), further pointing towards an elevated risk for depressive symptomatology. Subjective sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, is 6.0, classifying it as disturbed sleep despite being slightly better than the population mean (Z-score -0.33). This absolute score suggests significant sleep difficulties. Furthermore, the participant reports lower overall satisfaction with physical health (score 3.11, Z-score -0.86), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39). In contrast, the participant reports slightly higher happiness (Z-score 0.55) and higher interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D, suggesting protective factors against depression. Perceived stress levels are slightly below average (Z-score -0.44) and weakly positively correlated with CES-D.

Behaviorally, the participant shows reduced engagement in social physical activity, specifically exercising with others (frequency ""Not at all"", Z-score -1.58), a pattern negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23). Participation in sports is also notably low (Z-score -1.09). While solitary exercise is infrequent (Z-score -0.43), the participant engages in reading more than the average student (Z-score 1.3). Engagement in many screen-based recreational activities (watching TV/videos, video games, internet usage, listening to music) is below the population average (Z-scores ranging from -0.56 to -1.25), and notably, these are positively correlated with CES-D, suggesting that lower engagement in these specific activities might be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Substance usage is generally low or average.

Objective sleep data from the wearable device indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 32 minutes, which is below the population average (Z-score -0.8) and is generally considered short. More critically, the standard deviation of sleep duration is notably high (166 minutes, Z-score 1.49), reflecting significant irregularity in nightly sleep patterns, a feature positively correlated with CES-D (0.19). While sleep start time variability is near the population average (Z-score -0.45), the combination of short and highly variable sleep duration, alongside subjective sleep disturbance, points towards a compromised sleep profile.

Cardiovascular data reveal several significant patterns. The participant's resting heart rate (68.7 bpm, Z-score 1.25) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 83.16, Z-score 1.26) are both notably elevated compared to the study population, and both are positively correlated with CES-D (0.19). This suggests a state of elevated chronic physiological arousal. Furthermore, the amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm is considerably lower than the population average (7.73, Z-score -0.99), indicating a blunted physiological response to the daily cycle and reduced variation in heart rate throughout the day. This reduced amplitude is negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.1). Interdaily stability (Z-score 0.67) is slightly higher than average, and intradaily variability (Z-score -0.39) is slightly lower than average, indicating some regularity in the overall 24-hour heart rate rhythm but potentially reduced physiological flexibility. The acrophase, or peak activity time, occurs relatively late in the day at 4:00 PM. Hourly heart rate deviations show a typical daily pattern, with the lowest rates during early morning sleep hours (e.g., -17.69 bpm at 5-6am) and peaks during morning and early afternoon activity (e.g., 12.29 bpm at 8-9am). The Z-scores for these hourly deviations are mostly within a typical range, though the peak at 8-9am is notably high (Z-score 1.71), suggesting a sharp increase in activity or arousal in the morning, followed by a somewhat reduced relative heart rate response in the late afternoon/early evening compared to the population average.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

To determine if the participant's CES-D score likely falls in the top or bottom half of the study population (50th percentile at 11.0), a holistic assessment of the evidence is required.

Evidence suggesting a **higher CES-D score (top 50%)** includes:
*   Slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z=0.17), which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81).
*   Slightly lower self-esteem (RSES Z=-0.31), which has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71).
*   Subjective disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 6.0), a known symptom of depression.
*   Lower health satisfaction (Z=-0.86), negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.39).
*   Significantly reduced social exercise (Z=-1.58), negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.23).
*   Short median sleep duration (6 hours 32 minutes, Z=-0.8).
*   High variability in sleep duration (Z=1.49), positively correlated with CES-D (0.19).
*   Elevated resting heart rate (Z=1.25) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z=1.26), both positively correlated with CES-D (0.19).
*   Reduced amplitude of the heart rate circadian rhythm (Z=-0.99), negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.1).

Evidence suggesting a **lower or median CES-D score (bottom 50%)** includes:
*   Slightly higher happiness (Z=0.55), negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.46).
*   Slightly lower perceived stress (Z=-0.44), weakly positively correlated with CES-D (0.28).
*   Higher interpersonal trust (Z=0.83), negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.41).
*   Slightly better subjective sleep quality *relative to the population* (PSQI Z=-0.33), though the absolute score is still indicative of disturbance.
*   Reduced engagement in several screen-based recreational activities (e.g., TV/videos, internet, music; Z-scores mostly negative), which are positively correlated with CES-D, implying lower CES-D for reduced engagement.
*   Lower alcohol consumption (beer Z=-0.41, wine/liquor Z=0.19, but overall low).

When weighing these factors, the consistently elevated physiological markers (Resting HR, Mesor, reduced Amplitude) and the significant self-reported indicators of psychological distress (Anxiety, Self-Esteem, Health Satisfaction) present a compelling picture. The short and highly variable sleep duration, combined with subjective sleep disturbance, also strongly points to increased depressive symptoms. While the participant reports higher happiness and trust, and lower perceived stress, these are overshadowed by the strong correlations and magnitude of the more direct indicators of depressive risk and physiological dysregulation. The cumulative evidence from both self-report and objective wearable data strongly suggests a higher burden of depressive symptoms.

88882,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant presents a psychological profile characterized by notable resilience and well-being across several self-report measures. Trait anxiety, as measured by the STAI, is exceptionally low (Z-score -1.31), classified as ""not anxious,"" a finding strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (correlation 0.81, indicating that lower anxiety correlates with lower CES-D). This is complemented by high self-esteem (Z-Score 1.1) and elevated self-reported happiness (Z-Score 1.64), both of which are moderately to strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (-0.71 and -0.46, respectively). Perceived stress is also significantly below average (Z-Score -0.98), and health satisfaction is above average (Z-score 0.55), with both showing correlations consistent with lower depressive symptoms. Academic performance is consistently excellent, indicated by a near-perfect GPA across semesters, further suggesting high functional capacity. Lifestyle behaviors include above-average engagement in exercise, both alone and with others, which generally aligns with better mental health outcomes, and below-average engagement in most sedentary recreational activities and screen time. Substance use is generally moderate to low. These combined self-report and behavioral patterns largely suggest a psychological state inconsistent with elevated depressive symptoms.

In contrast to the robust positive self-reported well-being, objective wearable data reveals significant and consistent sleep characteristics that warrant attention. The participant's median sleep duration is notably short at 5 hours 57 minutes (Z-score -1.53), consistently falling below the population average. Sleep onset is consistently late, around 02:34 AM, with low variability (Z-score -0.95), indicating a fixed pattern of delayed and insufficient sleep. This objective finding is congruent with the participant's self-reported ""Disturbed Sleep"" on the PSQI (score of 6), despite the PSQI Z-score not being particularly high (-0.33) relative to the study population's disturbance levels. Furthermore, analysis of circadian rhythms from heart rate data indicates slightly less stable daily rhythms (Interdaily Stability Z-score -0.57) and greater fragmentation of activity within the day (Intradaily Variability Z-score 0.6), although the correlation of these specific circadian metrics with CES-D is negligible. Interestingly, the participant exhibits an exceptionally low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.28) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -1.22), indicative of excellent cardiovascular fitness, which often co-occurs with positive health.

A notable physiological anomaly is observed in the hourly heart rate data, specifically pronounced elevations above the mesor during the early morning hours. The mean heart rate deviation from the mesor for 1-2 AM is 14.11 beats per minute, corresponding to an exceptionally high Z-score of 3.1 relative to the study population for that hour. This indicates a significant and sustained physiological arousal during a period typically associated with deep sleep or low activity, contrasting with generally expected physiological patterns. While daily activity levels show typical increases during waking hours, peaking in the evening, this specific early morning anomaly stands out. Despite this objective physiological perturbation and the identified sleep deficiencies, the correlations of these wearable metrics (sleep duration, circadian regularity, and hourly heart rate deviations) with CES-D scores are consistently weak or negligible in the provided data. This suggests that for this participant, the self-reported psychological factors, which showed strong correlations with CES-D and indicated positive mental health, may be more salient in determining their overall depressive symptom burden than the observed sleep and early morning physiological disruptions.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile strongly aligns with lower depressive symptomatology. They report very low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.31), high self-esteem (Z-score 1.1), high happiness (Z-score 1.64), and low perceived stress (Z-score -0.98). All these measures have moderate to strong correlations with CES-D scores that consistently indicate a negative relationship with depressive symptoms (e.g., lower anxiety, higher self-esteem, higher happiness, and lower stress are associated with lower CES-D). Furthermore, the participant exhibits above-average health satisfaction (Z-score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.83), both negatively correlated with CES-D. Their consistent high academic achievement and above-average engagement in exercise further support a profile of resilience and effective functioning generally inconsistent with elevated depressive symptoms. Physiologically, an exceptionally low resting heart rate (Z-score -1.28) suggests excellent cardiovascular health, which is typically associated with better overall well-being.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
The primary evidence suggesting potential depressive symptoms stems from objective sleep and physiological data. The participant experiences significantly short median sleep duration (Z-score -1.53) and a consistently late sleep onset. Their self-reported PSQI score of 6 also indicates disturbed sleep. Additionally, there are notable and anomalous heart rate spikes in the early morning hours (e.g., 1-2 AM, Z-score 3.1), indicating significant physiological arousal during a typical rest period. Some circadian rhythm irregularities, such as lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability, also suggest disrupted physiological patterns. These factors (poor sleep, physiological disruption) are recognized risk factors and symptoms of depression.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the objective sleep and early morning physiological data reveal significant disruptions that could be associated with poorer mental health, the correlations provided for these specific wearable metrics with CES-D scores are consistently weak or negligible. In contrast, the participant's self-reported psychological traits (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, stress) show strong correlations with CES-D and consistently indicate a highly positive mental health profile, significantly below average for anxiety and stress, and above average for self-esteem and happiness. Given the robust and convergent evidence from self-report measures, which are strongly correlated with CES-D, it is highly probable that these factors exert a dominant influence on the participant's overall depressive symptom burden. Despite the physiological anomalies, the participant's subjective experience and functional capacity appear to be strong protective factors against elevated depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence and the relative strength of the correlations, it is likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

19245,26.0,0.844559585492228,"The participant's data reveals a complex profile characterized by significant psychological distress and notable disturbances in sleep and physiological regulation, despite some areas of adaptive functioning.

**Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis**

The participant exhibits a pronounced pattern of psychological distress, as evidenced by multiple self-report measures. Trait anxiety, measured by the STAI scale, is significantly elevated (Score: 55.0, Z-score: 1.35), indicating a heightened predisposition to anxiety, a factor strongly correlated with depressive symptoms (r=0.81). Similarly, perceived stress levels are considerably above the population average (Score: 27.0, Z-score: 1.47), contributing to an overall sense of burden. Self-reported current happiness is notably low (Score: 2.0, Z-score: -1.61), and self-esteem is slightly below average (Score: 35.0, Z-Score: -0.45), both of which are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D scores (r=-0.46 and r=-0.71, respectively), suggesting a diminished sense of well-being and self-worth. A striking finding is the exceptionally low score on interpersonal trust (Score: 2.17, Z-score: -2.07), which is negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.41), potentially indicating social withdrawal or a cynical outlook that can accompany depressive states. Health satisfaction is also below average (Z-score: -0.78), further contributing to a generally negative self-perception. Despite these challenges, the participant demonstrates high academic achievement, maintaining a 4.0 GPA in the 2016 Fall semester. Lifestyle behaviors present a mixed picture: the participant engages in above-average levels of exercise, both alone and with others, which are typically protective factors for mental health. However, there is also above-average reported usage of beer and recreational drugs, which could reflect maladaptive coping strategies. Engagement in social activities and hobbies like listening to music is also above average, suggesting some continued engagement in leisure and social interactions.

Sleep patterns and circadian rhythms show substantial disruption. Subjective sleep quality is poor, as indicated by a PSQI score of 7.0, which typically signifies clinically significant sleep disturbance. Objective Fitbit data corroborate this, showing a significantly high median sleep duration of 8 hours and 6 minutes (Z-score: 1.14), which, while long, is accompanied by marked variability in both sleep duration (Z-score: 1.23) and sleep start time (Z-score: 0.92). The median sleep start time is notably late (02:38:30), and the participant reports a significantly higher frequency of daily naps (Z-score: 2.27). These objective indicators of sleep irregularity, including increased sleep duration variability and napping, are all positively correlated with CES-D scores, reinforcing their potential link to depressive symptoms. Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals lower interdaily stability (Z-score: -0.82), indicating less regularity in daily physiological patterns across days. Furthermore, aggregated hourly heart rate data show heightened physiological activity during late evening and early morning hours (e.g., 10 PM - 1 AM, with Z-scores up to 2.25), followed by notably lower heart rate deviations during typical morning activity hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, Z-score: -1.73). This pattern suggests a potential phase delay or overall disruption in the participant's physiological arousal rhythm, where activity extends later into the night with a blunted morning peak. Paradoxically, the participant maintains a low resting heart rate (Z-score: -1.02) and a lower overall heart rate mesor (Z-score: -1.03), which generally indicate good cardiovascular fitness, potentially moderating the physiological impact of the observed stress and sleep irregularities.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile) is robust and multifaceted. The participant exhibits significantly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z-score: 1.35) and perceived stress (PSS Z-score: 1.47), both of which are positively correlated with CES-D. Critically, subjective well-being is markedly low, with a very low happiness score (Z-score: -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (Z-score: -0.45), both strongly negatively correlated with CES-D. An exceptionally low level of interpersonal trust (Z-score: -2.07) also aligns with potential features of depressive states. The participant's sleep architecture is comprehensively disturbed, as indicated by poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI: 7.0), high variability in sleep duration and start times, late sleep onset, and frequent napping, all of which are positively correlated with CES-D and reflect common depressive symptoms. Physiologically, the disrupted circadian rhythm, particularly the elevated heart rate during late night hours and blunted morning activity, suggests dysregulation consistent with distress. While academic performance is high and exercise habits are regular, these factors appear insufficient to offset the pervasive psychological and physiological indicators of distress. The confluence of significantly elevated anxiety, stress, very low happiness, low self-esteem, extreme distrust, and a highly disturbed sleep profile strongly suggests a substantial burden of depressive symptoms. The population median CES-D score is 11.0. Given the magnitude and consistency of the indicators, it is highly probable that the participant's overall CES-D score would fall above this median.

The participant presents a complex profile, characterized by strong indicators of psychological well-being alongside notable behavioral and physiological patterns that suggest underlying discrepancies. Self-report measures consistently depict a highly resilient psychological state. The participant scored exceptionally low on trait anxiety (STAI score of 24.0, Z-score -1.71), classifying them as ""not anxious"" relative to the study population, a finding that correlates strongly and positively with lower depressive symptoms (r=0.82). Similarly, self-esteem is notably high (score 49.0, Z-score 1.52), which inversely correlates with depressive symptoms (r=-0.71). High self-reported happiness (score 5.0, Z-score 1.64) and lower perceived stress (score 19.0, Z-score -0.71) further reinforce this picture, both demonstrating correlations consistent with lower depressive symptomatology (happiness r=-0.46, stress r=0.28). Overall health satisfaction is also above average (Z-score 0.72), negatively correlated with CES-D (r=-0.39), contributing to the robust self-reported psychological health.

Behaviorally, the participant maintains a highly active lifestyle, reporting exercise across multiple categories ""three times a week or more,"" with Z-scores well above 1.0, indicating significantly higher activity levels than their peers. These exercise patterns are modestly correlated with lower CES-D scores. Substance usage is minimal across all categories, with negative Z-scores, indicating abstinence or very infrequent use, which is generally associated with better health outcomes. However, a salient deviation from typical social behavior is observed: the participant reports socializing with friends for ""15 minutes or less"" per day, an extremely low engagement level reflected in a Z-score of -2.2. While the correlation of this specific behavior with CES-D in the study population is negligible (r=-0.02), such profound social isolation stands out amidst an otherwise positive self-reported profile and can be a significant behavioral marker.

Physiological data from wearable devices reveal both consistent and contrasting patterns. The participant's resting heart rate (55.3 bpm, Z-score -0.34) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor 69.43, Z-score -0.62) are lower than the population average. Both lower resting heart rate and Mesor show a positive correlation with CES-D (r=0.19), suggesting these physiological indicators align with lower depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm metrics show slightly below-average interdaily stability (Z-score -0.33) and lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z-score -0.87), suggesting a moderate degree of day-to-day variability in heart rate patterns. However, sleep metrics indicate a consistent sleep-wake schedule, with significantly less variability in sleep start time than the population average (Z-score -0.93), which is positively correlated with lower CES-D (r=0.21). Despite this regularity in sleep onset, the participant's subjective sleep quality is rated as ""disturbed sleep"" (PSQI score of 6.0), although their PSQI Z-score (-0.33) suggests this disturbance is not exceptionally worse than the average student in the study. Median sleep duration is slightly below average at 6 hours 54 minutes (Z-score -0.35).

A significant discrepancy emerges from the hourly heart rate data, which provides a key counterpoint to the self-reported low stress and anxiety. While morning heart rate deviations show a rise indicative of activity (e.g., 8-9am Z-score 1.03), the data reveals exceptionally high physiological arousal extending very late into the night. Hourly deviations from Mesor show significantly elevated heart rates in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 6-7pm Z-score 2.67), culminating in strikingly high values late at night (e.g., 10-11pm Z-score 1.68, and 11-12am Z-score 3.51). These substantially elevated heart rates in the hours leading up to and past midnight indicate a level of physiological activity or arousal that is profoundly atypical compared to the study population. This objective pattern of sustained high physiological activity contrasts sharply with the participant's self-reports of low anxiety and stress, and could be a significant factor contributing to their subjectively ""disturbed sleep"" despite a consistent sleep schedule. The acrophase, or peak in heart rate activity, is observed relatively late at 5:35 PM, which, in conjunction with the very late-night elevations, suggests a shifted or extended period of heightened physiological engagement.

**Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50%):**
The participant exhibits a substantial and consistent pattern of self-reported psychological well-being, which aligns strongly with lower depressive symptoms. They report very low trait anxiety (STAI Z-score -1.71, r=0.82), high self-esteem (Z-score 1.52, r=-0.71), and high happiness (Z-score 1.64, r=-0.46). All these measures are significantly deviant from the population mean in a positive direction and exhibit strong correlations with lower CES-D scores. Furthermore, perceived stress is below average (Z-score -0.71, r=0.28), and health satisfaction is above average (Z-score 0.72, r=-0.39). Lifestyle factors such as high exercise frequency (Z-scores >1.0, negative CES-D correlations) and minimal substance use also support lower depressive symptomatology. Physiologically, both resting heart rate (Z-score -0.34) and overall mean heart rate (Mesor Z-score -0.62) are lower than average, with modest positive correlations to CES-D (r=0.19), indicating these objective metrics also lean towards lower depressive burden. Stable sleep start times (Z-score -0.93 for variability, r=0.21) and the absence of naps (Z-score -0.86, r=0.21) are further indicators associated with lower CES-D.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50%):**
Despite the numerous positive indicators, some data points suggest potential areas of concern that could contribute to, or be associated with, elevated depressive symptoms. The participant reports subjectively ""disturbed sleep"" with a PSQI score of 6.0, exceeding the common clinical cutoff of 5. While their PSQI Z-score (-0.33) is slightly below average for the study population, the absolute score indicates a problematic sleep experience. Most notably, the participant reports extremely limited social interaction (socializing with friends ""15 minutes or less,"" Z-score -2.2). Although the correlation of this specific behavior with CES-D is nearly zero (r=-0.02) within this study, significant social withdrawal is a recognized symptom frequently associated with depression. The hourly heart rate data presents a compelling physiological anomaly, indicating remarkably high levels of physiological arousal persisting very late into the night, with Z-scores reaching up to 3.51 in the hour before midnight. This objective, sustained hyperarousal contradicts self-reported low stress and anxiety, potentially reflecting a state of chronic physiological dysregulation that could contribute to depressive symptomology or impaired well-being, even if not directly captured by self-report.

**Holistic Analysis:**
When balancing the evidence, the highly consistent and profoundly positive self-reported psychological traits (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, stress) carry substantial weight. These measures are strongly correlated with CES-D in the direction of lower depressive symptoms and show significant positive deviations (e.g., Z-scores of -1.71 for anxiety, 1.52 for self-esteem, 1.64 for happiness). While the objectively measured extreme late-night physiological arousal and the self-reported significant social isolation are critical findings indicative of potential underlying stress, dysregulation, or behavioral patterns associated with poor mental health, their direct and strong correlational link to *elevated* CES-D scores within this specific study dataset is less pronounced compared to the robust self-report indicators. The PSQI score, while clinically ""disturbed,"" is not an extreme outlier within the study population. The cumulative strength of the evidence from the most strongly correlated self-report measures heavily favors a lower depressive symptom burden. Therefore, despite the significant physiological and behavioral flags, the participant's overall profile, particularly concerning the factors most predictive of CES-D scores in this study, suggests their depressive symptom burden is likely in the lower range.

**Psychological Traits and Subjective Well-being**
The participant's self-reported psychological profile presents a nuanced picture. A score of 45 on the STAI-Trait scale, categorized as ""anxious"" and corresponding to a Z-score of 0.37, indicates slightly elevated trait anxiety compared to the study population. This finding is particularly salient given the strong positive correlation (0.81) between STAI scores and CES-D, suggesting that higher anxiety is linked to an increased burden of depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant reported a high level of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score of 40, Z-score of 0.26), which strongly correlates negatively with CES-D (-0.71), suggesting a protective factor against depressive symptomatology. Further, self-reported happiness (score 4.0, Z-score 0.55) and interpersonal trust (score 3.5, Z-score 0.5) are above average, and perceived stress (PSS score 21.0, Z-score -0.17) is below the population mean; all these metrics correlate negatively with CES-D. However, satisfaction with physical health is notably lower than average (score 3.22, Z-score -0.78), a factor associated with higher CES-D scores (-0.39). This combination suggests a psychological landscape marked by underlying anxiety alongside relatively positive self-perception and lower general stress, but with specific concerns regarding health satisfaction.

**Sleep Patterns and Circadian Rhythmicity**
Sleep quality appears compromised, as indicated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 7.0, classifying the participant as experiencing ""Disturbed Sleep,"" despite a Z-score close to the population mean (0.13). Wearable data shows a median sleep duration of 6 hours 49 minutes, which is slightly below the population average (Z-score -0.46). A significant finding is the high variability in nightly sleep duration, with a standard deviation of 151 minutes (Z-score 1.14), a characteristic that positively correlates with CES-D (0.2). The median sleep start time is 01:28:09, with average variability (80 minutes, Z-score -0.06). Analysis of heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics reveals a pattern of high interdaily stability (Z-score 0.58) and low intradaily variability (Z-score -1.38), suggesting a relatively consistent and structured daily physiological rhythm. However, the participant exhibits an elevated mean heart rate (MESOR 82.2, Z-score 1.13) and a robust amplitude (16.02, Z-score 1.69) in their heart rate rhythm, with the acrophase (peak activity) occurring relatively late at 5:43 PM. The elevated MESOR positively correlates with CES-D (0.19), potentially indicating a higher baseline physiological arousal.

**Daily Activity and Physiological Arousal**
Behavioral habits reflect a largely sedentary lifestyle and limited social engagement. The participant reports ""Not at all"" for all categories of exercise (exercising alone, with others, or sports), with very low corresponding Z-scores (e.g., -1.93 for exercising alone). Socializing with friends is also minimal, reported as ""16-30 minutes"" daily, with a Z-score of -1.41, indicating significantly less social interaction than peers. Other recreational activities vary, with relatively low internet usage and reading, but average engagement in video games and sedentary hobbies. Substance use is consistently low or non-existent. Analysis of aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor reveals a pronounced peak in physiological arousal during the evening, particularly between 7-8 PM, where the mean heart rate deviates by +24.66 bpm above the mesor, corresponding to an exceptionally high Z-score of 2.29. This significant evening elevation suggests substantial cardiovascular activity or heightened arousal during this period, contrasting with deeper dips in heart rate observed during typical sleeping hours (e.g., -24.88 bpm below mesor between 3-4 AM). The combination of pervasive physical inactivity, limited social interaction, and marked evening physiological arousal could reflect patterns associated with psychological distress or difficulty with restorative behaviors.

**Task 2: Overall Ranking of CES-D Score**

**Evidence for a low or median CES-D score (bottom 50th percentile):**
Several self-reported measures suggest a relatively lower burden of depressive symptomatology. The participant reports higher self-esteem (Z-score 0.26), which holds a strong negative correlation with CES-D (-0.71). Similarly, higher self-reported happiness (Z-score 0.55) and greater interpersonal trust (Z-score 0.5) are observed, both correlating negatively with CES-D (-0.46 and -0.41, respectively). Furthermore, the participant perceives lower-than-average stress (Z-score -0.17), which correlates positively with CES-D (0.28), implying lower stress is associated with lower depressive symptoms. Wearable data indicates a lower intradaily variability in heart rate (Z-score -1.38) and a slightly lower resting heart rate (Z-score -0.15), although the correlations with CES-D are weaker (negative for variability, positive for resting HR). These factors collectively point towards certain psychological strengths and lower subjective distress that could be associated with a CES-D score in the bottom half of the population distribution.

**Evidence for a high CES-D score (top 50th percentile):**
Conversely, significant indicators from both self-report and wearable data suggest an elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant’s STAI-Trait score is classified as ""anxious"" (Z-score 0.37) and exhibits a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (0.81), indicating a direct link to higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor, with a PSQI score of 7.0, signifying ""Disturbed Sleep,"" a common feature of depression. Objective sleep data reveals significantly high variability in sleep duration (Z-score 1.14), which positively correlates with CES-D (0.2). Behavioral patterns are also concerning: the participant reports no engagement in exercise activities (Z-scores ranging from -1.93 to -1.09) and very low social interaction (Z-score -1.41). Physiologically, the overall mean heart rate (Mesor) is elevated (Z-score 1.13), correlating positively with CES-D (0.19). Most notably, a highly anomalous peak in physiological arousal is observed in the evening (7-8 PM), with heart rate deviating +24.66 bpm above mesor, corresponding to an exceptionally high Z-score of 2.29. This intense evening arousal, coupled with a pervasive lack of physical activity, social withdrawal, and disturbed sleep, suggests a pattern of significant physiological and behavioral dysregulation often associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Additionally, lower satisfaction with physical health (Z-score -0.78) is a factor linked to higher CES-D.

**Holistic Analysis and Conclusion:**
While the participant exhibits psychological strengths such as higher self-esteem, happiness, and trust, alongside lower perceived stress, these are counterbalanced by substantial objective and behavioral indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms. The strong positive association between elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and CES-D, combined with clinically significant disturbed sleep (PSQI score of 7), marked variability in sleep duration, a pervasive lack of exercise, and severe social withdrawal, presents a compelling picture of compromised well-being. Furthermore, the significantly elevated mean heart rate and the highly atypical evening peak in physiological arousal point to an underlying state of heightened internal activation or distress that is not adequately reflected in some subjective positive reports. The cumulative weight of these physiological and behavioral patterns, which are strongly linked to depressive symptoms, outweighs the self-reported positive psychological attributes for the purpose of assessing overall depressive symptom burden. Therefore, it is most likely that the participant's overall depressive symptom burden, as measured by the CES-D, would place them in the top half of the study population distribution.
