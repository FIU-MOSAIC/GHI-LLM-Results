44869,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"The self-report profile presents a mixture of protective and risk-related indicators relevant to depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23) is in the non-anxious range and aligns with a protective pattern given the strong positive correlation between anxiety and CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.82). Global self-esteem is at the top of the scale (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and, because self-esteem correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), this is another robust protective feature. Perceived stress is near the sample average (PSS = 21, Z ≈ -0.17), so stress does not appear markedly elevated. Subjective current happiness is lower than average (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53, r ≈ -0.46), which is a signal consistent with increased depressive symptoms but is moderate in magnitude relative to the protective traits noted above.

Sleep-related self-report and wearable-derived sleep metrics reveal a complex sleep pattern that could contribute to mood symptoms. The participant reports poor sleep quality (PSQI = 10, classified as disturbed sleep). Fitbit-derived median nocturnal sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 26 m, Z = 1.55) but is accompanied by large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 193 minutes, Z = 2.09) and substantial variability in sleep start time (SD = 157 minutes, Z = 1.63) with a late median sleep onset (~01:00). The concordance of long average sleep with poor subjective quality and high variability suggests irregular sleep timing and fragmentation rather than restorative, stable sleep. These objective instability metrics (sleep SD and sleep start variability) have small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), indicating they may modestly raise risk for greater depressive symptoms even if they are not determinative on their own.

Behavioral activity and lifestyle data indicate low physical activity and a high degree of sedentary leisure. The participant reports exercising alone only 1–2 times a month and not exercising with others or participating in sports (large negative Z-scores for exercise behaviors). Recreational drug and alcohol use are essentially absent. Daily free-time activities are shifted toward passive behaviors: watching TV/videos (2–3 hours, Z = 1.91) and an unusually large amount of time devoted to a sedentary hobby (more than 4 hours, Z = 3.19). Socializing with friends is present but limited (1–2 hours, Z = 0.16). Low physical activity and high sedentary behavior are modestly associated with higher CES-D in many samples; here the correlations are small (e.g., sedentary hobby r ≈ 0.11), so these behaviors are likely mild-to-moderate risk contributors rather than dominant predictors.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm features point to elevated physiological arousal combined with reduced rhythm amplitude and greater fragmentation. Resting heart rate is elevated (78.4 bpm, Z = 2.41) and MESOR is high (88.34, Z = 1.97), while amplitude is lower than typical (amplitude Z = -0.91). Intradaily variability is elevated (0.71, Z = 1.16) with only modest interdaily stability (0.43, Z = 0.17). The aggregated hourly deviations show clear nocturnal declines and daytime increases consistent with activity cycles, but overall the circadian profile suggests higher baseline cardiovascular activation and reduced day–night contrast. Resting heart rate and some rhythm instability measures have small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), indicating they may be physiological markers that modestly covary with depressive symptom burden.

Integrative interpretation and likely CES-D placement: weighing the pattern across modalities, there are clear protective signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, minimal substance use) that are strongly associated with lower CES-D scores in the sample. Countervailing signals include subjective sleep disturbance, irregular and fragmented sleep timing, elevated resting heart rate and circadian fragmentation, low physical activity, and somewhat lower self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust. Many of these risk indicators have only small-to-moderate correlations with CES-D in the dataset; by contrast, the strong inverse predictors (high self-esteem and low anxiety) argue for a lower aggregate depressive symptom burden. On balance, the multimodal evidence suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of CES-D scores in the study population (i.e., not among the higher CES-D group), although sleep and circadian irregularity are notable risk factors that could warrant monitoring.

92552,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"Summary and context:
The participant’s profile contains mixed signals but leans toward features that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptom burden. Self-report measures show elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45; z ≈ 0.37) and sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score = 8; z ≈ 0.59). Several wearable-derived markers indicate circadian irregularity and night-time physiological activation (detailed below). Where available, reported correlations between these measures and CES‑D scores are strong for anxiety (r ≈ 0.81) and self‑esteem (r ≈ −0.71), and moderate for other health and sleep indices; these correlation patterns guide interpretation but do not replace holistic inference.

Self-report psychological and behavioral signals:
Trait anxiety is elevated relative to the study sample (STAI z ≈ 0.37) and has a large positive correlation with CES‑D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.81), which indicates that the participant’s anxiety level is a strong indicator of greater depressive symptomatology in this cohort. Subjective sleep quality is also disturbed (PSQI = 8), a score above common clinical cutoffs, and PSQI z ≈ 0.59 indicates worse-than-average sleep complaints. Current self-reported happiness is somewhat higher than average (Happy z ≈ 0.55) and the available happiness–CES‑D correlation is negative (r ≈ −0.46), which would be protective. Self‑esteem is reported with a value and z-score that are higher than average (SelfEsteem z ≈ 0.82) and the RSES–CES‑D correlation is strongly negative (r ≈ −0.71), another protective signal; however, the raw self‑esteem value appears inconsistent with the scale range (anomalous absolute score), so interpretation should rely more on the relative z-score and known correlation. Perceived stress is near population average (PSS z ≈ −0.17; r ≈ 0.28 with CES‑D), and social activity and substance-use patterns are broadly unremarkable for this sample (socializing ~1–2 hours, alcohol use 1–2 times/week).

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep duration is adequate on average (median nightly duration ≈ 7 h 49 m; z ≈ 0.79) but marked by high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 174 minutes; z ≈ 1.66) and high variability in sleep start times (median sleep start ≈ 03:48 AM; SD ≈ 94 minutes). The combination of very late median sleep onset and high variability suggests a delayed and irregular sleep schedule, which has been associated with elevated depressive symptoms in population studies. Napping frequency is elevated relative to peers (mean daily naps ≈ 0.22; z ≈ 1.75). Circadian summary metrics indicate somewhat reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.24) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.32), consistent with fragmented or less regular 24‑hour structure in heart‑rate rhythms.

Hourly heart‑rate profile and cardiac tone:
The participant’s resting heart rate and overall mesor are lower than the sample mean (Resting HR ≈ 48.8 bpm; mesor ≈ 63 bpm; z’s ≈ −1.11 and −1.49 respectively), consistent with relatively low baseline cardiovascular tone or higher fitness. However, hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced positive deviations (heart rate above the mesor) during late-night and evening hours — notably large positive z-scores between ~12–3 AM and again in the evening — which indicates relatively increased physiological arousal during late-night hours compared with the mesor. Morning hours show substantial negative deviations (e.g., 9–11 AM with z’s near −3), producing a pattern of elevated late-night arousal and lower daytime heart-rate relative to the mesor. These nocturnal/evening elevations in heart rate and the late acrophase (~8:48 PM) align with the delayed sleep timing and may reflect evening activity or arousal that is temporally misaligned with daytime functioning; correlations between these hourly deviations and CES‑D are small in magnitude in this dataset, but the overall irregularity and late-night arousal pattern are consistent with an increased risk profile for depressive symptoms in prior research.

Integrated interpretation with respect to depressive symptom burden:
Protective indicators include relatively high relative self‑esteem (z ≈ 0.82) and an above‑average self‑rated happiness (z ≈ 0.55), and the participant’s low resting heart rate may reflect physical fitness. Conversely, several risk-relevant signals converge: elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES‑D in the sample), subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), a very late and highly variable sleep schedule (median sleep start ≈ 03:48 AM; high SD), increased napping, reduced interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability in heart‑rate rhythms, and objective late-night physiological activation. Several of those measures (notably trait anxiety and sleep disturbance/irregularity) have relatively strong associations with CES‑D in the cohort-level correlations provided and have substantial clinical relevance for depressive symptom burden.

Conclusion about CES‑D distribution placement:
Weighing the high trait anxiety (strong cohort-level association with CES‑D), objective and subjective sleep disturbance with delayed/irregular timing, and circadian fragmentation against protective signals (relative self‑esteem and self-rated happiness), the balance of evidence indicates a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptom burden compared with the average participant in this sample. Therefore the participant is more likely to lie in the top half of the CES‑D distribution.

73158,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"Self-report measures indicate a profile broadly consistent with low current depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, z = -1.71), elevated self-esteem (RSES z = 1.66), above-average momentary happiness (z = 1.64), and a PSQI score indicative of good subjective sleep (PSQI = 4, z = -1.26). Perceived stress is modestly below sample average (PSS z = -0.71) and health satisfaction is above average (z = 0.8). Behavioral reports show minimal substance use and frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times weekly, z = 1.23), which together with high self-esteem and lower anxiety/higher happiness form a constellation of protective psychosocial factors. Several of these self-report scales have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.81, Self-Esteem r ≈ -0.71, Happiness r ≈ -0.46), and the participant’s positions on those scales would predict relatively lower CES-D scores.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a mixed but not strongly concerning pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 11 min, z = -1.25), but subjective sleep quality is rated as good. Sleep timing is relatively consistent (median start ~23:35, sleep start SD z ≈ -0.36) and naps are essentially absent. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate indicate a coherent daily rhythm (autocorrelation at 24h and interdaily stability near the sample mean, intradaily variability slightly below average), a mesor and resting heart rate that are low relative to the sample (mesor z ≈ -1.1, resting HR 48.2 bpm z ≈ -1.18), and a pronounced morning elevation in heart rate relative to mesor (largest positive deviations around 6–7am, with very large positive z-scores at those hours). These wearable findings suggest a relatively regular, early-leaning activity/physiological rhythm and likely good cardiovascular fitness; there is little wearable evidence of blunted diurnal variation or fragmented rest-activity patterns that are commonly associated with higher depressive symptomatology.

Integrative assessment and implications for CES-D positioning: across modalities the most salient signals point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Strong protective indicators include low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated momentary happiness, low-to-moderate perceived stress, frequent social exercise, good subjective sleep quality, and regular circadian structure. Potential risk signals are limited to slightly shortened objective sleep duration (≈6.2 h/night) and a few small wearable–CES-D correlations in certain hourly heart rate deviations; however, these are weak relative to the robust self-report indicators that are strongly associated with CES-D in the sample. On balance, the multimodal evidence converges on relatively low CES-D symptom severity compared with the study population distribution.

45963,22.0,0.8031088082901554,"Self-report indicators show a cluster of affective symptoms and risk features consistent with elevated internalizing distress. Trait anxiety is markedly high (STAI = 62; Z = 2.05) and is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), indicating chronic anxiety proneness that maps closely to depressive symptom variance in this population. Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES = 30; Z = -1.15) with a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), while momentary happiness is low (current = 2.0; Z = -1.61). Perceived stress is above the sample mean (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65). Subjective sleep quality is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7.0; Z = 0.13). These converging self-report signals—high anxiety and stress, low happiness and self-worth, and disturbed subjective sleep—collectively indicate elevated affective symptom burden relative to peers.

Behavioral activity and social-recreational data show mixed engagement: the participant reports limited solitary exercise (exercised alone: “not at all”, Z = -1.93) but some group exercise or sports (1–2 times/week; Zs ~ 0.5–0.9). Social time is modest (socializing 1–2 hours; Z = 0.16). Recreational profile includes relatively high music listening (2–3 hours; Z = 1.13) but little TV, gaming, reading, or sedentary hobbies. Substance use is low-to-moderate (infrequent beer, wine 1–2×/week). Academic performance appears strong (GPAs in the ~3.6–3.98 range), indicating preserved academic functioning despite the elevated affective symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep/circadian metrics point to disrupted and irregular rhythms that are behaviorally relevant. Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is very low (IS = 0.16; Z = -2.06), and amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (amplitude = 4.2; Z = -2.13), indicating a weak and poorly-entrained circadian signature across days. Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 68.2 bpm, Z = 1.2; MESOR = 81.8, Z = 1.07), consistent with higher tonic autonomic arousal. Aggregated hourly deviations show elevated heart rate near midnight–1am and pronounced negative deviations during early morning hours, consistent with a delayed and consolidated sleep episode: the median sleep-start time is late (01:56 AM) with very high night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD = 215 min; Z = 2.89). Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 40 min; Z = -0.64) with moderately variable sleep duration (SD = 115 min). These objective rhythm and sleep markers (late, irregular sleep timing; low interdaily stability; low amplitude) are often associated with mood disturbance and with poorer subjective sleep, and several of these metrics show modest positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., sleep timing variability r ≈ 0.21).

Integrated interpretation: multiple independent data streams converge on a pattern of elevated affective symptom burden with preserved academic functioning. High trait anxiety and low self-esteem—both strongly correlated with CES-D—along with low reported happiness and disturbed subjective sleep, provide direct self-report evidence of higher depressive symptomatology. Wearable data reinforce this picture: weak, low-amplitude circadian rhythms, elevated resting heart rate, late and highly variable sleep onset, and somewhat reduced total sleep time are physiological and behavioral patterns that commonly co-occur with higher depressive symptoms. Activity and social measures do not clearly indicate severe behavioral withdrawal (some group exercise and modest socializing), but limited solitary exercise and few sedentary hobbies suggest restricted routine activities. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence (strong affective self-report signals plus objective circadian/sleep irregularity and elevated autonomic tone) favors placement in the higher half of depressive symptom burden within this study sample.

22138,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"Trait and symptom self-report shows a mixed picture with several indications of elevated internalizing symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) is meaningfully above the cohort mean, and the instrument’s correlation with CES-D in this sample is large (r ≈ 0.81), making high anxiety a strong predictor of higher depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65; r with CES-D ≈ 0.28), and current happiness is below average (self-rated “Happy” = 3.0, Z = -0.53; r ≈ -0.46), both of which align with risk for greater depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is low (Z = -0.78; r ≈ -0.41), another correlate that tends to co-occur with higher depressive symptom scores. One notable protective self-report signal is a relatively high self-esteem index (reported score 42, Z = 0.54, r with CES-D ≈ -0.71); the numeric value exceeds the typical scale ceiling reported here (possible data inconsistency), but the Z-score and strong negative correlation with CES-D imply that higher self-regard would be expected to lower depressive symptom burden for this participant.

Behavioral-social patterns show both risk and protective elements. The participant reports limited solitary exercise (no exercise alone; Z = -1.93) but frequent group exercise (three times a week or more; Z = 1.23, r ≈ -0.23), which is a protective behavioral resource against mood disturbance. Socializing duration is lower than average (≈31 minutes per hour, Z = -0.62), and recreational sedentary behaviors (watching videos, internet use) are above average; these patterns can be neutral-to-modestly risk-related depending on social context. Substance and drug use are low to modest (alcohol use occasional; no recreational or non-prescribed drug use), so these are unlikely major contributors to depressive symptom variance. Academic functioning (GPAs reported) is strong, which may reflect preserved functioning in at least one life domain.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology from the wearable indicate generally adequate sleep quantity, reasonable sleep regularity, and preserved circadian structure. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 32 min (Z = 0.43) with near-zero naps; subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) classifies as relatively good. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈01:15 AM) with above-average night-to-night variability in sleep onset (sleep-start SD Z = 0.83), suggesting a late and somewhat variable sleep schedule; however overall sleep duration and low nap frequency argue against pervasive sleep disruption. Circadian features derived from heart rate show moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.5), relatively low intradaily fragmentation (IV Z = -0.53), above-average amplitude (Z = 0.73), and a mesor and resting heart rate near cohort mean—collectively indicating a fairly robust, well-structured daily rhythm and consistent daytime–nighttime separation in physiological arousal. The heart-rate acrophase at ~4:20 PM and typical nocturnal heart rate dipping further support intact circadian organization.

Integrating signals across modalities with attention to the provided correlations: the strongest single predictor of higher CES-D in this dataset is trait anxiety (high here) and low self-esteem (here, the z-score suggests higher-than-average self-esteem which would be protective). Other moderate contributors favoring elevated depressive symptoms include elevated perceived stress, reduced subjective happiness, and low interpersonal trust. By contrast, objective sleep quantity/quality, robust circadian rhythmicity, engagement in group exercise, strong academic performance, and absence of problematic substance use are factors that tend to mitigate depression risk. Given the relative strengths of these signals and the sample correlations, the large positive association between anxiety and CES-D, combined with the participant’s above-average anxiety and lower happiness/trust, suggests greater than average depressive symptomatology despite some protective resources.

Weighing risk versus protective evidence holistically, the dominant risk signal is trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D) accompanied by elevated stress and reduced positive affect and interpersonal trust; protective signals (good sleep duration and quality, structured circadian rhythm, group exercise, strong academic functioning, low substance use) are present but generally have weaker sample correlations with CES-D in this dataset. On balance, the preponderance of evidence points toward this participant having CES-D scores in the higher half of the study distribution.

31439,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"Summary of self-report psychological traits and symptoms:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76) — this is one of the most salient self-report signals and is highly correlated with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81). Current self-rated happiness is below the sample average (current = 3.0; Z = -0.53; CES-D r = -0.46), and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38; CES-D r = 0.28). Self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES = 39; Z = 0.11) and has a strong inverse association with depressive symptoms in the cohort (CES-D r = -0.71), representing a potentially protective influence. Interpersonal trust is low relative to peers (Trust Z = -1.42; CES-D r = -0.41), a feature that often accompanies greater depressive symptomatology. Overall, the self-report profile shows a mixture of risk signals (notably high trait anxiety, lowered happiness, lower interpersonal trust, and some perceived stress) alongside a modest protective signal in self-esteem.

Sleep, circadian structure, and wearable-derived physiology:
Wearable and sleep reports indicate moderately shortened and somewhat irregular sleep timing with objective and subjective signals of disturbed sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 h 41 min (Z = -0.61) and the PSQI exceeded the common threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), consistent with poorer subjective sleep quality. Median sleep onset was late (≈00:39) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 67 minutes). Circadian heart-rate metrics show a robustly elevated central heart-rate level (Mesor = 91.39; Z = 2.38) and elevated resting heart rate (78.2 bpm; Z = 2.38), both modestly positively associated with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.19). Nonparametric circadian measures indicate reasonable regularity: interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.44; Z = 0.25) and intradaily variability is lower than typical (0.37; Z = -1.24), suggesting relatively consistent day–night structure despite reduced sleep duration. Hourly aggregate deviations show normal nocturnal heart-rate dips and daytime rises; the overall profile reflects an elevated baseline cardiovascular tone superimposed on a relatively regular daily pattern.

Behavioral habits and context:
The participant reports normative academic functioning (GPAs in the 3.4–3.7 range) and moderate social and activity engagement (socializing ~1–2 hours/day; exercising ~1–2 times/week). Alcohol use (beer, wine/spirit: 1–2 times/week) is higher than average for the sample (Z ≈ 1.0) but shows minimal correlation with CES-D here. Sedentary recreation (watching video content) is somewhat above average (Z = 1.28) while internet and gaming time are low. Napping is minimal. Taken together, behavioral data indicate ongoing engagement in school and social activities with some leisure patterns that are slightly more passive than peers, but not extreme.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
The strongest risk indicators for elevated depressive symptoms in this profile are elevated trait anxiety (highly predictive of CES-D across the study), reduced self-reported happiness, low interpersonal trust, disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, and an elevated resting/mesor heart rate. These signals point toward increased affective and physiological arousal and some social/interpersonal depletion. Offsetting factors include modestly higher self-esteem (a robust protective correlate), continued academic success and routine social/exercise engagement, and relatively stable day–night circadian organization (low intradaily variability and moderate interdaily stability). On balance, the preponderance of risk-related signals (particularly the high trait anxiety combined with lower happiness and biological markers of elevated baseline arousal) outweigh the modest protective factors. Therefore, considering the relative magnitudes and the sample-level correlations provided, the profile is more consistent with CES-D scores in the upper half of the study distribution.

46558,17.0,0.727979274611399,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant’s self-report measures consistently indicate relatively low affective distress and preserved self-regard. Trait anxiety on the STAI is 37 (z ≈ -0.43), classified as not anxious; Rosenberg self-esteem is high at 35 (z ≈ -0.45), and current self-reported happiness is elevated (score 5, z ≈ 1.64). The PSQI score of 5 places subjective sleep quality at the cusp of the usual threshold for disturbance but is reported here as “Good Sleep” (z ≈ -0.8). Perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 22, z ≈ 0.1). Importantly, survey-to-CES-D correlations in this dataset show very strong positive association of STAI with CES-D and a strong negative association of self-esteem with CES-D; given the participant’s low anxiety and relatively high self-esteem, these dimensions point toward lower depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns: The participant has several notable lifestyle features that interact with mental health risk. Exercise engagement is minimal (rarely exercising, negative z-scores), and sedentary recreational activities are comparatively high — especially video gaming (2–3 hours/day, z ≈ 3.23) and other sedentary hobbies (2–3 hours/day, z ≈ 2.01). Socializing time is above-average (2–3 hours, z ≈ 0.95). Substance use is minimal. Academic performance shows modestly low GPAs across semesters listed. Overall, the behavioral profile mixes protective social/happiness indicators with low physical activity and high sedentary leisure; correlations between these behavioral metrics and CES-D in the sample are small, so their explanatory weight for depressive symptoms is limited in this case.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: The Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate a generally regular and sufficient sleep pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 5 minutes (z ≈ -0.12), with low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 58 minutes, z ≈ -0.98). Mean sleep start time is relatively late (median ~01:14 AM) but consistent (start time SD ≈ 55 minutes, z ≈ -0.61). Napping is essentially absent. Circadian summary metrics from heart rate show moderate to good structure: interdaily stability (0.51, z ≈ 0.83) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.41, z ≈ 0.73) indicate a reasonably regular daily rhythm; intradaily variability is modest (0.59, z ≈ 0.32). MESOR (~73 bpm) and amplitude (~10 bpm) are near sample average, and acrophase around 5:17 PM is plausible for an evening-active profile. Hourly heart-rate deviations show an expected nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations ~ -17 bpm in the early morning) and an afternoon/evening peak (largest positive deviation ~ +16.7 bpm at 7–8 PM), consistent with consolidated sleep and daytime activity.

Integration and interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Across domains the strongest signals relevant to CES-D in this sample come from trait anxiety, self-esteem, and current affect. Those signals uniformly indicate lower depressive symptomatology (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated reported happiness). Objective wearable data corroborate behavioral regularity (stable circadian metrics, sufficient sleep duration, low sleep variability), which typically associates with lower mood symptom severity. Countervailing considerations include low physical activity and pronounced sedentary leisure (notably high video-game time) and a somewhat late sleep onset; however, correlations of these behaviors with CES-D in the dataset are small and the participant’s overall stress level is only modest. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence supports that this participant’s CES-D-related symptom burden is more likely in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

93699,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Summary and symptom-relevant self-report features:
The participant’s self-report profile shows a pattern of modestly elevated anxiety proneness (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) alongside somewhat lower positive self-appraisals and well-being (Rosenberg self-esteem = 35, Z = -0.45; self-rated current happiness = 3.0, Z = -0.53). Sleep quality is notably disturbed on the PSQI (score = 9, Z = 1.05), indicating subjectively poor sleep over the prior month. Perceived stress (PSS = 13, Z = -2.34) is comparatively low relative to the study population, which is an outlying protective signal in this participant’s profile. Subjective health satisfaction is lower than average (score = 2.78, Z = -1.11). Several of these self-report measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the study sample (STAI r = 0.82; Self‑Esteem r = -0.71; happiness r = -0.46; health satisfaction r = -0.39), such that the combination of elevated trait anxiety, reduced self-esteem/happiness, and poor subjective sleep aligns with features that co-occur with higher depressive symptom burden.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a sleep pattern that is slightly shorter and variable relative to the cohort: median nightly sleep ≈ 6 h 51 min (Z = -0.42) with a large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 108 min, Z = 0.16) and a late median sleep start (~00:59, SD ~89 min). The participant reports no habitual naps (Z = -0.86). Heart-rate–based circadian rhythm measures indicate an overall organized daily rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.51, Z = 0.83; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 0.81), a modestly elevated mean heart rate (MESOR 79.36, Z = 0.74) and resting heart rate 64.8 bpm (Z = 0.79). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks, with the largest positive deviation around midday (12–1 pm +16.3, Z = 1.22). In the study-level correlations these wearable circadian and heart-rate measures have small but directionally consistent associations with CES-D (e.g., MESOR and resting HR r ≈ 0.19; sleep variability r ≈ 0.2), implying that the participant’s somewhat elevated basal cardiovascular tone and variable/shorter sleep could be modestly related to greater depressive symptoms.

Behavioral context and lifestyle:
Daily activities indicate high sedentary/online engagement (internet use >4 hours, Z = 2.19) and moderate passive media consumption (watching videos 1–2 hours, Z = 1.28). Socializing time and active solitary exercise are below average (socializing Z = -0.62; exercised alone Z = -0.43), though exercise with others is modestly above average (1–2 times/week, Z = 0.53). Substance and drug use are minimal. BMI is elevated (28.7). Several behavioral variables that are associated with higher CES-D in this sample (high internet use r = 0.26; low social time has small negative correlations) are present, suggesting behavioral patterns that may support lower mood or greater symptom burden; conversely, low substance use and some group exercise are protective features.

Integrated interpretation relative to depressive symptom burden:
Taken together, the strongest signals that track with higher CES‑D scores are elevated trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES‑D in the cohort), objectively disturbed and short/variable sleep (PSQI elevated; sleep timing late and variable), low subjective happiness and health satisfaction, and high solitary/online sedentary behavior. Offsetting features include low perceived stress by PSS, limited substance use, some engagement in group exercise, and relatively preserved circadian rhythmicity. The magnitude of several key indicators (PSQI Z = 1.05; internet use Z = 2.19; health satisfaction Z = -1.11; resting HR Z = 0.79) and the pattern of measures that are correlated with CES‑D (notably STAI and self‑esteem) indicate a non-trivial likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms compared with the study population median. In sum, the profile is more consistent with a participant who would fall above the population median on depressive symptom measures than with one who would fall in the lower half.

84011,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed psychological profile with notable risk signals for affective symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) is elevated relative to the sample and is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.82), which suggests that chronic anxiety-proneness is a prominent feature and a risk factor for higher depressive symptom scores. Rosenberg self-esteem is modestly below the sample mean (score = 33, Z = -0.73) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), so lower self-regard here would also predict greater depressive symptom burden. At the same time, current happiness and perceived stress scores are not indicative of marked distress: self-rated happiness is above average (Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is slightly below average (Z = -0.44), which are features more consistent with lower or moderate depressive symptoms. The PSQI indicates borderline disturbed sleep (score = 6), a potential contributor to mood symptoms, but its population z-score is only mildly below average (Z = -0.33), suggesting subjective sleep complaints are present but not extreme.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators show several protective patterns that temper the risk signaled by the anxiety and self-esteem measures. The participant reports frequent group exercise and sports (exercise with others and sports both reported three or more times per week; Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58 respectively), very low substance use, high academic performance (GPAs near the top of the scale), and positive health satisfaction (Z = 0.55). These behaviors and resources are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology and may mitigate symptom expression. Conversely, self-reported socializing time with friends is low relative to the sample (Z = -1.41), and engagement in other recreational activities (music, reading) is minimal; limited social/leisure engagement could potentiate mood symptoms despite active exercise.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian/physiological metrics show a pattern of generally long and reasonably regular nocturnal sleep alongside evidence of circadian fragmentation in activity-related physiology. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 28 min, Z = 1.59) with no recorded naps, and night-to-night variability in sleep timing is moderate (sleep start SD ≈ 82 minutes, Z ≈ -0.02). These objective sleep metrics do not align with severe insomnia or sleep restriction. Heart-rate–based circadian features show a low mesor and low resting heart rate (mesor 63.1 bpm, Z = -1.48; resting HR 51.4 bpm, Z = -0.8), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness; both of these are modestly positively correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.19), but the participant’s low values would predict lower depressive symptoms on those dimensions. Nonparametric circadian measures indicate reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.49) and elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.02), suggesting some day-to-day irregularity and within-day fragmentation of behavior/physiology. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced afternoon–evening peaks (notably 8–9 pm, Z = 2.19, and 5–6 pm, Z ≈ 1.12), which may reflect concentrated evening activity or arousal; these acute temporal peaks have only small correlations with CES-D in the sample.

Integration and interpretive synthesis: the data present competing signals. The strongest single statistical indicator in this dataset linking to CES-D is trait anxiety (STAI), which is elevated for this participant and is highly predictive of higher CES-D scores (r = 0.82). Lower self-esteem (moderately below average; r = -0.71 with CES-D) provides a second relatively strong risk marker. These two self-report variables together point toward greater depressive symptom burden. Opposing evidence includes robust behavioral protective factors—frequent social exercise and sports participation, low substance use, good objective sleep duration, high academic performance, and favorable health satisfaction—that are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Physiological metrics are mixed: low resting heart rate and mesor (suggesting fitness) plus somewhat fragmented circadian structure. Overall, the weight of evidence is not unequivocal, but the combination of elevated trait anxiety and reduced self-esteem—both strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset—carries substantial predictive weight for higher depressive symptom scores that is not fully offset by the protective lifestyle indicators.

Final assessment: considering the strong, high-correlation risk indicators (trait anxiety and self-esteem) alongside the mitigating lifestyle factors, the balance favors placement in the upper half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

88008,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"Summary of self-report psychological measures and implications for depressive symptomatology:
The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple psychological features that covary with elevated depressive symptoms in this sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 48, z = 0.66) is above the sample mean and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this study (r = 0.81), indicating that chronic anxiety proneness is a salient risk correlate for higher depressive symptom scores. Self-esteem is below average (RSES = 33, z = -0.73) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which also points toward a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms when taken with the STAI result. Subjective happiness is below the sample median (current = 3.0, z = -0.53; r with CES-D = -0.46) and overall health satisfaction and interpersonal trust scores are both below average (z ≈ -0.7 and -0.78, respectively), patterns that align with greater depressive symptom burden in the population correlations. Perceived stress is slightly below average (PSS = 20, z = -0.44) but correlates positively with CES-D (r = 0.28), so stress does not contradict the other risk indicators but is not a particularly prominent signal here.

Objective sleep, circadian, and physiological patterns:
Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate a well-entrained and robust daily rhythm. Circadian regularity metrics are favorable: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.52, z = 0.91), intradaily variability is low (0.30, z = -1.73), amplitude is relatively large (15.36, z = 1.48), and autocorrelation at 24h is above average (z = 0.73). Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.1 bpm, z = -0.36), and hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and evening peaks (notably 7–9 PM), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and active wake periods. These features (high amplitude, stable day-to-day patterning, low fragmentation) are generally protective or at least not characteristic of circadian dysregulation that often accompanies higher depressive burden. However, objective sleep duration is short relative to the sample (median sleep 6 h 9 min, z = -1.29) and the median sleep start time is late (≈01:14), which can contribute to mood vulnerability even if sleep regularity and circadian amplitude remain intact. The wearable-derived sleep measures show low day-to-day variability in timing and few naps, which reduces one class of sleep-related risk.

Behavioral lifestyle factors and their moderating effects:
Lifestyle behaviors provide additional protective signals. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports participation (exercise alone ≥3×/week; sports ≥3×/week; exercise z-scores >1), no alcohol or recreational drug use, modest social time (1–2 hours socializing daily), and low sedentary hobby time. These behaviors typically associate with lower depressive symptomatology (the exercise and substance-use patterns here are consistent with protective health behaviors). Academic performance varies across terms but includes at least one relatively strong term (3.65). Body mass index is slightly above normal (25.8), and although BMI alone is not a strong discriminator here, health satisfaction was below average. Overall, behavioral data contain multiple protective elements (regular exercise, low substance use, robust circadian physiology) that would tend to moderate psychological risk.

Integrated interpretation and balance of evidence regarding CES-D placement:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, there is a divergence between strong self-report signals that align with higher depressive symptoms and objective behavioral/physiological signals that are largely protective. The strongest and most CES-D–predictive indicators in this dataset are the psychological self-reports: high trait anxiety (r = 0.81) and relatively low self-esteem (r = -0.71) are potent correlates of higher CES-D in this population and are both present for this participant. Secondary self-report markers (lower happiness, lower interpersonal trust, lower health satisfaction) further point in that direction. In contrast, wearable-based circadian regularity, low intradaily variability, robust amplitude, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and minimal substance use all argue against severe functional disturbance and are associated with lower depressive symptomatology or resilience. Sleep timing and short nocturnal duration (median ≈6h) provide a mixed signal: short sleep is a potential risk factor, but sleep appears regular and consolidated.

Given the relative strengths of the predictors in this dataset — particularly the very strong correlations between CES-D and trait anxiety and self-esteem, both of which indicate elevated risk for this participant — the balance of evidence favors a placement in the higher half of the CES-D distribution despite several protective lifestyle and physiological features. Thus, the integrated assessment indicates the participant is more likely to be in the top 50% of CES-D scores in the study population.

83566,37.0,0.9715025906735751,"Self-report measures indicate multiple affective signals that align with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = +2.05) is markedly high; this scale has a strong positive correlation with CES-D scores in the sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most informative survey predictors here. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, Z = −1.29), and the RSES has a strong negative association with CES-D (r = −0.71), which further points toward greater symptom burden. Subjective happiness is low (self-rated “Happy” = 2.0, Z = −1.61) and perceived stress is above the sample mean (PSS = 24, Z = +0.65); both of these self-report items correlate with CES-D in the expected directions (happiness r ≈ −0.45; stress r ≈ +0.28). The PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8, Z = +0.59), suggesting the participant experiences sleep-related complaints that commonly co-occur with higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle data provide additional context consistent with increased depressive risk. The participant reports very little social exercise or team activity (exercised with others: “Not at all”, Z = −1.58) and low frequency of solitary exercise (1–2 times a month, Z = −0.43). Time spent socializing and engaging in recreational activities is below the study mean (socializing Z ≈ −0.62; several sedentary hobby measures Zs negative), and substance use is minimal (alcohol and drugs “Not at all”, Zs negative). Low social contact and low activity levels are behavioral patterns that often accompany higher depressive symptoms; the absence of substance use is a potentially protective factor but does not outweigh the social/activity indicators when considered with the strong self-report signals above. Academic performance (GPAs in the mid-3.5s) does not indicate functional decline in coursework.

Wearable-derived physiological and sleep metrics show a mixed profile: objective sleep duration is relatively long and consistent while sleep timing is markedly delayed. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 8 minutes (Z = +1.18), with low day-to-day variability in duration (SD Z = −0.82) and infrequent naps (Z = −0.86). However, median sleep start time is late (about 01:52 AM) with moderate variability (start-time SD ~66 minutes, Z ≈ −0.37), a pattern that can be linked to mood disturbance in student populations. Cardiovascular features indicate modest physiological arousal: resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 69.4 bpm, Z = +1.34) and mesor of heart rate is high (mesor = 84.83, Z = +1.49), while circadian rhythm regularity measures (interdaily stability ~0.42, autocorrelation at 24h Z = +0.90) suggest a generally preserved 24-hour structure. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z = +0.24), indicating modest within-day fragmentation. In aggregate, wearable signals point to physiological markers consistent with anxiety/arousal (elevated RHR/mesor) but do not show extreme circadian disruption; the late consistent sleep timing combined with physiological arousal is concordant with the self-report picture of anxious mood and sleep complaints.

Weighing evidence for low/median versus high CES-D placement: evidence supporting lower CES-D (bottom 50%) includes objective, adequate sleep duration and consistent sleep patterns, limited substance use, preserved academic performance, and moderate circadian regularity. Evidence supporting higher CES-D (top 50%) is stronger and more numerous: very high trait anxiety (STAI Z = +2.05) with strong positive correlation to CES-D, low self-esteem (RSES Z = −1.29) with strong negative correlation to CES-D, low self-reported happiness (Z = −1.61), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +0.59), elevated resting heart rate/mesor (Zs > +1) consistent with physiological arousal, and behavioral markers of low social engagement and low exercise. Given the magnitude and predictive strength of the anxiety and self-esteem signals (both strongly correlated with CES-D) together with supporting signals from happiness, stress, subjective sleep disturbance, social withdrawal, and elevated resting physiology, the overall profile more strongly aligns with elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study population median.

87032,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"Self-report profile and symptom-relevant traits: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27) and above-average perceived stress (PSS = 26; Z = 1.19). They also report reduced momentary happiness (current = 3; Z = -0.53) and poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52). Rosenberg self‑esteem is relatively high (36; Z = -0.31), which is a protective correlate in this dataset. Substance use is minimal and academic performance is good (GPAs ~3.4–3.5), indicating preserved behavioral functioning in some domains. Taken together, the survey profile shows a mix of risk markers for elevated depressive symptoms (marked anxiety, high stress, poor sleep) alongside some protective features (higher self‑esteem, intact academic performance, low substance use).

Sleep timing and circadian structure: Objective and subjective sleep metrics indicate circadian and sleep irregularity. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (~6 h 43 min; Z = -0.58) and the median sleep start time is late (about 02:00), with substantial night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.36). The PSQI indicates clinically significant disturbed sleep. Circadian rhythm summary metrics from heart rate show low interdaily stability (0.27; Z = -1.15) and very low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = -1.87), together with elevated intradaily variability (0.75; Z = 1.44). These patterns reflect an irregular, fragmented daily rhythm and inconsistent sleep–wake timing. In the context of known associations between circadian disruption, poor sleep quality, and depressive symptomatology, these wearable-derived markers align with symptom-relevant risk.

Cardiovascular/physiological profile: Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 69.4 bpm, Z = 1.34; mesor = 85.35, Z = 1.56), indicating a higher baseline cardiovascular level across the recording period. The hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime elevations, but several overnight hours show marked negative deviations consistent with sleep periods and daytime hours (mid-afternoon to early evening) show positive deviations. Elevated resting HR and higher mesor in conjunction with self-reported stress/anxiety suggest a modestly increased physiological arousal set point, which in this dataset is positively associated with CES‑D scores.

Behavioral activity and recreation: The participant reports very low engagement in exercise and sports (Z-scores −1.6 to −1.9) and higher-than-average sedentary and screen-based activities (internet and music use Z ≈ 2.0–2.2; watching video content Z = 1.91). Socializing time is moderate (1–2 hours). Low physical activity combined with high sedentary screen time is behaviorally consistent with risk for elevated depressive symptoms in this sample, whereas moderate social contact and preserved academic performance are mitigating factors.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Several of the participant’s strongest and most directly depression‑relevant markers are elevated: trait anxiety (which shows a very large correlation with CES‑D in this dataset), high perceived stress, poor subjective sleep quality, late and irregular sleep timing, and disrupted circadian stability and fragmentation. Physiological signs (elevated resting HR and mesor) and low physical activity provide convergent support for increased symptom burden. Protective signals—relatively high self‑esteem, minimal substance use, and preserved academic performance—temper but do not fully offset the risk pattern. On balance, the preponderance of high‑magnitude correlates (particularly trait anxiety and sleep/circadian disruption) points toward a CES‑D score that is in the upper half of the study distribution rather than the lower half.

94641,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"The self-report profile shows multiple psychological and behavioral signals that are relevant to depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety is substantially elevated (STAI = 54, Z = +1.25) and the STAI–Trait score has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81), which is a robust indicator that greater anxiety proneness here is likely accompanying greater depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is lower than the study mean (RSES = 32, Z = −0.87) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), providing additional evidence that this participant’s affective self‑representation is aligned with higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52), consistent with sleep disturbance that commonly co-occurs with depression. Other self‑reported risk-relevant items include low health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.61), relatively elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z ≈ +0.38), low interpersonal trust (Z ≈ −0.78), minimal socializing (15 minutes or less; Z ≈ −2.20), and virtually no exercise (Z ≈ −1.93). Those behavioral features (low social contact, sedentary leisure, low exercise) align with patterns frequently associated with higher depressive symptom scores in young adult samples. Counterbalancing features on the self‑report side are notable academic success (GPAs ~3.7–3.8), low substance use, and a current self‑rated happiness that is modestly above average (happiness Z ≈ +0.55); however, the strongest survey-based correlates (high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem) point toward elevated rather than low CES‑D scores.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep metrics provide converging signals and some complexity. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 70.3 bpm, Z = +1.44; Mesor = 83.1, Z = +1.25), both of which show modest positive correlations with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.19). The participant’s circadian composition appears reasonably structured: interdaily stability is near the sample mean and the 24-hour autocorrelation is above average (Z ≈ +1.15), while intradaily variability is lower than average (Z ≈ −0.53), indicating relatively stable day‑to‑day heart rate patterns and less within‑day fragmentation. Circadian amplitude is somewhat blunted (Z ≈ −0.47) and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (≈ 4:49 PM). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~00:30), median nightly sleep duration is shorter than the sample average (6 h 15 m, Z ≈ −1.15), and night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration is relatively high (SD = 168 min, Z ≈ +1.52). Napping frequency is elevated (mean daily naps 0.3, Z ≈ +2.66). Together, these wearable features indicate physiological arousal (elevated RHR/mesor), somewhat preserved circadian regularity, but reduced nocturnal sleep duration and greater sleep variability—an ensemble consistent with increased affective burden in many studies, especially when considered alongside the survey indicators.

Synthesis and inference regarding CES‑D placement: evidence pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms includes two of the strongest survey correlates with CES‑D (high trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem), poor subjective sleep quality (high PSQI), behavioral markers of social withdrawal and physical inactivity (very low socializing, no exercise), elevated resting heart rate/mesor, high night‑to‑night sleep variability, and low health satisfaction. Moderating evidence for a lower CES‑D score includes strong academic performance, minimal substance use, modestly elevated self‑reported happiness, and relatively preserved circadian stability and low intradaily fragmentation on the wearable. When weighting features by their known associations with depressive symptoms and by the empirical correlations provided in this dataset (notably STAI and self‑esteem), the preponderance and strength of indicators favor relatively elevated depressive symptom burden compared with the sample distribution.

Based on the integrated pattern of (1) markedly elevated trait anxiety (a strong CES‑D correlate), (2) lower self‑esteem (a strong inverse correlate), (3) poor subjective sleep and irregular sleep patterns, (4) physiological markers (elevated resting HR/mesor), and (5) behavioral withdrawal and inactivity, the overall evidence is more consistent with this participant having a CES‑D score in the upper half of the study population distribution.

82728,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Trait and self-report indicators overall point toward relatively low enduring internalizing symptomatology. The participant’s trait anxiety on the STAI is 39 (z ≈ -0.23, classified “not anxious”), and self-esteem on the RSES is high (score 37, z ≈ -0.17); these two measures have strong population-level correlations with CES-D in the expected directions (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71). Current self-rated happiness is somewhat below the study mean (3.0, z ≈ -0.53), and perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 22, z ≈ 0.10), but the large protective signals from low trait anxiety and high self-esteem suggest lower baseline depressive symptom burden than average.

Lifestyle and behavioral data indicate several healthful patterns that are generally protective against sustained depressive symptoms. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, z ≈ 1.07) and minimal substance use. Academic functioning appears strong (consistent 4.0 GPAs). Social and recreational time is modest but present. These behavioral features — consistent exercise, low substance use, and high academic performance — align with lower CES-D scores in the population correlations provided.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a robust, regular daily rhythm and active daytime physiology. Non-parametric and autocorrelation rhythm metrics (interdaily stability z ≈ 0.75; autocorrelation at 24h z ≈ 1.06) and a relatively large cosinor amplitude (z ≈ 1.54) indicate well-entrained and high-amplitude heart rate rhythms. Resting heart rate is modestly below population mean (60.2 bpm, z ≈ 0.24 interpreted as typical-to-favorable), and the aggregated hourly deviations show expected nocturnal heart rate suppression with a pronounced daytime/evening peak (notably a large deviation at 5–6 pm, z ≈ 2.47). Together these patterns reflect strong daily structure and pronounced daytime physiological activation, both of which are generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden or greater behavioral activation.

Sleep metrics present a mixed signal. Objective median nightly sleep duration is just under 7 hours (6 h 59 m, z ≈ -0.25), with moderate night-to-night variability in duration and start time (≈92–93 minutes SD, z values near 0). The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈1:05 AM). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7, classified as “disturbed sleep”) exceeds the common clinical cutoff for poorer sleep. Subjective sleep disturbance combined with a delayed sleep schedule and somewhat reduced self-reported happiness could contribute to transient daytime symptoms; however, objective sleep quantity and overall rhythm regularity are not markedly disrupted. The correlations between sleep variability and CES-D are small in the dataset, so while subjective sleep complaints are relevant, they are not determinative here.

Weighing all sources holistically: strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, frequent exercise, robust circadian rhythm and daytime physiological activation, excellent academic functioning, and minimal substance use) predominate. Adverse signals are limited to subjective sleep disturbance, somewhat reduced current happiness, and moderate perceived stress, which could represent situational or transient symptomatology rather than a high baseline depressive burden. Given the balance of large protective factors and only modest risk indicators, the overall profile is more consistent with a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

45076,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed psychological profile with both risk and protective features relevant to depressive symptomatology. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z ≈ 0.27) and markedly elevated perceived stress (PSS = 29; Z = 2.01), both of which are associated with higher CES-D scores in this sample (STAI–CES-D r = 0.81, PSS–CES-D r = 0.28). Current self-reported happiness is below the sample median (score = 3; Z ≈ -0.53), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is just above the common clinical threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), suggesting some subjective sleep-related difficulties. At the same time, the participant reports comparatively high self-esteem (Rosenberg score with Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (alone and with others, three times/week or more; Z-scores > 1), low substance use, and modest social engagement (1–2 hours socializing). These self-report patterns describe concurrent stress and anxiety signals that tend to elevate depressive symptoms, together with several robust behavioral protective factors (high self-esteem, regular exercise, low substance use) that tend to mitigate such symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics provide complementary insight. Objective nocturnal sleep duration is around 7 hours 38 minutes (median; Z = 0.56), with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 96 minutes), and relatively few naps—indicative of adequate sleep quantity despite the participant’s mildly disturbed subjective sleep. Sleep onset is late-median (≈ 00:57) but not highly irregular (start-time SD ≈ 63 minutes). Circadian summary measures from heart rate show modestly reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.74) and a small increase in intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.32), suggesting somewhat less regular day-to-day rhythm and mild within-day fragmentation; amplitude of the fitted rhythm is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.44). Resting heart rate is low (≈ 58 bpm) and hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced afternoon peak (notably 4–5 PM). Importantly, many wearable circadian and heart-rate metrics have small correlations with CES-D in this dataset (most r values near 0), indicating limited predictive weight here compared with the self-report anxiety/stress and self-esteem measures.

Integrative interpretation: the participant exhibits notable stress and anxiety signals that are empirically linked to higher depressive symptoms in this population, but these are counterbalanced by several strong protective indicators—especially elevated self-esteem and frequent structured exercise—which in this sample are strongly associated with lower CES-D (self-esteem–CES-D r ≈ -0.71; exercise behaviors show modest negative correlations). Objective sleep duration and low substance use further support lower risk for elevated depressive symptoms. Circadian metrics indicate some irregularity and lower amplitude that can be associated with mood disturbance, but those signals are modest in magnitude and have weak associations with CES-D here.

Weighing the totality of evidence, the profile is heterogeneous but leans toward relatively lower-to-average depressive symptom burden: elevated stress and anxiety increase risk, but the participant’s comparatively high self-esteem, consistent exercise habits, adequate objective sleep duration, and low substance use are substantial protective factors that reduce the likelihood of a high CES-D relative to the study sample. On balance, the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half (lower/median range) of CES-D scores in this study population.

44872,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"Self-report measures indicate a profile more consistent with relatively low depressive symptom burden. The participant reports high momentary well-being (Happy = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and above-average self-regard (SelfEsteem Z = 0.68), and an anxiety-proneness score on the STAI that is near or slightly below the study mean (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23; classified “not anxious”). Health satisfaction is high (6/7, Z = 1.3), and engagement in social activity (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = 0.95) and routine exercise (exercised alone and with others ≥ 3×/week, Zs ≈ 1.1–1.2) are both above the sample average—features that, in this dataset, are associated with lower CES-D scores (negative correlations for SelfEsteem, Happy, exercise, and socializing). Academic performance is high (GPAs ~3.8–3.93), which aligns with functional functioning rather than marked withdrawal or impairment.

There are, however, a few self-report signals associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality crosses the commonly used PSQI threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38). Alcohol use is frequent (beer and wine/liquor reported three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.7), which is a behavioral feature that in some contexts co-occurs with mood symptoms, though in this sample alcohol measures show minimal correlation with CES-D. These features represent modest risk indicators but are numerically smaller and/or have weaker CES-D correlations than the protective signals noted above.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep show a generally intact daytime circadian signal but with some variability in sleep timing. Heart-rate cosinor metrics show a relatively low MESOR (61.8 bpm, Z = -1.65) and a low resting heart rate (48.3 bpm, Z = -1.17), consistent with a low baseline cardiovascular tone rather than agitation. Amplitude is near average-to-slightly-low (Z = -0.13), and acrophase is mid-afternoon (2:42 PM), indicating a typical daytime peak. Nonparametric circadian regularity is reduced: interdaily stability is below average (0.29, Z = -0.99) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -1.37), suggesting less day-to-day consistency in the heart rate rhythm. Intradaily variability is only modestly elevated (Z = 0.46). Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime increases; several daytime hours (10 AM–1 PM and 5–6 PM) show large positive deviations (Z > 3) consistent with clear daytime activity bursts rather than blunted diurnal variation.

Sleep quantity is near the sample median (median nightly duration ≈ 6 h 58 m, Z = -0.27) but sleep timing is variable: night-to-night sleep start time SD is high (154 minutes, Z = 1.55) and sleep duration SD is elevated (135 minutes, Z = 0.77). In this dataset the variability measures (sleep start SD, sleep duration SD, and mean daily naps) have small positive correlations with CES-D (≈ 0.2–0.23), indicating that the participant’s labile sleep schedule is a modest signal toward higher depressive symptoms, even though average sleep duration is not markedly reduced.

Integrating modalities: protective indicators (high current happiness, higher self-esteem, frequent social activity and exercise, high health satisfaction, low trait anxiety, and intact daytime physiological peaks) are more numerous and/or have stronger associations with lower CES-D scores than the risk indicators (subjective disturbed sleep, variable sleep timing, modest perceived stress, and frequent alcohol use). The wearable-derived circadian irregularity and sleep-timing variability are the principal objective signals that point toward some vulnerability for elevated depressive symptoms, but their correlations with CES-D are modest and the participant’s other psychosocial measures are consistently in the direction associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Weighing the totality of evidence—psychological self-report, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiology—the balance favors placement in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms (i.e., not among those with the highest CES-D scores). The protective, low-depression–associated indicators are predominant and of appreciable magnitude (e.g., Happy Z = 1.64; Health Satisfaction Z = 1.3), while the risk indicators are smaller or have weaker correlations to CES-D.

27306,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Psychological trait and symptom profile: Self-report measures indicate a generally low-to-moderate affective symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is below the sample mean (score 37, z ≈ -0.4) and described as “not anxious,” which—given the strong positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D in the sample—argues against a high depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is notably elevated relative to the cohort (Rosenberg z ≈ +1.66) and has a sizable negative correlation with CES-D; this is one of the strongest protective signals in the dataset. Momentary happiness is slightly below the population mean (z ≈ -0.5) and perceived stress is near average (PSS z ≈ -0.17), which could reflect transient low mood or situational stress but not a pattern of marked affective disturbance by itself. Together, the trait-level indicators (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high health satisfaction) point toward relatively lower risk for pronounced depressive symptomatology.

Lifestyle, social and behavioral markers: The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising three times per week or more both alone and with others; z-scores > +1), very low substance use, and high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction z ≈ +1.8). These behaviors and attitudes are generally associated with reduced depressive symptoms in the literature and in the sample-level correlations provided. Recreational screen time, music listening, and other sedentary hobbies are minimal relative to peers (large negative z-scores), and socializing time is slightly below average (z ≈ -0.6), suggesting the participant is relatively active but with somewhat constrained social recreational exposure. The combination of frequent exercise, low substance use, and high health satisfaction is more consistent with lower CES-D scores than with elevated depressive symptomatology.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Subjective sleep quality is classified as “good” (PSQI score 4, z ≈ -1.26), and objective sleep metrics from the wearable show a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 h 42 min (z ≈ -0.6), with modest night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 84 min, z ≈ -0.37). Sleep start time is close to midnight (median 23:55) with moderate timing variability. These sleep indicators do not show the pronounced insomnia or hypersomnia patterns often associated with higher depressive symptom scores; on balance they are either near-sample-average or slightly protective. Daytime napping is negligible.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm signals: Heart-rate based circadian metrics indicate a relatively low overall mesor and low resting heart rate (mesor z ≈ -1.5; resting HR z ≈ -1.4), consistent with higher cardiovascular fitness. Amplitude is modestly above average (z ≈ +0.46) and the acrophase is mid-day (about 1:53 PM), indicating a pronounced diurnal rise in cardiovascular activity with clear morning and late-afternoon peaks (very large positive deviations at 7–8 AM and especially 4–5 PM). Interdaily stability is slightly below average and intradaily variability slightly above average, but neither deviation is large. There is no physiological signature here of a flattened diurnal rhythm or pervasive autonomic hyperarousal that would strongly point toward elevated depressive symptom burden; if anything, the robust activity peaks and low resting HR align with an active, physically fit pattern.

Integration and inference about depressive symptom burden: Across domains the most salient signals are protective: low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, frequent exercise, low substance use, good subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, and objective indicators of physical fitness (low resting heart rate, clear diurnal activity peaks). The few mildly concerning signals—slightly lower momentary happiness, modestly reduced social recreation relative to peers, and small increases in intradaily variability of heart rate—are modest in magnitude and do not outweigh the multiple protective indicators. Given the pattern of strong protective traits and behaviors and the absence of substantial sleep, psychophysiological, or anxiety-related risk markers, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s CES-D score is likely in the lower half of the study distribution.

46365,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Psychological trait and self-report indicators: The participant presents a mixed profile of affective and cognitive self-reports. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 45, Z ≈ 0.37) is modestly elevated relative to the sample and is strongly positively associated with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81), which would point toward higher depressive symptom burden if interpreted in isolation. Countervailing this, the participant’s self-esteem is at the upper bound of the scale (Rosenberg = 40, Z ≈ 0.26) and self-esteem correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ −0.71), a robust signal associated with lower depressive symptoms. Current self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are both below the sample average (happiness Z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ −1.45), and these scales correlate negatively with CES-D (higher satisfaction/happiness → lower CES-D), so these low scores provide modest evidence toward greater symptom burden. Perceived stress (PSS = 20) is near the study average (Z ≈ −0.44) and shows only a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.28), indicating limited additional information about depressive symptoms beyond the anxiety/self-esteem contrast.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports a pattern of frequent in-person social engagement (socializing with friends >4 hours/day, Z ≈ 2.53) and high Internet use (>4 hours/day, Z ≈ 2.19). High social time is typically protective for mood and here shows essentially no correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ −0.01), while greater internet use has a modest positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.26). Alcohol use (beer three times/week or more, Z ≈ 1.72) is elevated relative to peers but shows negligible correlation with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ −0.05). Exercise and sports participation are present at modest levels (sports 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 0.91), which is generally associated with lower depressive symptoms, although correlations in this dataset are small. Overall, the behavioral profile suggests an active social life and engagement in sports but also higher screen time; these behaviors pull in opposite directions with respect to likely depressive symptom burden.

Sleep and circadian/physiological metrics: Objective sleep duration is within a typical range (median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 16 min, Z ≈ 0.11) and self-reported PSQI is at the conventional threshold for acceptable sleep (PSQI = 5, classified here as “Good Sleep”), both of which provide little evidence for elevated depressive symptoms. However, sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:34), and Fitbit-derived heart-rate features show elevated heart rate deviations in the late-night window (notably 11pm–1am with high Z-scores at 11–12pm and 12–1am) suggesting relatively higher physiological arousal late at night. Circadian regularity metrics indicate lower interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation (Zs ≈ −0.9 to −1.37), consistent with reduced day-to-day regularity in heart-rate rhythms; these circadian features have only weak correlations with CES-D in this sample. Resting heart rate is modestly below average (55.8 bpm, Z ≈ −0.28) and overall mesor/amplitude do not point strongly toward dysregulated physiology. In sum, sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality are adequate, but late timing and some signs of late-night physiological arousal could be relevant to mood, albeit with small-to-modest links to CES-D in the available correlations.

Integrated interpretation and likely CES-D placement: The dataset contains conflicting but interpretable signals. The strongest statistical predictors in this sample are trait anxiety (positive association with CES-D) and self-esteem (strong negative association). The participant shows a modestly elevated trait anxiety score but simultaneously very high self-esteem; these two large-magnitude predictors point in opposite directions. Additional self-report indicators (low health satisfaction, somewhat lower happiness) and behavioral features (high late-night arousal, substantial internet use) provide moderate supports for elevated symptoms, whereas normal sleep duration, active social engagement, regular sports participation, and maximal self-esteem provide evidence for lower symptom burden. Given the relative strengths of the associations in the sample (very strong negative association of self-esteem with CES-D and only moderate positive association of anxiety with CES-D), together with objectively adequate sleep duration, active social engagement, and no strong wearable-derived physiological markers of sustained dysregulation, the balance of evidence favors a CES-D level that is at or below the median of the study population rather than clearly in the upper half.

23287,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"The self-report profile indicates multiple protective psychosocial features against depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is below the study mean (STAI = 37, z ≈ -0.4), and trait anxiety in this study correlates strongly and positively with CES-D (r = 0.81), so the participant’s lower anxiety level is a robust indicator of relatively lower depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 38, z ≈ -0.03) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71); this is another substantial protective signal. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 3, z ≈ -1.7), perceived stress is below average (PSS z ≈ -1.0), and overall health satisfaction is relatively high (z ≈ +1.7) — each of these factors aligns with a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms based on their directions and the study correlations provided. Reported happiness is slightly below average (z ≈ -0.5), but that effect is modest relative to the stronger protective indicators above.

Behavioral and lifestyle data further support a lower symptom burden. The participant reports little to no substance use, exercises frequently (particularly exercising with others, z ≈ +1.2), and maintains high academic performance (GPA series 3.33–3.8). Socializing time is low (16–30 minutes, z ≈ -1.4), and internet use is relatively high (3–4 hours, z ≈ +1.5) — the latter has a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.26). Overall these behaviors present a mixed picture, but the exercise frequency and absence of substance use weigh toward lower risk, while elevated solitary screen time and limited socializing are modest risk signals.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics are consistent with relatively healthy sleep and circadian functioning. Median nightly sleep duration is long compared with the sample (8 h 23 min, z ≈ +1.5), sleep timing is fairly consistent (median sleep start ≈ 00:56 with modest variability), and night-to-night sleep variability is not extreme (SD z ≈ +0.7). Napping frequency is elevated (mean daily naps 0.25, z ≈ +2.1) and shows a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.22), which is a minor risk indicator but not necessarily determinative. Circadian rhythm summary metrics (interdaily stability, intradaily variability, autocorrelation at 24 h) are near the cohort mean, suggesting reasonably regular day–night structure in heart-rate rhythms.

Cardiovascular physiology from the wearable shows a low overall mesor and unusually low resting heart rate (mesor ≈ 57.8 bpm, z ≈ -2.2; resting HR ≈ 40.6 bpm, z ≈ -2.1), consistent with high aerobic fitness or vagal tone; resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.19), so the participant’s low resting HR is a slight protective indicator. Hourly heart-rate deviations show deep nocturnal declines and relatively pronounced evening peaks (notably late-evening hours with large positive deviations and high z-scores), which could reflect evening physiological activation or activity patterns but the correlations of those hourly deviations with CES-D are generally small and inconsistent. Overall amplitude and acrophase are within modest ranges and non-parametric rhythm measures do not indicate marked dysregulation.

Holistic assessment: the strongest and most predictive indicators in this dataset (trait anxiety and self-esteem) point toward relatively low depressive symptomatology for this participant. Multiple converging signals — low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, good subjective and objective sleep, regular circadian metrics, frequent group exercise, low substance use, and low resting heart rate — outweigh the modest risk signals (higher internet use, limited social time, increased napping, slightly reduced momentary happiness). Given the magnitude and direction of the high-weight correlates with CES-D provided in the dataset, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s CES-D score would likely fall in the lower half of the study population distribution.

28247,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"The participant’s self-report trait profile shows multiple signals commonly associated with elevated affective symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is high (score 61, Z = 1.95) and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), indicating that their chronic anxiety proneness is a strong predictor of higher depressive symptoms in this cohort. Self-esteem is lower-than-average (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which further increases the likelihood of concurrent depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) and self-reported current happiness is slightly above the mean (score 4.0, Z = 0.55), but the stronger trait-level markers (high anxiety, low self-esteem) dominate the psychological risk profile because of their larger magnitudes and higher correlations with CES-D.

Behavioral and social lifestyle indicators present a mixed pattern of risk and potential protective factors. The participant reports minimal exercise (very low frequencies; Z-scores approximately -1.2 to -1.6), which is a behavioral risk factor for higher depressive symptoms. Substance use is low, and academic performance appears strong (GPAs in the 3.5–3.92 range), both of which are generally protective or neutral with respect to CES-D. Notably, reported socializing time is high (more than 4 hours; Z = 2.53) and listening to music is frequent (more than 4 hours; Z = 2.06); high social engagement could be protective, whereas heavy solitary music listening can reflect diverse coping styles — these behaviors complicate simple interpretation but do not fully offset the trait risk signals. Low interpersonal trust (Z ≈ -1.1) and reduced health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.03) are additional small-to-moderate indicators aligned with greater symptom burden.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology indicate poor sleep regularity and dampened circadian structure. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 8, above typical clinical cutoff), and median nightly sleep duration (6 h 26 min, Z = -0.94) is below the sample mean. Sleep start times are late (median ≈ 01:03) and highly variable (sleep-start SD = 208 minutes, Z = 2.74), reflecting irregular timing. Wearable-derived circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.23, Z = -1.48) and elevated intradaily variability (0.76, Z = 1.51), alongside a relatively low heart-rate rhythm amplitude (Z = -1.61). These findings (irregular sleep timing, high within-day fragmentation, low circadian amplitude) are consistent with physiological patterns that, in prior work and in this sample, commonly accompany higher CES-D scores. However, correlations between some wearable circadian features and CES-D in this dataset are modest or near zero, so these objective signals should be interpreted as supportive rather than determinative.

Aggregate heart-rate and resting physiology show a modestly elevated resting heart rate (62.2 bpm, Z = 0.48) and a typical daytime acrophase (~4:08 PM). Hourly deviations from mesor reveal normal nocturnal heart-rate reductions and daytime rises (peaks mid-morning and late afternoon/evening). The wearable-derived MESOR is close to sample mean and amplitude is reduced; resting HR and MESOR have only small positive correlations with CES-D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.19), indicating limited direct predictive weight compared with the larger questionnaire-based signals.

Integrating multimodal evidence, the strongest contributors to predicted CES-D burden are the high trait anxiety and low self-esteem (both large Z-scores in magnitude and strongly correlated with CES-D), plus disturbed subjective sleep and marked irregularity in sleep timing and circadian structure. Behavioral data are mixed — strong social engagement and good academic performance provide partial protective context, but notably low physical activity and low trust/health satisfaction are additional risk contributors. Overall, the balance of psychological trait measures and sleep/circadian irregularities indicates a greater likelihood of elevated depressive symptom burden relative to the study population median. Based on the magnitude and direction of the most predictive measures, this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the CES-D distribution.

72806,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"Self-report psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 33; Z = -0.82) and relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 39; Z = 0.11), both of which have relatively strong correlations with CES-D in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.81; Self-esteem r ≈ -0.71) and therefore weigh meaningfully toward lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is near sample average (PSS = 21; Z = -0.17) and current self-reported happiness is modestly lower than average (happiness Z = -0.53), the latter having a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.46) and thus representing a signal in the direction of greater depressive symptoms. Alcohol and drug use are minimal and exercise is present at low-to-moderate frequency (exercising alone 1–2×/week, Z = 0.32), suggesting engagement in some health-supporting behaviors. Academic performance (GPA) is high. Overall, trait measures that most strongly predict CES-D in this dataset (trait anxiety and self-esteem) indicate a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms, while isolated subjective reports (some reduced happiness and lower health satisfaction) provide modest countervailing evidence.

Sleep and sleep-related wearable metrics: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate generally adequate and regular sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 34 min (Z = 0.47), sleep timing is moderately delayed with a median sleep start around 00:30 and modest night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 68 minutes, Z ≈ -0.32). PSQI score of 5 (Z = -0.80) classifies as borderline/good subjective sleep quality. Sleep variability is not elevated (duration SD Z = -0.36), and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps 0.13, Z = 0.7). These objective and subjective sleep indicators—adequate total sleep, moderate regularity, and low sleep disturbance—do not provide a strong signal of substantial depressive symptomatology.

Circadian and cardiac rhythm structure: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a relatively regular and robust daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is somewhat above average (0.47, Z = 0.50), intradaily variability is near the population mean (0.55, Z ≈ 0.03), and cosinor amplitude is above average (amplitude = 12.52, Z = 0.56). Resting heart rate and mesor are slightly lower than the sample mean (RHR = 56.4 bpm, Z = -0.21; mesor = 72 bpm, Z = -0.27). In this dataset, higher amplitude and greater rhythm regularity show weak negative associations with CES-D, while higher resting HR/mesor show small positive associations; the participant’s pattern (good stability, higher amplitude, lower resting HR) aligns with features associated with lower CES-D scores.

Hourly heart rate pattern and behaviorally-relevant fluctuations: Temporally aggregated hourly deviations from mesor show pronounced nocturnal dipping (large negative deviations between roughly midnight and 6:00 AM) and a pronounced positive deviation in the early evening (largest positive deviation at 6–7 PM: +25.34, Z = 2.22). The nocturnal dip and overall low resting HR suggest good nocturnal cardiovascular recovery. The pronounced early-evening elevation in heart rate (an unusually high positive deviation relative to the sample) could reflect consistent evening physical activity or recurrent arousal (e.g., exercise, commuting, social activity), not necessarily pathological arousal; its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is small and slightly negative (r ≈ -0.10), providing limited evidence that this pattern relates to depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and weighting of evidence: Weighing multiple data streams, the strongest predictors in this dataset (trait anxiety and self-esteem) point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Wearable data—regular circadian structure, healthy nocturnal dipping, adequate and stable sleep, and low resting heart rate—provide convergent physiological evidence consistent with relatively low CES-D scores. Moderate countervailing signals include somewhat lower self-reported current happiness and modestly lower health satisfaction, but these are weaker and less predictive in the context of the stronger trait and physiological indicators. On balance, the multimodal pattern is more consistent with CES-D scores in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

39146,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports a pattern of elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92) and modestly reduced momentary happiness (current happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53). Trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z ≈ 0.07) is described as “anxious” in classification and carries a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it an important indicator to consider; however, the participant’s STAI score is close to the sample mean rather than being highly elevated. Self-esteem is indicated as relatively high compared with the study population (RSES Z = 0.68) and is inversely correlated with CES-D in the sample (r = -0.71), which would be protective against higher depressive symptom burden. The PSQI score (5.0, Z = -0.8) falls at or just below commonly used cut points and is relatively favorable compared with peers, suggesting subjective sleep quality that is not strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptoms. Academic performance (GPA consistently ≈ 3.73–3.76) and health satisfaction (Z = 0.38) are both above average, which are additional signals of preserved functioning relative to the cohort.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular indices: Heart-rate–based circadian measures show a generally regular rhythm. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (value 0.46, Z = 1.15), and interdaily stability is modestly above average (Z = 0.42), both indicating consistent day-to-day structure in heart rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is modestly above average (Z = 0.53), but not extreme. MESOR and resting heart rate are slightly elevated relative to the sample (MESOR Z = 0.61; resting HR Z = 0.86), and both metrics show small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting a weak association between higher tonic cardiovascular activation and depressive symptoms in the sample. The participant’s acrophase (peak heart rate ~3:57 PM) and aggregated hourly deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime peaks; there is no indication of a markedly flattened or disrupted circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = 0.07). Overall, the wearable-derived circadian profile is more consistent with a stable daily rhythm than with marked circadian disruption.

Sleep behavior and variability: Objective sleep summaries indicate a median nightly duration of approximately 6 h 48 min (Z = -0.47), with low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 62 minutes, Z = -0.89). Median sleep start time is late (about 1:32 AM), with modest variability in start time (SD Z ≈ 0.01). The combination of slightly below-average sleep duration but low variability and a PSQI in the “good” range suggests relatively consistent sleep patterns, albeit shifted later into the night. In this dataset, objective median sleep duration shows minimal correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.0), and the relatively low variability in duration is more consistent with behavioral regularity than with the irregular sleep often associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Activity, social, and lifestyle behaviors: The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use) and limited exercise (exercising alone less than 1–2 times per month; exercising with others not at all), placing them toward the low end of physical activity in the cohort. Daily recreational habits include elevated time in video games (1–2 hours, Z = 2.47), listening to music (2–3 hours, Z = 1.13), and sedentary hobbies (1–2 hours, Z = 1.41). Time spent socializing with friends is moderate (1–2 hours, Z = 0.16). These patterns indicate higher sedentary/solitary recreational engagement combined with limited structured exercise. Correlations between these specific leisure behaviors and CES-D in the sample are modest (generally small positive correlations), so while they may be relevant contextually, they do not constitute strong predictors on their own.

Integration and interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Evidence pointing toward elevated depressive symptomatology includes relatively high perceived stress and lower current happiness, a near-mean (but classified as anxious) STAI score which is notable because STAI is strongly correlated with CES-D in this cohort, and slightly elevated resting heart rate and MESOR (small positive CES-D correlations). Countervailing evidence includes favorable subjective sleep quality (PSQI), consistent objective sleep (low night-to-night variability), strong academic performance, above-average self-esteem (a strong inverse correlate of CES-D), regular circadian rhythmicity (high 24-hour autocorrelation and modest interdaily stability), absence of substance use, and preserved social time. Most of the strongest statistical associations with CES-D in this dataset (notably the STAI and self-esteem correlations) are partially offset in this participant’s profile: trait anxiety is only mildly above average while self-esteem is meaningfully above average.

Overall assessment and ranking relative to the study distribution: Balancing the multimodal evidence, the participant shows a mixed profile with some signals that align with elevated depressive symptoms (higher perceived stress, reduced momentary happiness, limited exercise, late sleep timing, slightly elevated resting HR) but several notable protective or neutral indicators (good subjective sleep, low sleep variability, high self-esteem, strong academic functioning, structured circadian rhythm, minimal substance use). Given the strength of protective indicators (particularly self-esteem and behavioral regularity) and the fact that the strongest predictor in the dataset (trait anxiety) is not markedly elevated for this individual, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) and an elevated self-esteem score relative to the study sample (RSES Z = 1.38). Perceived stress is near sample average (PSS Z ≈ -0.17) and subjective sleep quality is relatively good (PSQI = 3, Z = -1.72). Health satisfaction is above average (Z = 1.22) and current self-reported happiness is modestly below the sample mean (Z = -0.53). Together, the large negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D (r = -0.71) and the low STAI score (STAI–CES-D r = 0.81) provide converging self-report evidence that, on trait indices, this participant is more likely to have lower rather than higher depressive symptoms.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology from the wearable further support a pattern associated with lower depressive symptomatology. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration (8 h 42 min) is substantially longer than the cohort median (Z = 1.88) and subjective sleep quality is reported as good; sleep timing is consistent (sleep start SD ≈ 55 minutes, Z ≈ -0.6) and mean daily napping is absent. Circadian heart-rate metrics indicate a strong, regular rhythm: relatively high interdaily stability (Z = 1.49), high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.65), low intradaily variability (Z = -1.24), and a sizeable amplitude (Z = 1.59). The participant’s nocturnal heart-rate suppression (largest deviations from mesor between ~1–4 AM) and clear daytime peaks (largest deviations ~1–3 PM) indicate a well-entrained diurnal pattern. These objective markers (stable rhythm, low fragmentation, good sleep duration/consistency) are generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden in population studies.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are mixed but tend toward protective factors. The participant reports minimal substance use, minimal recreational drug use, and high academic performance (GPA consistently ≈3.9+). Social activity is modest (1–2 hours socializing), while exercise and sports participation are low (exercising alone/with others 1–2 times a month; sports not at all). Low physical activity is a risk factor for elevated depressive symptoms, but in this case other markers (high self-esteem, good sleep, low anxiety, high health satisfaction) offset that concern. Objective physiological indices that correlate modestly with CES-D (resting heart rate and mesor positive but small correlations: r ≈ 0.19–0.20) are mildly elevated relative to the population (resting HR Z = 0.55; mesor Z = 1.0) but the magnitudes are small and should be interpreted cautiously in the presence of stronger psychosocial indicators.

Holistic synthesis and ranking decision: weighing convergent evidence (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, good subjective and objective sleep, stable circadian rhythms, low substance use, high health satisfaction, high academic performance) against limited contrary signals (lower current happiness, low exercise frequency, mildly elevated HR mesor), the preponderance of data supports a relatively low to average depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. Therefore it is most consistent that this participant’s CES-D score falls in the bottom half of the cohort distribution.

Trait anxiety on the STAI is below the sample mean (score 33; z = -0.82) and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), which makes this a potent protective signal against elevated depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is at the maximum range for the scale (RSES = 40; z = 0.26) and is strongly inversely associated with CES-D (r = -0.71), another robust protective indicator. Current self-rated happiness is high (5.0; z = 1.64; CES-D correlation r = -0.46). Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 22; z = 0.10; r = 0.28), so stress is not markedly elevated. Taken together, trait and momentary self-report measures (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness) provide convergent evidence favoring relatively low depressive symptomatology.

Sleep and sleep-related subjective reports: The participant reports objectively adequate median sleep duration on the wearable (7 h 24 min; z = 0.28) but also shows greater night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start SD z = 1.12; sleep duration SD z = 0.61). Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed on the PSQI (score = 8; z = 0.59). Correlations provided indicate small-to-moderate positive associations between sleep variability/disturbance and CES-D (e.g., sleep SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep-start variability r ≈ 0.22), so the participant’s sleep irregularity and elevated PSQI introduce modest risk for higher depressive symptoms. However, the absolute median sleep time and only modestly elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps z = 0.61) mitigate the risk implied by the PSQI and variability measures.

Circadian and wearable-derived physiological patterns: Cosinor and nonparametric circadian metrics present a mixed picture. The mesor (58.35 bpm) and resting heart rate (45.6 bpm) are well below sample means (mesor z = -2.13; RHR z = -1.49). Given the weak positive correlations between mesor/RHR and CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), lower average heart rate here aligns with lower depressive symptom risk. Intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.75; z = 1.44), indicating greater fragmentation of hourly heart-rate patterns, but its correlation with CES-D is negligible (r ≈ -0.05), so its relevance to depressive symptoms in this dataset is limited. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are below-average (z = -0.90 and -0.61 respectively), suggesting somewhat less day-to-day regularity; again, correlations with CES-D are near zero to small. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced nighttime decreases in heart rate (large negative deviations during 12–6am; many z ≤ -1) and large positive morning peaks (7–9am z up to 3.24), consistent with a pronounced nocturnal decline and a strong morning activation. Overall, the wearable physiology is largely consistent with robust parasympathetic tone and morning arousal, which on balance does not point strongly toward higher depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral, social, and lifestyle context: The participant reports minimal substance use (no beer, wine/liquor, or recreational drugs; z-scores strongly negative) and relatively frequent social exercise (exercising with others three+ times/week; z = 1.23), both of which are behaviorally protective. Academic functioning is high (GPA near 4.0) and health satisfaction is above average (z = 0.8); interpersonal trust is slightly above average (z = 0.18) and inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.41), again a protective signal. Recreational patterns indicate low engagement in many solitary sedentary leisure activities (e.g., little TV, music, reading) and modest internet use; internet use has a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.25) and thus offers a minor countervailing signal. Overall, social exercise, academic success, low substance use, and health satisfaction weigh toward lower depressive symptom burden.

Integration and weighting of evidence: The strongest statistical indicators in this dataset for CES-D come from trait anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem, both of which are highly correlated with CES-D and both of which are strongly favorable in this participant (low STAI, maximal self-esteem). Additional protective signals include high self-rated happiness, frequent social exercise, low substance use, high GPA, and low average heart rate/mesor. Risk signals are present but smaller in magnitude: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) and elevated night-to-night sleep timing variability, modest perceived stress near sample mean, and some circadian fragmentation on intradaily variability. Given the relative strengths of the correlations and z-scores, the large protective signals (particularly STAI and self-esteem) have more weight than the modest sleep and circadian irregularity signals.

Conclusion on CES-D distribution placement: Considering the relative magnitude and direction of the strongest predictors (very low trait anxiety, very high self-esteem, high happiness, favorable behavioral and academic context) against the smaller sleep- and rhythm-related risks, the balance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to have a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

59673,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Self-report trait and symptom measures indicate a profile with multiple protective features relevant to depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI z = -0.43) alongside relatively high self-esteem (SelfEsteem z = +1.66) and above-average momentary happiness (Happy z = +0.55). Academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.7–3.9) and interpersonal trust is elevated (Trust z = +1.15). Perceived stress is close to the study mean (PSS z = +0.10). Taken together, these self-report variables that are strongly inversely correlated with depressive symptoms (notably self-esteem r ≈ -0.71, trust r ≈ -0.41, happiness r ≈ -0.46) point toward lower-than-average depressive symptomatology rather than marked elevation.

Lifestyle and activity measures show mixed signals. The participant reports limited team sports participation and relatively infrequent exercise (exercise frequency z-scores near or slightly above average for solo/with-others exercise but sports z = -1.09), low engagement in social/leisure activities relative to peers (socializing z ≈ -0.62), little recreational drug use, and modest alcohol use. Low socializing and minimal sports participation are behavioral patterns associated with greater depressive risk in population studies, but these are offset by low substance use and adequate engagement in some recreational pursuits (music, internet use). Health satisfaction is low (z = -1.2), which may reflect somatic concerns or perceived physical well-being that can contribute to mood symptoms; however, overall lifestyle evidence is heterogeneous and does not uniformly indicate high depressive burden.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data show adequate average sleep duration but notable irregularity in timing. Median nightly sleep duration is moderately above the study median (7 h 37 m; z = +0.54), yet night-to-night variability is relatively large (sleep duration SD = 144 minutes; z = +0.98) and median sleep start time is late (01:21) with moderate variability. PSQI indicates disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, z = +0.59). These patterns—adequate mean duration but high variability and late bedtimes—are consistent with fragmented or shifted sleep schedules that can contribute to mood symptoms, and sleep disturbance measures tend to correlate positively with CES-D in the sample. Wearable nap frequency is slightly elevated (naps/day z = +1.27), which can reflect compensatory sleep behavior or variable daytime functioning.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics do not show a clear physiological signature of elevated depressive symptomatology. Resting heart rate is low-normal (57.2 bpm, z = -0.11) and central cosinor parameters (MESOR, amplitude) are near the study mean. Non-parametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability and intradaily variability) are also close to average, indicating preserved 24-hour structure. One notable element is reduced autocorrelation at 24 hours (z = -0.70), which suggests moderate inconsistency in the day-to-day pattern of heart rate rhythms; combined with the late and variable sleep timing, this points toward circadian irregularity rather than grossly blunted rhythmicity. Hourly deviations from the mesor reveal elevated relative heart rate around late evening (e.g., 12–1am z = +1.72) and greater daytime elevations in mid-afternoon to early evening hours, consistent with later activity and arousal timing.

Weighing the evidence holistically: multiple strong protective self-report indicators (particularly high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, higher happiness, strong academic functioning, and high interpersonal trust) argue for a relatively low CES-D score. Risk-relevant features—subjective sleep disturbance, high variability in sleep timing/duration, late sleep onset, lower health satisfaction, and reduced socializing/sports—do introduce some vulnerability for elevated depressive symptoms, but these are moderate in magnitude and partly offset by the stronger protective signals. Physiological measures do not show a clear depressive pattern (resting HR normal, circadian amplitude intact), though there is some circadian irregularity. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms rather than the upper half.

74899,17.0,0.727979274611399,"Self-report measures indicate multiple psychosocial risk factors associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 52, z = 1.06) and very high perceived stress (PSS = 30, z = 2.28); in this dataset STAI is strongly positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.81) and perceived stress shows a moderate positive relation (r = 0.28). Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 32, z = -0.87) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in this sample (r = -0.71), suggesting lower self-worth that is typically associated with higher depressive symptoms. Current self-rated happiness is below average (z = -0.53, r with CES-D = -0.46), which complements the anxiety/stress/self-esteem profile and points toward increased internalizing symptom burden.

Sleep-related data show both subjective disturbance and objectively short nocturnal sleep. The participant’s PSQI score classifies as disturbed sleep (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05), and the wearable-derived median sleep duration is short (5 h 58 min, z = -1.52). Sleep timing is markedly delayed (median sleep start ~02:25 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability. Although the dataset’s correlations between objective sleep duration and CES-D are negligible, the combination of disturbed subjective sleep, pronounced short sleep duration relative to the cohort, and late sleep timing constitutes a pattern commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms and daytime dysfunction.

Behavioral and social habits present a mixed picture with some protective elements alongside isolation-leaning features. The participant exercises frequently (exercised alone three times per week, z ≈ 1.07), and alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2 times/week), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Time spent socializing (1–2 hours) and limited engagement in sedentary hobbies or videogames suggests some social contact but not extensive recreational buffering. Interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are relatively high (trust z = 1.79; health satisfaction z = 1.3), which may be protective against depressive symptoms; however, these do not fully offset the elevated anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem noted above.

Physiological and circadian indicators suggest a moderately active and somewhat irregular circadian/physiological profile. Heart-rate cosinor metrics show a higher-than-average mesor (HR mesor ≈ 80.9 bpm, z = 0.95) and modest amplitude (z = 0.54), with resting heart rate slightly above the cohort mean (62.1 bpm, z = 0.47). Non-parametric rhythm measures are near or slightly above average for fragmentation (intradaily variability z = 0.46) and stability (interdaily stability z = 0.17), indicating some within-day variability but not pronounced instability across days. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations reveal pronounced evening elevations (peak deviations in the 5–6 pm hour; e.g., 22.1 bpm, z = 1.69) and expected overnight reductions; these evening arousal peaks combined with late sleep timing may reflect delayed or shifted daily activity/arousal patterns that can be associated with mood symptoms. Correlations between most wearable-derived circadian metrics and CES-D in this dataset are small, so physiological signals are secondary but consistent with heightened arousal.

Integrative assessment and relative placement of depressive symptom burden: convergent evidence from this participant’s profile—strongly elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, below-average self-esteem, reduced self-reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and objectively short nocturnal sleep—collectively align with patterns that in this cohort are associated with higher CES-D scores (notably the very strong STAI–CES-D correlation and substantial negative self-esteem–CES-D correlation). Some behavioral and social factors (regular exercise, elevated trust and health satisfaction, low substance misuse) are mitigating influences, but they appear insufficient to counterbalance the magnitude of internalizing risk markers. On balance, the multimodal evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the study distribution for CES-D scores.

35011,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"Self-report profile and affective symptoms: The participant’s self-report measures largely indicate relatively low internalizing symptomatology and adaptive self-evaluations. Trait anxiety (STAI = 36, Z = -0.52) is below the sample mean and the STAI’s strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.82) suggests this low anxiety score is a robust indicator of lower depressive symptom burden in this case. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the cohort (RSES Z = 0.96) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), again supporting lower depressive symptomatology. Current happiness is modestly above average (Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is below average (PSS Z = -0.98); both of these patterns align with lower expected CES-D scores given their negative and positive correlations with CES-D, respectively. The PSQI score (7) indicates some subjective sleep disturbance, but its Z = 0.13 places it near the sample mean; taken together, the dominant signal from self-report is protective (lower anxiety, higher self-esteem, higher happiness, lower perceived stress), which points toward lower CES-D relative standing.

Sleep timing and quantity: Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a pattern of short and late sleep that may confer risk for mood symptoms despite the generally protective self-reports. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 5 min (Z = -1.37), indicating substantially shorter sleep than the study average. Sleep onset is markedly delayed (median start ~02:34), and night-to-night variability in sleep timing is moderate (SD ~70 minutes). Short sleep and very late bedtimes are features that have been associated with worse mood and greater depressive symptoms in many samples; however, in this dataset the CES-D correlations for sleep metrics are small or null. Thus the sleep pattern constitutes a physiobehavioral risk factor that is discordant with the participant’s more favorable self-reported affective profile.

Circadian and activity regularity: Circadian stability metrics derived from heart rate indicate reduced daily regularity and lower circadian amplitude. Interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.13, Z = -1.62), while intradaily variability is elevated (0.74, Z = 1.37). Amplitude of the fitted heart-rate rhythm is reduced (4.29, Z = -2.10). Together these findings indicate a flatter, less regular heart-rate circadian rhythm with more fragmented within-day transitions. Such circadian disruption and reduced amplitude are commonly associated with poorer mood and sleep, but within this dataset the circadian metrics show only weak correlations with CES-D (r values near zero to small magnitudes). Thus circadian irregularity appears as a notable physiological risk signal that is not strongly weighted by the sample-level CES-D associations.

Cardiovascular baseline and diurnal patterning: The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the study population (RHR = 77.6 bpm, Z = 2.31; mesor = 86.67, Z = 1.74). Elevated resting heart rate and higher mesor can indicate higher autonomic arousal or lower cardiorespiratory fitness; their modest positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19) point toward a small association with higher depressive symptoms in the cohort. Hourly aggregate deviations reflect a typical overnight nadir and daytime peaks, with an evening acrophase (~5:46 PM); there are no large CES-D–linked hourly deviations evident from the provided correlations. Overall, the cardiovascular profile shows physiological markers that modestly align with higher depressive symptom risk, but these associations are weaker than the protective self-report indicators.

Behavioral and social patterns: Reported social and activity behaviors are mixed. The participant reports low frequencies of exercise (1–2 times per month solo and with others) and reduced time socializing with friends (Z = -0.62), which are behavioral features that can be linked to higher depressive symptoms. Alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0) is above average relative to the cohort but shows minimal correlation with CES-D in this sample. Recreational drug use is absent. Overall, reduced socializing and low exercise frequency represent behavioral risk elements that contrast with the relatively favorable self-reported affective profile.

Synthesis and relative weighting of evidence: The data present a mixed multimodal picture. Self-report affective indices (low trait anxiety, elevated self-esteem, higher happiness, lower perceived stress) are strongly associated with lower CES-D scores based on sample correlations and are the clearest indicators in this dataset. In contrast, objective wearable measures (short sleep duration, very late sleep timing, low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, low circadian amplitude, and elevated resting heart rate) point toward physiological and behavioral patterns that have been linked to higher depressive symptomatology in prior work; however, within this cohort those wearable-derived features show generally small correlations with CES-D and therefore carry less predictive weight here than the strong self-report signals. Behavioral indicators such as low exercise and reduced socializing add modest risk information but are not as influential as the strong protective self-report metrics.

Assessment of CES-D distribution placement: Evidence for lower CES-D (bottom 50): Multiple self-report measures that correlate strongly with CES-D (low STAI, high self-esteem, greater happiness, low perceived stress) consistently indicate lower depressive symptom burden. These measures have large sample correlations with CES-D and the participant’s Z-scores on these measures are meaningfully in the protective direction. Evidence for higher CES-D (top 50): Wearable-derived signals—short sleep (Z = -1.37), very late sleep timing, low interdaily stability (Z = -1.98), low circadian amplitude (Z = -2.10), and elevated resting heart rate (Z = 2.31)—are notable physiological/behavioral risk markers; however, in this dataset their correlations with CES-D are small-to-modest, and several key circadian metrics show near-zero correlations with CES-D. Holistic judgment: weighing the relatively large, CES-D–relevant self-report effects more heavily than the weaker wearable–CES-D associations, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s depressive symptom burden is likely in the lower half of the study distribution.

89710,39.0,0.9818652849740933,"Trait and symptom self-report profile: The participant reports markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z = +1.35) and substantially lower self-esteem (RSES = 25, z = -1.85). Both of these measures have strong correlations with CES-D in the study sample (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self‑esteem r ≈ -0.70), indicating that these two signals are among the most powerful survey-based predictors of higher depressive symptom burden in this dataset. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, z = +1.52), and momentary affective indicators also point toward lower well-being (self-reported happiness = 2.0, z = -1.61; health satisfaction z = -1.7). Together, these self-report indicators—high anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, and reduced positive affect—are consistent with a profile that aligns with elevated CES‑D scores in this population.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian features: Fitbit-derived sleep shows a median nightly duration of 6 h 44 min (z = -0.56), which is modestly shorter than average, with considerable variability in sleep onset (median start ~01:25 AM; start-time SD z = +1.09). Night-to-night sleep timing irregularity combined with a PSQI indicating subjectively disturbed sleep suggests both quantitative and qualitative sleep disruption. Circadian metrics from heart rate further indicate reduced rhythm regularity and amplitude: interdaily stability is low (value 0.22, z = -1.56) and cosinor amplitude is reduced (z = -1.04). These features (irregular sleep timing and lower circadian amplitude/stability) are biomechanical patterns frequently associated with greater mood symptom burden and vulnerability to depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and activity context: Daily behavior patterns show high solitary digital engagement (internet use and listening to music both show high z-scores > +2.0) and limited vigorous social or solitary exercise (exercise alone infrequent; social exercise more common but moderate). Alcohol and drug use are low-to-moderate (no beer, wine 1–2×/week), so substance use does not appear to be a primary driver. Socializing is present but not particularly elevated (1–2 hours). The combination of elevated online/media engagement, low self‑reported happiness, and reduced interpersonal trust (z ≈ -1.74) suggests behavioral patterns consistent with social withdrawal or reduced perceived social support—patterns that often co-occur with higher depressive symptom indices.

Physiological arousal pattern and integrative interpretation: Resting heart rate is near the sample mean (58.2 bpm, z ≈ 0.01), so baseline autonomic tone is not strongly deviant. Hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and afternoon/evening peaks; notable is a relatively large evening deviation around 5–6 pm (value +20.3, z ≈ +1.43), which may indicate periods of elevated physiological activation in late afternoon/early evening but is not by itself a specific marker of depressive symptom severity. Taken together, however, the strongest and most diagnostic signals in this case are the self-report measures (especially high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem) and the disrupted sleep/circadian organization. Given the high inter-study correlations of these particular measures with CES‑D, the multimodal pattern converges on elevated depressive symptomatology rather than on a low/average symptom burden.

Synthesis and overall CES‑D group assignment: Evidence for higher CES‑D (top half) — strong: STAI score substantially above the sample mean (z = +1.35) with very high correlation to CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81); markedly low self‑esteem (z = -1.85) with strong negative correlation to CES‑D (r ≈ -0.70); poor subjective sleep (PSQI z = +1.52); low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.6 to -1.7). Evidence for lower/average CES‑D (bottom half) — weaker: near-average resting HR and modestly short but not severely curtailed objective sleep duration (median ~6 h 44 m, z ≈ -0.56). Balancing these signals, the preponderance of high-weight predictors (anxiety and self-esteem, plus poor subjective sleep and marked behavioral patterns) points to a CES‑D score in the upper half of the study distribution.

97596,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"Self-report measures indicate a pattern of elevated internal distress that is relevant to depressive symptom burden. The participant's trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is elevated and has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.82), which is one of the single strongest survey predictors of higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also high (PSS = 32, Z = 2.83; r with CES-D = 0.27), and the participant reports low current happiness (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61; r = -0.46). Self-esteem is in the upper range (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31) and represents a modest protective factor given its strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), but on balance the combination of elevated trait anxiety, high perceived stress, and low reported happiness points toward increased risk for higher CES-D scores.

Sleep data show a notable objective–subjective discrepancy. Fitbit-derived sleep quantity and regularity are relatively favorable (median nightly duration 8 h 10 min, Z = 1.22; sleep duration SD = 60 min, Z = -0.92; median sleep start ~00:31), indicating adequate duration and moderate night-to-night consistency. In contrast, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is markedly elevated (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), classified as disturbed sleep. This discordance—objective sufficiency of sleep duration but severe subjective sleep complaints—is commonly observed in mood and stress-related disturbances and is relevant because PSQI is associated with depressive symptoms; the extreme PSQI z-score here adds weight to concern about subjective sleep-related impairment despite apparently adequate sleep time.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian metrics are consistent with modest sympathetic arousal and some circadian fragmentation. Resting heart rate and mesor are slightly above the study mean (RHR = 63.6 bpm, Z = 0.65; mesor = 77.8, Z = 0.53), and intradaily variability is elevated (IV = 0.66, Z = 0.81) while interdaily stability is slightly below average (IS = 0.39, Z = -0.16). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, with relatively large positive deviations in the late afternoon/early evening (notably 5–7 pm). Correlations between these circadian/HR features and CES-D are small to modest in this dataset, but the pattern—elevated RHR/mesor and greater intraday variability—aligns with physiological arousal and reduced rhythm robustness that can accompany elevated depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors present a mixed picture with several protective elements. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.07) and moderate social activity (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = 0.95), low substance use, and good academic performance (GPAs in the mid-3.0s to 3.8). These behaviors are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. Conversely, high time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.06) and reduced interpersonal trust (Z = -0.78) may reflect or support mood-related regulation strategies and some social-cognitive strain, respectively. Overall, behavioral data provide partial mitigation against risk but do not fully offset the elevated subjective distress indicators.

Holistic synthesis and ranking: when weighting the strongest, most CES-D–relevant indicators, the participant shows multiple signals associated with higher depressive symptom burden—most notably elevated trait anxiety (STAI) with a very strong correlation to CES-D, high perceived stress, low current happiness, and severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI). Objective sleep duration and some adaptive behaviors (frequent exercise, social engagement, good GPA, relatively high self-esteem) are protective and reduce likelihood of extreme depressive scores, but they do not negate the pronounced subjective distress signals. On balance, the preponderance and strength of the CES-D–linked indicators support classification in the upper half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

57359,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Self-report measures indicate a generally low-to-moderate burden of internalizing symptoms and several protective psychosocial features. Trait anxiety (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23) is slightly below the study mean and the STAI–CES-D correlation in the sample is large (r ≈ 0.81), which suggests that this individual’s relatively low trait anxiety would be expected to correspond with lower depressive symptom scores. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 35, Z = -0.45) and has a strong negative association with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), again supporting a lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is below average (PSS score Z ≈ -0.71), and academic functioning appears strong (multiple GPAs near 4.0). Together these self-reported indices (lower-than-average anxiety and stress, higher-than-average self-esteem and academic performance) provide convergent evidence favoring lower CES-D scores relative to the study population.

Measures of subjective sleep and momentary affect provide a mixed signal but are not strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s PSQI score (6) crosses the commonly used threshold for disturbed sleep but is close to the cutoff (PSQI Z ≈ -0.33), suggesting only mild subjective sleep difficulties. Self-reported current happiness is modestly below average (Current Happy Z ≈ -0.53), which aligns with a small-to-moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.46) and would push in the direction of higher depressive symptoms. However, perceived stress and self-esteem patterns described above provide countervailing evidence. Overall, subjective sleep complaints and somewhat reduced momentary happiness are present but not large in magnitude relative to the sample.

Wearable-derived sleep, heart rate, and circadian metrics largely reflect regular rhythms, good sleep duration, and relatively low physiological arousal, which together argue against a high depressive symptom burden. Fitbit-recorded median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8h 8m; Z ≈ +1.18), and sleep timing is centered close to midnight (median sleep start ≈ 00:05) with moderate variability. Resting heart rate is low (52.3 bpm; Z ≈ -0.7) and mesor is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.41), while interdaily stability and intradaily variability are near the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.17 and -0.25, respectively). The cosinor-derived amplitude is modestly above average and acrophase falls in mid-to-late afternoon (≈4:00 PM), indicating a clear diurnal structure in heart-rate rhythms. The participant shows pronounced nightly heart-rate reductions and robust daytime increases (notably a strong morning elevation at 8–9 AM; Z ≈ +2.26), consistent with a consolidated nocturnal rest period and daytime activity. Most circadian and wearable heart-rate features display small correlations with CES-D in the sample, and the observed pattern (regular, consolidated sleep and relatively low resting heart rate) is more consistent with lower depressive symptom levels than with marked depression-related dysregulation.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators provide additional context consistent with relatively low depressive symptomatology. Exercise participation has a mixed pattern (organized sports 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +0.91; exercising alone infrequent), socializing with friends is occurring at typical levels (1–2 hours, Z ≈ +0.16), and substance use is moderate (alcohol use 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.0) with no recreational drug use. Mean daily naps are somewhat elevated (0.18 naps/day, Z ≈ +1.27), and nap frequency shows a modest positive correlation with CES-D in the sample; this is a minor risk indicator but, taken with the long nightly sleep and otherwise active social/academic profile, does not strongly indicate a high depressive symptom burden.

Weighing evidence for and against elevated CES-D scores: evidence supporting a low/median CES-D includes below-average trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, lower perceived stress, strong academic performance, consolidated and relatively long nocturnal sleep, low resting heart rate, and reasonably regular circadian rhythms. Limited risk signals include a PSQI just above the clinical cutoff, somewhat lower momentary happiness, and slightly elevated nap frequency. The magnitudes of the protective indicators (notably the strong STAI–CES-D and self-esteem–CES-D associations combined with the participant’s favourable scores on those measures) outweigh the modest risk markers. On balance, the multimodal profile is most consistent with a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

17308,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports a mixed but overall resilient self-report profile. Trait anxiety on the STAI is moderately elevated (score = 43, Z = 0.17) and perceived stress is above average (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92), both of which are risk-relevant features given their positive associations with depressive symptomatology. At the same time, global self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17) and current self-reported happiness is above the sample mean (Current Happy = 4.0, Z = 0.55). Health satisfaction is also elevated (5.33 on a 1–7 scale, Z = 0.8). Academically the participant has sustained strong GPAs (~3.7 across terms). Taken together, the self-report profile presents both risk indicators (elevated stress and some anxiety) and several protective indicators (higher self-esteem, subjective happiness, health satisfaction, and preserved academic performance).

Behavioral/lifestyle indicators: Behavioral habits are largely supportive of mental health. The participant exercises frequently (exercised alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) and reports minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and spirits 1–2 times per week). Daily recreational activities are generally low in sedentary screen time and socializing time is modest (socializing 16–30 minutes/day, Z = -1.41), suggesting limited daily peer interaction. Low sedentary hobbies and low nap frequency further indicate an active daytime routine. The combination of high exercise, low substance use, good perceived health, and preserved academic functioning are protective factors against depressive symptom burden; limited social time and elevated perceived stress constitute countervailing risks.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: Objective sleep metrics indicate generally adequate and stable nocturnal sleep. Median sleep duration is 7 h 27 min (Z = 0.33) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD = 64 minutes, Z = -0.84). Self-report PSQI of 5 falls at the conventional boundary of ""good"" versus ""disturbed"" sleep and the Z-score suggests better-than-average subjective sleep quality. Sleep onset is relatively late (median start ~01:18 AM) but sleep timing itself shows low variability (start-time SD Z = -1.02) and no habitual napping. These data imply consolidated but late sleep timing rather than fragmented or unstable sleep.

Physiological/circadian heart-rate features: Heart-rate–based circadian measures show a low MESOR (60.85 bpm, Z = -1.79) and low resting heart rate (47.2 bpm, Z = -1.3), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Amplitude is near typical (Z = 0.15) and acrophase around mid-late afternoon (4:37 PM). Nonparametric rhythm metrics show modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.37, Z = -0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is lower than average (Z = -0.53), suggesting some reduction in day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms even though sleep timing appears consistent. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced nocturnal decreases and strong daytime peaks (notably 10–11 AM and late afternoon), a pattern consistent with normal diurnal variation but with particularly marked daytime excursions relative to the participant’s low MESOR. Overall the physiological profile suggests preserved circadian structure with modest reductions in daily rhythmic consistency; physiological signs point toward good fitness rather than dysregulation commonly linked with severe depressive symptomatology.

Synthesis regarding depressive symptom burden (CES-D implications): Risk signals for higher depressive symptoms are present but relatively circumscribed—elevated perceived stress and modestly elevated trait anxiety are the primary concerns, and limited daily socializing could reduce protective social buffering. However, multiple protective indicators are salient: high self-esteem, above-average subjective happiness, sustained academic performance, frequent exercise, low substance use, adequate and regular sleep, and physiological markers of fitness (low resting HR and normal amplitude). Many of the wearable-derived metrics that have only weak correlations with CES-D in this sample (e.g., amplitude, intradaily variability) are near-average or favorable. Given the balance of risk and protective features, and given that the anxiety score is only slightly above the sample mean whereas several strong protective features are present, the aggregate evidence is more consistent with a lower-to-median depressive symptom burden rather than markedly elevated depressive symptoms.

Conclusion (grouping relative to study distribution): Considering the totality of self-report, behavioral, and physiological evidence, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for CES-D scores (bottom 50%).

51851,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report measures indicate a broadly low burden of internalizing symptomatology and several protective psychosocial resources. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI trait = 35, z = -0.62) is below the sample mean and the STAI–CES-D correlation in this dataset is large (r ≈ 0.81), so this lower-than-average anxiety score is a strong protective signal against elevated CES-D scores. Self-esteem is notably above average (RSES z = +1.1) and the self-esteem–CES-D correlation is large and negative (r ≈ -0.71), which further supports lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is slightly below average (PSS z ≈ -0.44) and overall health satisfaction is high (z ≈ +1.63), both of which are consistent with lower risk for elevated depressive symptoms. Conversely, the participant reports somewhat lower momentary happiness (current happiness z ≈ -0.53) and notably low interpersonal trust (z ≈ -1.42); these two features (especially lower happiness, which correlates moderately with CES-D, r ≈ -0.46) represent modest risk factors but are smaller in magnitude relative to the strong protective signals above.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are generally protective. The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others, and sports three times per week or more; exercise-related z-scores all > +1), which in this sample is weakly associated with lower CES-D (correlations small and negative). Social time is present (1–2 hours), recreational drug use is absent, and alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2 times per week). Leisure patterns include relatively high music listening (2–3 hours; z ≈ +1.13), which shows a small positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.25) and could reflect coping or mood-linked behavior, but the overall behavioral profile (high exercise, moderate social engagement, low substance use) is more consistent with lower depressive symptom load.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology give a mixed picture, with more signal on sleep disturbance than on extreme circadian disruption. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is close to seven hours (6 h 57 m; z ≈ -0.28), which is near the sample average, but the self-reported PSQI indicates clinically meaningful sleep-related complaints (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep; z ≈ +0.59). Sleep start time is relatively late (median start ≈ 00:56) with elevated night-to-night variability in bedtime (sleep start SD z ≈ +0.61). These subjective sleep problems and irregular bedtimes are modest risk indicators for depressive symptoms. Wearable circadian measures show reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.74) and elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.23), i.e., greater fragmentation of day–night heart rate patterns, but the correlations between these specific circadian metrics and CES-D are near zero in this sample, suggesting only weak direct weighting of these features for depression risk here.

Cardiovascular physiology suggests high fitness and a robust amplitude of day–night separation in heart rate, which generally aligns with lower risk. Resting heart rate is markedly low (RHR = 41.1 bpm, z ≈ -2.03), and MESOR is also low (z ≈ -1.90), which are typically seen in well-conditioned individuals; in this dataset higher heart rate metrics show small positive associations with CES-D, so the participant’s low resting HR is indirectly protective. Hourly aggregate deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal decreases and evening rises in heart rate; evening peaks are somewhat above average (e.g., 6–9 pm positive deviations, some z > +1), but correlations of these hourly deviations with CES-D are small and inconsistent. In sum, the physiological profile leans toward good cardiorespiratory fitness and does not provide strong evidence of elevated depressive symptomatology.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically, protective factors predominate. The strongest individual indicators in this profile—low trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D) and high self-esteem (strong negative correlate)—are both robust signals favoring lower depressive symptom burden. Frequent exercise, high health satisfaction, low perceived stress, and very low resting heart rate further support this interpretation. Risk signals—disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), somewhat lower momentary happiness, low interpersonal trust, and increased intradaily variability in heart rate—are present but smaller in magnitude and/or have weak associations with CES-D in this sample. On balance, the collective pattern of strong protective psychosocial characteristics, favorable lifestyle behaviors, and physiologic markers outweighs the modest risk indicators, making it more likely that the participant’s CES-D score falls in the lower half of the study distribution.

77872,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Psychological trait and self-report profile: The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) and relatively high self-regard (SelfEsteem Z = 0.82), both features that are strongly associated in this sample with lower CES-D scores (STAI correlation with CES-D = 0.81; self-esteem correlation = -0.71). Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17) and current happiness is slightly below average (Happy Z = -0.53), but overall subjective evaluations of physical health are comparatively positive (Health Satisfaction Z = 0.97), which is associated with lower depressive symptom burden in the cohort (correlation = -0.39). Taken together, the trait-level data show multiple protective indicators (low anxiety, high self-esteem, good health satisfaction) with only modest signals of affective low mood (slightly reduced momentary happiness).

Behavioral lifestyle and social activity: The participant reports limited team sports involvement (Sports Z = -1.09) and relatively low time spent socializing with friends (Socializing Z = -0.62), offset by frequent solitary sedentary hobbies and reading (Sedentary Hobby Z = 0.82; Reading Z = 1.30). Alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week, Z = 1.01) is present but recreational or non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise occurs (1–2×/week alone and with others, small positive Z-scores) but is not a dominant lifestyle feature. Reduced socializing and higher sedentary hobby time are behaviorally relevant risk features for mood in student samples, but in this case they coexist with other protective psychosocial traits (notably self-esteem and low trait anxiety).

Sleep quantity, timing, and subjective sleep quality: Objective sleep duration is slightly below the sample median (median = 6 h 50 min, Z = -0.44) but sleep quality by self-report is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Night-to-night variability in duration and timing is relatively low (sleep duration SD Z = -0.84; nap frequency Z = -0.86), indicating consistent sleep length and few naps. The participant’s habitual sleep start time is late (median start ≈ 01:58), which can be a behavioral risk factor for mood in student populations, but the overall combination of reasonably stable sleep, good subjective quality, and absence of fragmented sleep reduces the likelihood that sleep disturbances are driving elevated depressive symptoms here.

Circadian structure and cardiovascular indices: Heart-rate derived circadian measures show an organized rhythm with moderate-to-strong amplitude (Amplitude Z = 0.75) and a mesor slightly above the sample mean (Mesor Z = 0.65). Interdaily stability is near average (Z ≈ -0.08) and intradaily variability is relatively low (Z = -1.31), indicating a coherent, unfragmented daily pattern of physiological activity. Resting heart rate is within the sample average (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal nadirs through the early morning and daytime elevations with notable peaks in late afternoon/early evening; correlations of these hourly deviations with CES-D are minimal. Overall, the wearable-derived circadian and autonomic profile is consistent with intact, regular physiological daily rhythms—features typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Holistic assessment relative to study distribution: Balancing the modalities, the strongest evidence points toward relatively low current depressive symptom burden. High self-esteem and low trait anxiety are both large-sample predictors of lower CES-D scores in this dataset, and physiological markers (low intradaily variability, clear circadian amplitude, normative resting HR) align with those protective psychosocial indicators. Behavioral risks are present (late sleep timing, reduced socializing, some sedentary hobbies), and momentary happiness is slightly below average, but these signals are smaller in magnitude and correlate less strongly with CES-D in this sample than the protective traits. Given the preponderance of protective indicators and the strength of their associations with CES-D in the cohort, the overall balance of evidence indicates the participant’s CES-D score is more consistent with being in the lower half of the study distribution.

72348,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Summary of self-report traits and current affect:
The participant’s self-report profile indicates relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23) and moderately high self-esteem (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59), both characteristics that are associated with lower depressive symptom burden in this cohort (strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES‑D). Current affective indicators present a mixed picture: self-reported happiness is modestly below the sample mean (Current Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is near average (PSS = 22, Z = 0.1). Overall, trait measures lean toward psychological resilience while momentary mood variables show some mild negative affect.

Lifestyle, social behavior, and daily activities:
Behavioral reports show minimal substance use and limited engagement in organized or social exercise (exercise and sports frequencies well below the sample mean). The participant reports above-average time in sedentary and internet-based activities (Internet 3–4 hrs, Z = 1.52; Sedentary hobby 1–2 hrs, Z = 1.41; watching TV Z = 1.28). Time spent socializing is average-to-slightly-below-average. Low substance use and moderate health satisfaction argue against behavioral risk for depression, but low physical activity and high sedentary/internet time are mild behavioral correlates of elevated depressive symptoms in this population.

Objective sleep and circadian patterns:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a consistent, well-entrained pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 22 m, Z = 1.48) with low night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 39 min, Z = -1.4) and sleep onset timing (median start 23:44, start-time SD = 26 min, Z = -1.24). Circadian regularity metrics are strongly positive (interdaily stability Z = 1.99; 24-hour autocorrelation Z = 2.49) and intradaily fragmentation is low (intradaily variability Z = -0.81), indicating a stable day–night structure in physiological state across the recording period. These objective markers—regular timing, low variability, and sufficient duration—are generally protective against depressive symptomatology.

Subjective-objective sleep discrepancy:
Despite objective sufficiency and regularity, the participant’s PSQI score indicates subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59). This discrepancy—regular, adequate sleep on wearables but self-reported poor sleep quality—can reflect nonrestorative sleep, sleep fragmentation not captured by the summary statistics, or heightened sleep-related distress. Subjective poor sleep quality is more strongly associated with depressive symptoms than duration alone, so this inconsistency represents a modest risk signal that should be weighed against the objectively protective sleep pattern.

Physiological arousal and heart-rate features:
Cardiovascular summaries show a higher-than-average resting heart rate and mean HR mesor (RHR = 71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55; mesor Z = 1.69), with typical daytime increases and marked nocturnal decreases. Daytime acrophase occurs mid-afternoon (≈3:25 PM). Elevated resting HR and higher mesor have small positive correlations with CES‑D in this sample; combined with the participant’s otherwise regular rhythms, the elevated cardiac baseline suggests mild tonic autonomic arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness rather than circadian dysregulation per se.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
Putting the multimodal evidence together, protective features predominate: low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, strong and regular circadian rhythms, consistent and sufficient sleep duration, low substance use, and moderate health satisfaction. Risk signals are present but relatively modest: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI), limited physical activity, elevated sedentary/internet time, slightly reduced current happiness, and a higher resting heart rate. Correlations between several of these measures and CES‑D are small-to-moderate and do not outweigh the stronger protective indicators. On balance, the profile is more consistent with low-to-moderate depressive symptomatology relative to the cohort.

89607,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"Multimodal symptom synthesis — self-report and trait measures:
The participant shows a mixed profile on self-report measures with both risk-related and protective features relevant to depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 49, z ≈ 0.76) and is strongly correlated with CES-D in the study sample (r ≈ 0.81), indicating that this individual’s anxiety proneness is an important risk factor for higher depressive symptoms. At the same time, self‑esteem is at the maximum observed value (RSES = 40, z ≈ 0.26) and this measure is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), representing a substantial protective factor against depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is above average (z ≈ 0.55; r with CES‑D ≈ −0.46), and perceived stress is lower than the cohort average (PSS z ≈ −0.44), both of which support lower depressive symptomatology. Trust in others is somewhat low (z ≈ −0.46; r ≈ −0.41), a modest risk factor, but its magnitude here is smaller than the large opposing signals from self-esteem and happiness.

Behavioral patterns and lifestyle factors:
Behavioral data indicate generally active engagement in protective behaviors. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports (three times a week or more; exercise z-scores +1.07 to +1.58), which are weakly associated with lower CES‑D in the sample and would typically reduce risk. Socializing time is near average and recreational screen time (video games, sedentary hobbies) is elevated, which could modestly relate to sedentary behavioral patterns but showed only small correlations with CES‑D in this cohort. Substance use is limited (no beer, occasional wine), and non-prescribed drug use is absent. Academic performance shows some variability across terms but no direct CES‑D correlations are provided. Overall, lifestyle factors lean toward protective (high physical activity, reasonable social time) with some elevated sedentary leisure.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian, and physiological indicators:
Objective sleep and circadian markers present a largely regular and robust rhythm. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (≈8 h 12 m; z ≈ +1.26) with low night-to-night variability (sleep-duration SD z ≈ −0.81) and low variability in sleep start time (SD z ≈ −0.90). Mean daily naps are minimal but slightly above average (z ≈ +1.27). Circadian metrics from heart rate show high interdaily stability (0.56; z ≈ +1.24) and lower intradaily variability (z ≈ −0.67), indicating consistent day-to-day timing and low fragmentation of the heart‑rate rhythm — characteristics typically associated with better mood regulation. Cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude indicate a somewhat elevated baseline heart rate (mesor z ≈ +0.87) with modestly reduced amplitude (z ≈ −0.36). Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the cohort (68.6 bpm; z ≈ +1.24) and has a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting some physiological arousal that weakly tracks depressive symptoms. Aggregate hourly heart‑rate deviations show the expected large nocturnal declines and daytime peaks; these patterns appear stronger than average for several night and midday hours but overall the circadian structure is coherent.

Subjective sleep complaints versus objective sleep:
Although objective sleep duration and regularity are favorable, the participant’s PSQI indicates some subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep). This discrepancy — relatively long, regular sleep by wearable data but self-reported poor sleep quality — can be psychologically meaningful: subjective sleep dissatisfaction is often associated with mood symptoms even when objective metrics look adequate. The PSQI z-score is near the cohort mean, and its direct correlation with CES‑D is not large in the provided metrics, so it is a moderate consideration rather than a decisive signal.

Integrated assessment regarding depressive symptom burden:
Balancing the available evidence yields a mixed but overall lower-risk profile for CES‑D relative to the study population. The strongest single risk indicator is elevated trait anxiety (STAI), which has a large sample correlation with CES‑D and suggests vulnerability to higher depressive symptoms. However, multiple robust protective signals counterbalance that risk: maximal self‑esteem (a strong inverse correlate of CES‑D), above-average self-reported happiness, frequent physical activity, a consistent and regular circadian profile, and objectively long and stable sleep. Physiological signals (elevated resting HR and modestly elevated mesor) provide a small additional risk signal, and subjective sleep complaints provide a moderate risk signal, but both are smaller in magnitude and weaker predictors in the cohort than the major protective factors. Given the overall pattern — one prominent risk factor (trait anxiety) but multiple and somewhat stronger protective markers (very high self-esteem, regular circadian function, good objective sleep, frequent exercise, and positive affect) — the preponderance of evidence points toward a CES‑D score that is not in the high half of the distribution.

59900,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"Multimodal summary — self-report symptom and trait measures:
The participant’s self-report profile presents a mixture of strengths and localized difficulties. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 37, z = -0.43) is below the study mean and classified as “not anxious”; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), this single indicator substantially favors lower depressive symptom burden. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39, z = 0.11) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), which also points toward relatively lower depressive symptoms. Current self‑reported happiness is modestly above average (z ≈ 0.55) and perceived stress is below average (PSS = 19, z ≈ -0.71), both of which are consistent with lower levels of mood disturbance. Interpersonal trust is above average and health satisfaction is somewhat low (z ≈ -1.20), indicating some dissatisfaction with physical health but not a broad pattern of negative affect across measures.

Sleep and subjective sleep quality:
Subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 14, z = 3.37; “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating substantial perceived sleep problems during the reporting window. This subjective disturbance contrasts with some wearable-derived quantities (see below) and therefore suggests a mismatch between objective sleep timing/duration and perceived restorative sleep. Because PSQI is an established marker of sleep‑related distress, it represents an important signal for functional impairment even when other mood measures are relatively favorable.

Wearable-derived sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show long median sleep duration (median = 9 h 22 min; z ≈ 2.71) with high night‑to‑night variability in duration (SD ≈ 169 minutes, z ≈ 1.55) and variable sleep onset timing (median start ≈ 00:10, start SD z ≈ 1.19). The pattern is one of extended but irregular nocturnal sleep, with no recorded daily naps. In the context of affective symptoms, hypersomnia combined with high intraindividual sleep variability can be associated with elevated depressive symptoms in some samples; however, in this dataset the direct correlation between median sleep duration and CES‑D is negligible, while variability measures display only small positive correlations with CES‑D (≈ 0.2). Thus objective sleep patterns flag a potential risk domain (irregular and prolonged sleep) but are not, by themselves, strongly predictive of elevated CES‑D here.

Circadian/heart‑rate rhythm and physiological activity:
Heart rate cosinor and nonparametric circadian features indicate relatively low rhythm robustness. Interdaily stability (0.32, z ≈ -0.74), intradaily variability (0.38, z ≈ -1.16), autocorrelation at 24 h (0.17, z ≈ -1.29), and amplitude (8.27, z ≈ -0.81) are all below population averages, implying a blunted and less regular daily cardiovascular rhythm. MESOR and resting heart rate are near the population mean (MESOR ≈ 71.1 bpm, resting HR ≈ 59.1 bpm). Aggregate hourly deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime increases with an acrophase in the mid‑afternoon (≈ 4:37 PM). The circadian irregularities could reflect irregular schedules, variable sleep timing, or lifestyle factors (e.g., low exercise) rather than a primary mood signal; correlations between these rhythm metrics and CES‑D are small in this sample, so they are a secondary piece of evidence.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
The participant reports minimal exercise (exercised alone and with others: “Not at all”; exercise z-scores strongly negative), limited participation in organized sports, moderate alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), and no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use. Socializing time is moderate (1–2 hours daily). Low exercise and low health satisfaction coupled with irregular sleep may represent lifestyle vulnerabilities that can potentiate mood symptoms over time. However, the magnitude of correlations between these behavioral items and CES‑D in the study is small to modest, suggesting limited direct predictive weight compared with trait anxiety and self‑esteem.

Integrated interpretation and relative CES‑D risk:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most CES‑D‑predictive indicators in this dataset point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety and self‑esteem have the largest sample correlations with CES‑D and both favor lower scores for this participant (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem). Current happiness and perceived stress further align with lower depressive symptoms. Countervailing signals include very poor subjective sleep quality (high PSQI), prolonged and irregular objective sleep, low physical activity, and blunted circadian rhythm metrics; these indicate areas of functional difficulty and potential risk but in this sample have smaller direct associations with CES‑D than the trait measures. Overall, the pattern is mixed but weighted toward an overall CES‑D score that would fall in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not among the most elevated CES‑D scores). Limitations: no direct CES‑D raw score is available for this participant, and some objective signals (sleep irregularity, hypersomnia, circadian blunting) could presage increases in mood symptoms over time even if current trait markers are favorable.

28254,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Self-report profile: The participant’s trait and state self-reports indicate a generally adaptive psychosocial profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 32, z = -0.92) is below the sample mean, and self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40, z = 0.26); both of these measures have strong correlations with CES-D in the expected directions (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71), which together point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS score = 19, z = -0.71) and overall health satisfaction is somewhat above average (5/7, z = 0.55), further supporting relatively lower psychosocial distress. Subjective happiness is modestly reduced (happy = 3.0, z = -0.53), and alcohol use is somewhat higher than average (beer and wine 1–2×/week, z ≈ 0.9–1.0) but shows minimal correlation with CES-D in this sample. Taken together, the self-report profile provides stronger evidence for lower-than-average depressive symptoms than for elevated symptoms.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics: Heart-rate circadian metrics show reduced regularity and dampened amplitude relative to the study sample. Interdaily stability is low (0.28, z = -1.07) and amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (8.37 bpm, z = -0.78), despite a mesor near the sample mean (72.7 bpm, z = -0.17). Resting heart rate is modestly above average (61.9 bpm, z = 0.45). The aggregate hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks, with pronounced daytime elevations in early afternoon (peak deviations ~+12–13 bpm across 1–4 pm) and relatively low evening deviations (~0 to -7 bpm 6–11 pm). While circadian dampening and irregularity have been linked to mood disturbance in prior work, the correlations with CES-D in this dataset are small for most circadian metrics (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.10, interdaily stability r ≈ -0.01, resting HR r ≈ 0.19), indicating that these wearable signals provide only modest direct evidence of elevated depressive symptoms for this participant.

Sleep behavior and variability: Objective sleep duration is slightly below the study mean (median 6 h 45 min, z = -0.53) but sleep duration is relatively consistent (SD = 45 min, z = -1.26), indicating stable total sleep time across the recording period. Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 7, z = 0.13), suggesting perceived sleep problems despite reasonably regular sleep quantity. Sleep start time is around 00:50 on average with notable variability in bedtime timing (SD ≈ 122 minutes, z = 0.86), which may reflect inconsistent sleep timing even if total nightly duration is fairly stable. Sleep-related measures show small correlations with CES-D in this sample; thus, subjective sleep disturbance raises some concern but does not strongly point toward high depressive symptom burden given the rest of the profile.

Synthesis and CES-D placement: Integrating self-report, sleep, and wearable physiology yields a mixed but overall favorable signal with respect to depressive symptom burden. Strong protective indicators include low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, below-average perceived stress, and generally positive health satisfaction; these measures have the largest established associations with CES-D in the dataset and point toward lower depressive symptoms. Countervailing signals are limited: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), some circadian irregularity and reduced amplitude in heart-rate rhythms, and modestly elevated alcohol use—none of which show strong CES-D correlations in this sample. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (particularly the low anxiety and high self-esteem scores, which correlate strongly with CES-D) supports that this participant’s CES-D score would more likely fall in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

Current self-rated happiness is below the sample median (3.0, Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 22, Z ≈ 0.1). Interpersonal trust is low (Z = -2.07), which in this dataset is moderately associated with higher depressive symptoms (r ≈ -0.41). Subjective sleep quality is labeled as disturbed on the PSQI (score = 6), indicating some perceived sleep problems despite objective data described below.

Wearable sleep and circadian physiology: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 29 min, Z = +1.61) but substantial night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 146 min, Z = +1.04) and a very late median sleep start time (02:12 AM). The participant also recorded more frequent short naps than typical (mean daily naps 0.3, Z = +2.66). Circadian rhythm features from heart rate are broadly within or slightly above population norms: interdaily stability and intradaily variability are near average (Z ≈ +0.33 and +0.03), amplitude and mesor are modestly elevated (amplitude Z = +0.63; mesor Z = +0.43), and resting heart rate is typical (57.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.04). Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show elevated relative heart rate during late-night/early‑morning and a pronounced evening peak (largest positive deviation around 6–7 PM), consistent with preserved day–night structure rather than gross circadian disruption. Overall, objective circadian structure does not show strong markers of blunted or highly irregular rhythms; the main wearable-derived concern is sleep timing variability rather than loss of circadian amplitude or stability.

Behavioral and functional indicators: The participant reports minimal exercise and sports participation (frequencies near the low end of the sample distribution), high daily internet use (>4 hours, Z = +2.19), substantial time reading (reported >4 hours, very high Z = +6.21), and moderate-to-high social time with friends (3–4 hours, Z = +1.74). Academic performance is strong and stable (GPAs ≈ 3.74–3.77). Substance use is low. Taken together, these behaviors indicate preserved academic functioning and engagement in some social activities, but low physical activity and relatively high sedentary and solitary screen/reading time; low exercise is only weakly associated with CES-D in this sample.

Integrative interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: When weighted by the strongest available associations with CES-D in this dataset, the participant displays several protective indicators: notably low trait anxiety (strong positive correlate of depression) and high self‑esteem (strong negative correlate). These two measures carry large sample correlations with CES-D and point toward lower symptom burden. Mixed or modest risk indicators include disturbed subjective sleep, late and variable sleep timing, low interpersonal trust, reduced exercise, and somewhat lower momentary happiness; however, the wearable circadian metrics (amplitude, interdaily stability, resting heart rate) do not show the pattern typically associated with marked depressive symptom elevations in this cohort. Academic functioning is high, which is another functional sign more consistent with lower depressive burden. Overall, the balance of evidence—especially the high‑magnitude associations of low STAI and high self‑esteem with CES‑D—favors placement in the lower half of the CES‑D distribution in this study population.

Self‑esteem is lower than the cohort average (RSES = 32; Z = -0.87) and the self‑esteem–CES‑D correlation in the study is substantial and negative (r = -0.71), indicating that their lower self‑worth is a meaningful marker that typically accompanies higher CES‑D scores. Subjective happiness is below the sample mean (Current happy = 3.0; Z = -0.53) and its negative correlation with CES‑D (r = -0.46) again aligns with a profile tending toward elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s PSQI score (7.0) meets the usual threshold for disturbed sleep, which commonly co-occurs with elevated depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral and social context: Several lifestyle features are consistent with behavioral risk factors for higher depressive symptoms. The participant reports very low levels of socializing (16–30 minutes; Z = -1.41) and minimal engagement in sports or exercise (exercise frequencies with Z-scores between -1.18 and -0.88). Sedentary hobby time is notably high (2–3 hours; Z = 2.01). Substance use is minimal, which is protective in one domain, but low physical activity and relatively limited social interaction are behavioral patterns that, in this population, tend to co-occur with higher CES‑D scores (exercise and socializing correlations with CES‑D are modestly negative). Overall, the behavioral profile suggests reduced engagement in social and active behaviors that typically buffer against depressive symptoms.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-recorded sleep duration is, on average, ample (median night sleep ≈ 7 h 54 min; Z = 0.89) and night-to-night sleep duration variability is low-to-average, which are generally protective features. However, the participant exhibits a late median sleep start time (~01:59 AM) and a subjective PSQI indicating disturbed sleep, suggesting a mismatch between objective duration and subjective sleep quality. Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate are relatively strong: interdaily stability is high (0.58; Z = 1.41) and 24-hour autocorrelation is above average (Z = 0.81), while intradaily variability is below average (Z = -0.53). These measures indicate a reasonably structured and stable rest–activity/cardiac rhythm across days, which is usually associated with lower, not higher, depressive symptom burden.

Cardiovascular/physiological indicators: Resting heart rate (63.2 bpm; Z = 0.6) and cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude are modestly above the cohort mean (mesor Z = 0.83; amplitude Z = 0.81). Hourly aggregated deviations show expected nocturnal decreases in heart rate and daytime elevations; peaks in the evening hours (e.g., 9–10 pm with a high deviation and large positive Z) suggest elevated evening arousal relative to mesor. Several of these physiological measures have modest positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (e.g., resting heart rate r ≈ 0.19), but correlations are small-to-moderate and should be interpreted alongside self-report and behavior.

Integrated interpretation and likely CES‑D placement: The evidence is mixed but leans toward an elevated depressive symptom burden. Strong indicators pointing toward higher CES‑D include elevated trait anxiety, lower self‑esteem (a large negative correlate of CES‑D), elevated perceived stress, reduced reported happiness, low social engagement, and low physical activity. Countervailing evidence that would argue for low CES‑D—objective, adequate nightly sleep duration and relatively strong circadian regularity—is present but tempered by the participant’s disturbed subjective sleep quality and late sleep timing. Physiological markers show small associations with CES‑D and do not offset the self-report risk signals. Taking the full multimodal pattern together, the balance of evidence suggests that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of depressive symptom severity within the study population.

64572,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) and above-average self-regard (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 0.54). These two measures have strong, opposing correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI correlated positively with CES-D, r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem correlated negatively, r ≈ -0.71). Current affect measures are mixed: self-reported happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (current happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53), while perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 22, Z = 0.1). Interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are above-average relative to peers (trust Z ≈ 0.83; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45 indicates slightly below average health satisfaction, but the trust score is a notable social resource). Overall, trait-level indicators (low anxiety, higher self-esteem, higher trust) point toward lower depressive symptom burden, whereas modestly reduced momentary happiness and average stress provide some countervailing signal.

Sleep reports and interpretation: Subjective and wearable-derived sleep converge on a pattern of somewhat shortened, late-timed sleep with modestly elevated sleep disturbance. The PSQI score is 6 (classified as disturbed sleep) and the Fitbit-derived median sleep duration is 6 hours 38 minutes (Z = -0.69), suggesting shorter-than-average sleep. Median sleep onset is late (about 00:42) but sleep timing variability is not large (start-time SD Z = -0.61). Daytime napping is essentially absent. Poorer subjective sleep quality is a known contributor to depressive symptoms; here it represents a potential, but relatively modest, risk factor in the context of otherwise favorable trait indicators.

Wearable circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a well-entrained, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (value = 0.61, Z = 1.66), intradaily variability is near average (Z ≈ -0.11), and autocorrelation at 24 h is modestly positive (Z = 0.39), consistent with consistent day-to-day structure. Resting heart rate is relatively low (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93) and MESOR is lower than the sample mean (Z = -0.92), while amplitude is modestly above average (Z = 0.49) and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (≈4:57 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal troughs (large negative deviations overnight) and elevated cardiovascular deviation in the evening hours (notably 8–9 pm Z = 2.47 and 9–10 pm Z = 1.81). The overall pattern suggests physiologically stable circadian organization with some evening arousal. In this dataset, circadian regularity and lower resting heart rate do not show strong associations with higher CES-D; they more often index preserved physiological regulation rather than elevated depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral lifestyle context: The participant reports low substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use; negative Z-scores), regular engagement in sports (1–2×/week, Z = 0.91) and modest social contact (socializing 1–2 hours, Z ≈ 0.16). Recreational screen use and gaming are somewhat higher than average (video games Z ≈ 0.96), but overall daytime activities and exercise patterns reflect active engagement. Academic performance (GPA entries) is in the competent range. These lifestyle indicators—low substance use, regular physical activity, and social engagement—are generally protective with respect to depressive symptoms.

Holistic assessment relative to CES-D distribution: Weighing the multimodal evidence, several relatively strong indicators point toward lower depressive symptom burden: low trait anxiety (STAI), above-average self-esteem (strong inverse correlate of CES-D), high interdaily stability and low resting heart rate (physiological signs of intact regulation), low substance use, and routine physical and social activity. Countervailing signals include a borderline-elevated PSQI (score = 6), late and somewhat short sleep duration, and somewhat reduced momentary happiness; these constitute moderate risk factors but are smaller in magnitude or less consistently associated with CES-D in this participant’s profile. Given the balance of protective and risk features, the preponderance of evidence supports the participant having CES-D symptom levels in the lower half of the study population distribution.

28312,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates a mixed but concerning affective pattern. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48; Z = 0.66) and the STAI score has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), which signals that anxiety-proneness is a likely contributor to depressive symptom variance in this case. Self-esteem is modestly lower than the study mean (RSES = 35; Z = -0.45) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), further pointing toward risk for greater depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38) and subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 9; Z = 1.05), both of which are commonly associated with higher depression scores. At the same time the participant reports a current happiness rating above average (Z = 0.55), which is associated with lower CES-D (r ≈ -0.46) and represents a partial countervailing signal.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology present a mixed picture relative to self-report. Median nightly sleep duration is within a healthy range (7 h 35 m; Z = 0.51) and nap frequency is minimal, but the participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:23 AM) and subjective sleep quality is poor—this discrepancy (adequate duration but disturbed subjective sleep) can reflect sleep fragmentation, insomnia symptoms, or misaligned timing that contribute to mood complaints. Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics show relatively robust structure: elevated mesor (Z = 1.3), large amplitude (Z = 1.54), and high 24-h autocorrelation (Z = 0.9), with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:32 PM). Interdaily stability and intradaily variability are near the study mean. Overall, the wearable-derived rhythm metrics suggest intact and relatively strong circadian organization of cardiovascular activity rather than gross circadian disruption; this pattern may be a protective physiological marker despite subjective sleep disturbance.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators provide additional context that modestly favors a higher depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low frequency of structured exercise and sports (exercise alone or with others only 1–2 times per month; sports not at all), which is associated with elevated depressive symptoms in the literature and within this sample (small negative correlations with CES-D). Alcohol use at a 1–2 times per week cadence is slightly above average in the sample (Z ≈ 1.0), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Social time is present at moderate levels (1–2 hours/day) and sedentary hobbies are not endorsed. Academic performance is strong (GPAs near 3.8–4.0), which can be protective, but low self-esteem and elevated anxiety may nonetheless drive internalizing symptoms despite external achievement.

Weighing the multimodal evidence: there are several relatively strong risk signals for elevated depressive symptoms—particularly elevated trait anxiety (STAI), lower self-esteem (RSES), poor subjective sleep (PSQI), and modestly elevated perceived stress—each of which has known and, in this dataset, appreciable correlations with CES-D. Countervailing or protective indicators include objectively adequate sleep duration, robust heart-rate circadian structure, above-average self-reported happiness, and strong academic functioning. On balance, the constellation of elevated anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and disturbed subjective sleep—variables that show strong associations with CES-D in this study—tilts the overall profile toward greater depressive symptom burden relative to the sample median.

56805,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"Self-report trait and symptom indicators point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. The participant reports very low trait anxiety (STAI = 20, Z = -2.11) and high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66); both scales have strong correlations with CES-D in this dataset (STAI r = 0.81, RSES r = -0.71), such that the observed low anxiety and elevated self-esteem are robust protective signals. Self-reported current happiness is high (score = 5, Z = 1.64, CES-D r = -0.46) and perceived health satisfaction is at the top of the scale (7.0, Z = 2.05, CES-D r = -0.39), further consistent with lower depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS Z ≈ -0.17), so there is no strong self-reported elevation in stress that would offset the protective trait profile.

Objective and subjective sleep metrics show a mixed pattern but are more consistent with low-to-moderate risk. The Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is short relative to the study population (median 5 h 33 min, Z = -2.02), indicating objectively reduced sleep time; sleep-onset variability is moderate (median start ~01:20 AM, SD ~54 minutes, Z ≈ -0.63). In contrast, the self-reported PSQI indicates good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26), and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). The objective short sleep is a potential risk factor, but its correlation with CES-D in the provided metrics is very small, and subjective sleep quality and other protective psychosocial measures mitigate its weight in inference.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian metrics appear consistent with a physically fit individual and a generally organized diurnal profile. Resting heart rate is low (44.2 bpm, Z = -1.66) and the MESOR is below the sample mean (MESOR = 64.45, Z = -1.3), which, given modest positive CES-D correlations for RHR/MESOR here, aligns with lower depressive symptoms rather than higher. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm is near average and the acrophase (peak) around mid-afternoon (≈3:10 PM) is a typical timing for daytime physiological activity. Nonparametric circadian metrics show somewhat reduced interdaily stability (IS = 0.30, Z = -0.9) indicating less day-to-day regularity in heart-rate rhythms, while intradaily variability is near the mean (IV = 0.54, Z ≈ -0.04). These rhythm irregularities have small correlations with CES-D in this dataset, so they are secondary signals relative to trait and self-report measures.

Behavioral context supports the protective pattern. The participant reports frequent physical activity, including exercising with others and playing sports three times per week or more (exercise Z-scores positive), low-to-no substance use, limited sedentary recreation, and moderate social time; these behaviors correlate negatively or negligibly with CES-D in the sample and are consistent with lower depressive symptom risk. Academic performance (GPA ~3.3) and low reported daily recreational screen time further align with an overall functional profile.

Integration and inference regarding CES-D placement: Several of the strongest predictors in this dataset (trait anxiety, self-esteem, and subjective happiness) show values highly indicative of lower depressive symptoms, and those measures also have the largest correlations with CES-D in the sample. Objective short sleep is the most notable discordant indicator but has limited correlation with CES-D here and is counterbalanced by excellent subjective sleep quality and multiple protective psychosocial and behavioral signals (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high health satisfaction, frequent exercise, low substance use). Circadian irregularity and low interdaily stability provide a small risk signal but their associations with CES-D are weak in these data. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

26800,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Self-report profile and symptom-relevant questionnaires:
The participant’s survey profile presents a mixture of relatively protective and mild risk indicators with respect to depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI trait = 40) is close to the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.13) and is labeled “anxious” in the record, but is not markedly elevated; STAI scores are strongly positively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.81), which would increase risk when STAI is high, but here the observed STAI value is near average. Self‑esteem is relatively high versus the study sample (reported score with Z ≈ 0.96; note the raw score appears inconsistent with the stated scale, but the z-score indicates above‑average self‑esteem), and self‑esteem correlates strongly and negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71). Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range by PSQI (score = 5; Z ≈ -0.8). Current self‑reported happiness is modestly below average (current = 3.0; Z ≈ -0.53), and perceived stress is slightly below/near average (PSS = 21; Z ≈ -0.17). Taken together, the strong protective signal from above‑average self‑esteem and generally adequate subjective sleep quality outweighs the modest negative signals from reduced self‑reported happiness and average trait anxiety.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
Behavioral indices show limited regular exercise with infrequent solitary and group exercise (exercise frequency Z-scores −1.18 and −1.58) but participation in sports 1–2 times per week (Z ≈ 0.91). Socializing is moderate (1–2 hours; Z ≈ 0.16), substance use is occasional alcohol (beer and liquor 1–2x/week; Z ≈ 1.0 and 0.94) and no reported recreational or non‑prescribed drug use. Daily leisure activities are minimal for some common passive hobbies (e.g., “do not do” for TV, music, reading). Overall, lifestyle factors include some modest risk elements (low formal exercise frequency, alcohol use at a weekly level) but several protective/neutral features (regular sports participation, modest social contact, no drug use, healthy BMI, high academic performance).

Objective sleep and circadian physiology:
Wearable-derived sleep summaries indicate median nightly sleep of about 7 hours 14 minutes (Z ≈ 0.06), with modest night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 94 minutes) and very low nap frequency. These values are consistent with adequate sleep duration overall. However, sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:28 AM, SD ≈ 89 min), indicating a delayed or evening chronotype; delayed timing can be associated with mood symptoms in some contexts, but here total duration and subjective quality are adequate. PSQI and objective duration together suggest sleep quantity/quality are not prominent contributors to elevated CES‑D in this participant.

Cardiovascular circadian metrics and hourly heart rate pattern:
Heart rate–based circadian metrics show a lower overall mesor and resting heart rate (mesor ≈ 67.3, RHR ≈ 49.4; both Z ≲ -0.9 to -1.0), consistent with a low resting cardiovascular tone, which often reflects higher physical fitness. Amplitude is relatively small (≈ 8, Z ≈ -0.9), and interdaily stability is low (0.30, Z ≈ -0.9), indicating lower day‑to‑day regularity of the heart‑rate rhythm, while the autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately elevated (Z ≈ 0.64). Aggregated hourly deviations show the largest positive deviations from mesor in the mid‑to‑late morning (notably 9–11am values with large positive Zs), and expected nocturnal troughs in the early morning. The circadian profile—low resting HR and normal daytime activation—does not present a clear physiological signature of elevated depressive burden; low interdaily stability could be interpreted as mild irregularity in daily structure, but correlations between these circadian metrics and CES‑D in the dataset are small.

Synthesis and implications for depressive symptoms:
The strongest single indicator in this multimodal set is above‑average self‑esteem (z ≈ +0.96) which is highly inversely associated with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71); this provides a robust protective signal. Subjective and objective sleep quantity and quality are generally adequate, also consistent with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety, while conceptually linked to depression, is near the population average here and therefore does not strongly push toward elevated CES‑D. Behavioral markers (limited exercise frequency but some sports participation, modest social contact, no drug use) are mixed but do not present strong risk signals. Physiological covariates (low resting heart rate, normal daytime activation, modest circadian irregularity) likewise do not show a pattern strongly associated with high CES‑D in this dataset. Overall, protective indicators (notably high self‑esteem and adequate sleep) outweigh the modest risk indicators (late sleep timing, low formal exercise frequency, modestly reduced happiness).

Conclusion — likely CES‑D group:
Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically—especially the strong negative predictor of self‑esteem and the generally adequate sleep metrics and absence of marked physiological or behavioral risk signals—the participant’s profile is most consistent with a CES‑D score in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not among the more elevated depressive symptom burden group).

47142,19.0,0.7616580310880829,"Psychological trait and self-report indicators: The participant endorses a pattern of elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, classified as “anxious”) alongside somewhat reduced self-regard (Rosenberg self-esteem = 35; Z = -0.45) and lower momentary happiness (self-reported “Happy” Z = -0.53). Perceived stress is in the moderate range (PSS = 20, Z = -0.44) and overall health satisfaction is below the population mean (Z = -0.95). Taken together, these self-report measures show concordant signals: greater anxiety proneness and reduced positive self-appraisal/happiness are present and are strongly associated with depressive symptomatology in this dataset (notably STAI and self-esteem have strong correlations with CES-D in the study). At the same time, the participant reports little substance use and maintains above-average academic performance, which are contextual protective features.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns: The participant reports relatively low socializing (Z = -1.41) and limited group exercise, with most exercise occurring alone 1–2 times per week. Recreational screen activities are minimal. Sleep-related self-report (PSQI = 4; classified as “Good Sleep”, Z = -1.26) suggests subjectively adequate sleep quality; however objective sleep data indicate a median nightly duration of about 6 h 32 min (Z = -0.81) and a late median sleep onset (~01:39), plus a higher-than-average frequency of short daytime naps (mean daily naps = 0.3, Z = 2.66). These objective–subjective divergences (feeling that sleep is good despite short and late sleep timing and frequent napping) can be behaviorally relevant to mood regulation: late sleep timing and daytime napping are modestly associated with higher CES-D in the sample, while subjective sleep quality here appears protective.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian features: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a relatively robust and regular rhythm: higher interdaily stability (Z = 1.08), high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.48), and lower intradaily variability (Z = -1.31) — a pattern consistent with consistent daily structure and lower rhythm fragmentation. The cosinor MESOR and resting heart rate are elevated relative to the study sample (MESOR Z = 1.32; resting HR = 65.1 bpm, Z = 0.83), and the heart rate profile shows a clear nocturnal dip and an evening peak (acrophase ~5:06 PM). Elevated average heart rate and MESOR can reflect higher autonomic arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness and show small positive associations with CES-D in this dataset. In sum, the participant demonstrates physiologically consistent daily rhythms (which are generally protective) but a modestly elevated basal cardiovascular tone.

Integration and interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: There are mixed signals. Protective features include good self-reported sleep quality, robust circadian regularity, low substance use, and stable daily structure (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability). Features that point toward elevated depressive symptom burden include elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem and lower reported happiness, below-average health satisfaction, somewhat elevated resting MESOR/HR, late and relatively short nocturnal sleep with compensatory napping, and low social engagement. Several of these variables (trait anxiety and self-esteem in particular) have strong study-level correlations with CES-D, and the participant’s scores on those measures deviate in directions associated with higher depressive symptoms (even if not extreme). The wearable signals are not strongly supportive of severe affective disturbance — circadian regularity is relatively good — but physiological arousal (higher MESOR/HR) and sleep timing/napping patterns are additional, modest risk indicators.

Evidence for lower/median CES-D (bottom 50): The participant reports good subjective sleep quality, shows robust and regular circadian rhythm metrics, minimal substance use, and sustained academic performance; these factors are typically associated with lower or average depressive symptom levels. Objective rhythm metrics (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability) and an absence of severe sleep fragmentation argue against a high CES-D driven by circadian disruption.

Evidence for higher CES-D (top 50): Elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D in the sample), lower self-esteem (strong negative correlate), reduced momentary happiness, lower health satisfaction, elevated basal heart rate measures, late/short sleep with frequent napping, and reduced socializing provide a constellation of small-to-moderate risk signals that, in aggregate, point toward greater depressive symptom burden. Multiple measures that have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D deviate from the protective direction.

Holistic conclusion: Balancing protective circadian regularity and good subjective sleep against the psychologically salient markers (trait anxiety, reduced self-esteem and happiness, lower health satisfaction) and physiological indicators of elevated basal arousal, the preponderance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall CES-D score is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution than in the lower half.

60396,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Self-report indicators show a mixed but overall relatively resilient profile. Trait anxiety on the STAI is moderately elevated (score 42; Z ≈ 0.07) but close to the study mean; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81), even a modest elevation in anxiety is a relevant risk factor for depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is notably lower than average (Rosenberg score 33, Z ≈ -0.73) and this measure has a large negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), making low self-esteem one of the stronger risk signals in the survey data. At the same time, current self-reported happiness is above average (happy = 4, Z ≈ 0.55) and perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21, Z ≈ -0.17); interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are elevated (trust Z ≈ +1.15; health satisfaction Z ≈ +0.88). Taken together, the profile includes both notable risk (lower self-esteem, some anxiety) and protective subjective resources (relatively high happiness, trust, health satisfaction).

Objective sleep and circadian physiology from the wearable suggest generally regular, adequate sleep and well-structured circadian rhythms. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 23 min (Z ≈ +0.26) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD 70 min, Z ≈ -0.69). Sleep timing is late (median sleep onset ≈ 01:46), but onset timing is reasonably consistent (SD ≈ 53 min, Z ≈ -0.66). Cosinor and nonparametric rhythm metrics show preserved 24-hour structure: autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (Z ≈ +1.57), interdaily stability is near average, and intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -1.45), indicating low fragmentation of activity/rest cycles. Resting heart rate and MESOR are both lower than the sample mean (RHR ≈ 49.4 bpm, Z ≈ -1.04; MESOR Z ≈ -1.11), consistent with a lower baseline cardiac tone; amplitude is slightly below average. The hourly heart-rate deviations show expected deep nocturnal troughs and evening peaks (largest positive deviations in the 7–9 pm window), consistent with a consolidated daily activity pattern. Overall, these wearable-derived features are more characteristic of stable circadian organization than of the irregular sleep/activity patterns typically associated with higher depressive symptom burdens.

Behavioral routines and social activity provide additional protective signals. The participant reports frequent exercise with others (3+ times/week; Z ≈ +1.23), moderate solitary exercise, limited recreational drug use, and moderate alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2× weekly). Socializing time is modest but present, and recreational sedentary activities are not excessive. Many of these behaviors have small correlations with CES-D in the sample; the prominence of group exercise and high interpersonal trust in this participant’s profile are particularly relevant as potential buffers against depressive symptomatology.

Integration and likely CES-D placement: weighing the strongest survey predictors and the objective behavioral physiology, the profile is mixed but leans away from a high depressive symptom burden. The largest single risk indicator is lower self-esteem (a variable strongly associated with CES-D in this cohort), and trait anxiety is modestly elevated—both favor a higher CES-D. However, several protective factors are present and carry weight: above-average reported happiness, high interpersonal trust and health satisfaction, frequent social exercise, adequate and regular sleep duration, and well-structured circadian rhythms (high 24-h autocorrelation and low intradaily variability). Many wearable features that tend to co-occur with higher CES-D scores (irregular sleep timing, high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability) are absent here. On balance, the combination of objective stability in sleep/circadian measures and multiple psychosocial resources likely offsets the moderate risk signaled by low self-esteem and modest anxiety, making it more probable that this participant’s CES-D score falls at or below the study median rather than in the upper half.

They also endorse high health satisfaction and have no reported use of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Academic performance (multiple 4.0 GPAs) and regular physical activity (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more) further characterize a functioning profile that, in this sample, tends to be associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Objective sleep and wearable-derived circadian measures largely reinforce the pattern of behavioral regularity and sufficient restorative sleep. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 48 minutes (Z ≈ 0.76), with relatively low night-to-night variation (sleep-duration SD Z ≈ -0.87) and low variability in sleep start times (SD Z ≈ -0.74). The self-reported PSQI also classified sleep as good. These stable and adequate sleep metrics are typically protective against elevated depression scores and align with the weak correlations reported between sleep duration variability and CES-D in the dataset.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics indicate a robust, regular rest-activity physiological pattern with a few notable features. Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than the study mean (resting HR = 53 bpm, mesor Z ≈ -0.89), consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness. The cosinor-derived amplitude is somewhat elevated (amplitude Z ≈ 0.74) and the acrophase occurs in the early evening (~6:03 PM), with a pronounced aggregated hourly deviation in the 5–6 PM hour (deviation +39 bpm, Z ≈ 4.19). That evening peak is an outlier relative to the population and is plausibly explained by time-of-day bouts of physical activity (and is consistent with reported regular exercise); these HR features do not, in this dataset, show strong associations with CES-D. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z ≈ 0.81), indicating somewhat greater within-day fragmentation of heart-rate-derived activity, but its correlation with CES-D is near zero in the provided correlations.

Weighing protective and risk-relevant indicators together yields a coherent pattern: multiple robust protective signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, low perceived stress, high happiness, regular exercise, good and regular sleep, no substance use, low resting HR and consistent daily routine) outweigh the few minor risk signals (slightly elevated intradaily variability, relatively limited socializing time by comparison). Many of the strongest survey measures that correlate with CES-D (notably self-esteem and trait anxiety) point toward lower depressive symptom burden for this participant. Therefore, integrating the multimodal evidence, it is most likely that this participant’s CES-D score falls in the lower half of the study distribution.

92038,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"Summary of self-report psychological profile: The participant’s self-report pattern is characterized by several indicators that typically align with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI-T = 31, Z = -1.02) is well below the sample mean, self-reported happiness is relatively high (current = 5.0, Z = 1.64), and the self-esteem score is elevated relative to the study sample (RSES Z = 1.66), all of which correlate strongly with lower CES-D scores in this cohort (STAI–CESD r ≈ 0.81 positive; Self‑esteem–CESD r ≈ -0.71 negative). Perceived stress is near or slightly below average for the sample (PSS score 20, Z ≈ -0.44), and health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 1.3). Academically and socially the participant reports adaptive functioning (high GPAs, regular exercise both solo and with others, ~1–2 hours socializing), and little recreational drug use; these behavioral features are consistent with lower depressive symptomatology in student samples.

Sleep and circadian/wearable summary: Objective sleep quantity from the Fitbit is adequate on average (median nightly duration ≈ 7 h 36 min, Z = 0.52), and the participant reports no regular naps. However, subjective sleep quality is just over the commonly used PSQI cutoff (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep), and sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep onset ≈ 01:27 AM with substantial night-to-night variability, SD ≈ 114 minutes, Z = 0.69; sleep duration SD ≈ 145 minutes, Z = 1.0). These timing and variability features have small positive associations with CES-D in the dataset (sleep timing/variability r ≈ 0.2), implying some modest risk contribution. From heart-rate circadian metrics, the participant shows a clear day–night amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ 0.99) with a late-afternoon acrophase (~5:12 PM) and a relatively low resting heart rate (≈53 bpm, Z = -0.56), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Non-parametric rhythm features show mildly reduced interdaily stability (0.39, Z ≈ -0.16) and elevated intradaily variability (0.72, Z ≈ 1.23), suggesting some fragmentation of physiological rhythms across the day; in this sample intradaily variability has only weak correlations with CES-D (r ≈ -0.05).

Integration of multimodal signals relative to depressive symptoms: The strongest and most diagnostic signals for CES-D in this dataset are the psychosocial/self-report indicators (trait anxiety, self‑esteem, momentary happiness), all of which point toward a relatively low depressive symptom burden for this participant. Objective wearable signals present a mixed picture: average sleep duration and robust day–night heart-rate amplitude are protective features, whereas late, inconsistent sleep timing and elevated intradaily variability represent modest risk factors that are weakly associated with higher CES‑D in the sample. Physiological arousal patterns (low resting HR, clear daytime HR increases in the afternoon/evening) and active lifestyle variables (regular exercise, low recreational drug use, social contact) further reduce the likelihood of substantially elevated depressive symptoms. The magnitude and direction of the strongest correlates (notably low STAI and high self-esteem, which have substantial sample-level correlations with CES‑D) carry greater weight than the weaker associations observed for sleep timing variability and intradaily variability.

Overall CES-D ranking judgment: Balancing the strong protective self-report indicators and generally adaptive behavioral and physiological patterns against the isolated risk signals (PSQI >5, late/variable sleep timing, some circadian fragmentation), the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the CES‑D distribution in this study population.

86440,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Self-report profiles indicate a generally adaptive psychological presentation with few markers of elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 38) is below the study mean (Z = -0.33) and is classified here as “not anxious,” and self-esteem is high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17), both characteristics that typically associate with lower CES‑D scores (note strong negative correlation of self‑esteem with CES‑D: r = -0.71). Current positive affect (self-rated “Happy” = 4.0, Z = 0.55) and moderate interpersonal trust (Z = 0.5) further align with a lower risk profile: these measures correlate negatively with CES‑D in the sample (happy r = -0.46; trust r = -0.41). Perceived stress is lower than average (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71), which argues against a high symptom burden despite the well‑established positive correlation between stress and depressive symptoms.

Objective and subjective sleep metrics present a mixed picture but do not strongly support high depressive symptom burden. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration (~7 h 1 min, Z = -0.21) and low nap frequency (0.0, Z = -0.86) indicate adequate total sleep time by objective Fitbit measures; sleep timing is somewhat late (median sleep onset ≈ 00:50) but relatively consistent (sleep start SD 51 min, Z = -0.7). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7) crosses the common threshold for “disturbed sleep,” suggesting some perceived sleep problems not fully captured by duration. Overall, the discrepancy of modest subjective sleep disturbance in the context of generally normative objective sleep does not, in isolation, suggest a high CES‑D score—especially given that most sleep and circadian correlates with CES‑D in this dataset are small.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics reflect a solidly entrained and physiologically calm profile. Resting heart rate is low (51 bpm, Z = -0.85) and MESOR is reduced relative to the sample (64.7, Z = -1.27), consistent with lower tonic cardiovascular arousal or higher fitness; daytime hour-by-hour aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations between ~1–7 AM) and a daytime peak in mid-afternoon (largest positive deviation at 2–3 PM, Z = 1.22). Circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability ~0.39, intradaily variability ~0.56) are near-sample-average and autocorrelation at 24 hours is somewhat elevated (Z = 0.48), indicating a typical daily rhythm without marked fragmentation. The limited magnitude and direction of correlations between these circadian/HR measures and CES‑D in the sample are small, and the participant’s objective rhythms do not show patterns commonly associated with higher depressive symptom burden (e.g., flattened amplitude combined with high rhythm fragmentation).

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators mostly align with lower depressive symptomatology. The participant reports minimal substance use, engages in sports at a frequency above the sample average (sports 1–2×/week, Z = 0.91), and spends moderate amounts of time socializing (1–2 hours/day). Recreational screen time and sedentary hobby engagement are modest. Academic performance (GPA) is high. These positive lifestyle and role-function indicators typically index lower depressive symptoms in student samples. There are no prominent behavioral red flags such as social withdrawal, high substance use, or highly erratic sleep timing that would push the overall estimate toward elevated CES‑D status.

Holistic integration: multiple converging signals predict a CES‑D score that is not in the upper half of the study distribution. Strong protective indicators include above‑average self‑esteem and positive affect, low trait anxiety and perceived stress, active engagement in sports, limited substance use, and physiologic markers consistent with low tonic arousal and preserved circadian structure. The main cautionary signal is a mildly elevated PSQI suggesting subjective sleep disturbance, but this is contradicted by normative objective sleep duration and rhythm regularity. Given the sample distributions (population median CES‑D = 11; mean = 13.31) and the pattern of self-report and wearable measures—many of which negatively correlate with CES‑D in the cohort—the preponderance of evidence supports placing this participant’s depressive symptom burden in the lower half of the sample distribution.

29792,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"Self-report measures portray a mixed but overall resilient profile. The participant reports modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; z = 0.17) but also maximal self‑esteem (RSES = 40; z = 0.26) and relatively high momentary happiness (Current happy = 4.0; z = 0.55). Perceived stress is near the sample average (PSS = 21; z = -0.17) and health satisfaction is slightly above average (z = 0.22). The PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score = 7), which signals subjective sleep difficulties despite otherwise positive self-evaluations. Correlational information in the sample shows strong positive association between anxiety and CES‑D and strong negative association between self‑esteem and CES‑D; in this case the participant’s moderate anxiety could push risk upward but the very high self‑esteem and above-average happiness provide substantive protective signal against elevated depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and social habits emphasize frequent social and physical engagement. The participant exercises with others three or more times per week (z = 1.23) and reports 1–2 hours of socializing with friends daily (z = 0.16); both behaviors are associated in the sample with lower CES‑D scores. Alcohol use is relatively frequent for beer (three times a week or more; z = 1.72) but correlations between alcohol use and CES‑D in this dataset are minimal. Leisure patterns include moderate TV/video and video game time (both elevated relative to the sample), but these activities show weak associations with CES‑D here. Overall, the activity profile — regular group exercise, social time, and healthy BMI (20.0) — favors lower depressive symptomatology in the context of the study correlations.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep reveal a distinct late‑night pattern with generally preserved circadian amplitude but some irregularity. Median sleep onset is very late (about 04:31 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 11 m; z = -1.25), and the PSQI corroborates subjective sleep disturbance. Circadian summary metrics show modest interdaily stability (0.46; z = 0.42) and low autocorrelation at 24 h (0.19; z = -1.12), suggesting some day‑to‑day inconsistency in overall patterning. Heart‑rate features indicate a relatively low resting heart rate (52 bpm; z = -0.73), a mesor slightly below population average (69.94; z = -0.55), and elevated heart‑rate deviations in late evening hours (e.g., 7–8 pm and 12–1 am show high positive deviations, z > 1), with marked negative deviations across the morning hours. This pattern is consistent with an evening‑active schedule and greater physiological arousal in the late evening, which plausibly contributes to the late sleep timing and subjective sleep disturbance. In this sample, short/late sleep and sleep disturbance are risk correlates for CES‑D, but the participant’s circadian amplitude and overall activity do not show strong risk signal beyond sleep timing.

Integrated assessment and likelihood relative to the study distribution: risk and protective indicators are both present. Risk factors that align with higher CES‑D in the sample include elevated trait anxiety, disturbed sleep (PSQI > 5), and a pronounced late sleep schedule. Protective, and in several cases strongly protective, factors include maximal self‑esteem, above‑average happiness, regular social and group exercise, high interpersonal trust, healthy BMI, and low resting heart rate (fitness indicator). Given the relatively strong protective signals (notably the very high self‑esteem and social/exercise engagement) and only moderate risk signals (borderline anxiety and sleep timing issues), the overall balance of evidence suggests this participant’s depressive symptom burden is more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

14737,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report trait and symptom measures indicate a mixed but concerning profile with respect to depressive symptom risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) is elevated relative to the sample mean and this measure shows a very strong positive association with CES-D in the study (r = 0.81), so this single feature provides substantial evidence consistent with greater depressive symptom burden. Rosenberg self-esteem (score = 34, Z = -0.59) is below the sample mean and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), which likewise points toward higher depressive symptoms when considered with the STAI result. Other self-report indices are mixed: current happiness is slightly above average (Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is below average (Z = -0.44), both of which would argue for lower depressive symptomatology (happiness correlates moderately negatively with CES-D, r ≈ -0.46). Interpersonal trust is relatively low (Z = -0.78; r ≈ -0.41 with CES-D), which again aligns with higher CES-D in the population-level associations. In sum, trait anxiety and low self-esteem are the strongest self-report indicators in this record and they point toward higher depressive symptom burden, while elevated self-rated happiness and lower perceived stress provide countervailing but weaker evidence.

Sleep patterns and subjective sleep quality show features often linked to affective disturbance. The participant’s PSQI score (6) crosses the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep and their objective median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is short (6 h 3 min; Z = -1.41). Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is elevated (sleep start SD Z = 1.14; sleep duration SD Z = 0.74), and these variability metrics have modest positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.22; duration SD r ≈ 0.20). These data suggest fragmented or irregular sleep timing and shorter-than-average sleep opportunity across the semester—patterns that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptoms at the group level. Subjective and objective sleep measures therefore provide additional, moderate evidence toward increased symptom burden.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show largely intact daily structure but some atypical phasic features. Non-parametric stability (interdaily stability Z = 0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 h (Z = 0.22) are slightly above average, indicating reasonably consistent day-to-day structure in heart rate rhythms; intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z = 0.67), but its correlation with CES-D is negligible in this sample. Mesor and amplitude of the cosinor model are near-average (mesor Z = 0.05; amplitude Z = 0.53), and resting heart rate is below average (54.2 bpm; Z = -0.47). Lower resting heart rate here aligns weakly with lower CES-D in the population correlation (r ≈ 0.19 for resting HR → CES-D positive, so lower RHR points away from higher CES-D). Hourly aggregate deviations show an unusually large evening heart-rate elevation (notably 6–7 pm, Z = 1.65), but correlations of these hourly deviations with CES-D are small and inconsistent. Overall, the circadian and heart-rate data do not provide strong, unambiguous evidence of elevated depressive symptomatology; they suggest maintained daily structure with some increased intraday variability and an elevated evening heart-rate deviation that is of uncertain relevance to CES-D in this sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators from surveys suggest lower social and physical engagement with some sedentary tendencies. The participant reports minimal socializing and almost no group exercise (socializing Z = -1.41; exercising with others Z = -1.58), low participation in sports, and a high value for time spent in sedentary hobbies (Z = 1.41). Substance use is essentially nil. Correlations between social/exercise variables and CES-D in this dataset are small, but low social engagement and low group activity are conceptually and empirically linked to greater depressive symptoms in many contexts. Academic performance is good (GPAs mostly high), which may reflect functional resilience in the academic domain despite other risk indicators.

Synthesis and CES-D placement: weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most predictive indicators in this profile point toward higher depressive symptom burden. In particular, elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and below-average self-esteem are both strongly correlated with CES-D in the study and are present here; disturbed subjective sleep plus objective short and irregular sleep add moderate, corroborating evidence. Low interpersonal trust and reduced social engagement further support the same direction. Countervailing signals include above-average current happiness, lower perceived stress, low resting heart rate, and generally preserved circadian stability; these features argue toward lower or average CES-D but are either weaker correlates or inconsistent with the strongest predictors. Considering the relative magnitudes of correlations and Z-scores across measures, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the upper half of the sample distribution.

28653,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Multimodal psychological and behavioral synthesis:
The self-report data indicate a profile characterized by low trait anxiety and relatively strong positive affect and psychosocial resources. The participant’s STAI–Trait score (29) is substantially below the sample mean (z = -1.22), indicating low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem is elevated (RSES z = 1.52) and self-rated happiness is high (z = 1.64); both of these scales have moderate-to-strong negative correlations with CES-D in the dataset (self-esteem r = -0.71, happiness r = -0.46), which suggests these self-report indicators are protective against depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is near the sample average (PSS z ≈ -0.17), and health satisfaction is high (z = 1.63). Substance use is minimal and social activity via exercising with others is above average (exercising with others z = 1.23), which together point to adaptive lifestyle and social engagement patterns that typically associate with lower depressive symptoms.

Sleep, daily routine, and wearable-derived circadian physiology:
Both subjective and objective sleep indices are consistent with adequate, regular sleep. The PSQI score classifies as “good sleep” (PSQI = 4, z = -1.26), and Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep is relatively long (median 8 h 4 min; z = 1.10) with low mean daily naps. Sleep start time variability is modest (SD ≈ 107 minutes, z = 0.53) but overall sleep duration variability is near average (SD z ≈ -0.03). Heart-rate–based circadian features show a highly regular, high-amplitude rhythm: interdaily stability is elevated (0.58; z = 1.41), intradaily variability is very low (0.25; z = -2.08), amplitude is large (17.77; z = 2.26), and autocorrelation at 24 h is above average (z = 1.40). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm; z = -0.61). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected large nocturnal dip and a pronounced afternoon peak (notably 3–4 pm deviation z = 3.82), indicating consolidated sleep–wake timing and a strong daytime activity/physiological arousal rhythm. Overall, these wearable markers are characteristic of a stable, well-entrained circadian system and low physiological fragmentation—patterns generally associated with better mood regulation.

Convergence of multimodal indicators relevant to depressive symptoms:
Across domains there is consistent evidence pointing away from elevated depressive symptomatology. Strong protective signals include low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep quality paired with objectively long and regular sleep, low substance use, active social exercise, high trust, and robust circadian rhythmicity. Many of these measures have negative correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., self-esteem r = -0.71, happiness r = -0.46, trust r = -0.41) such that higher scores on those predictors tend to align with lower depressive symptoms. Wearable circadian indices (high amplitude and stability, low intradaily variability) also comport with a lower-risk physiological profile, and resting heart rate is modestly lower than average, which often correlates with better cardiovascular and stress resilience.

Evaluation of evidence for low vs. elevated CES-D and final group assignment:
Evidence consistent with a lower CES-D (bottom half of the sample) — low trait anxiety (STAI z = -1.22), elevated self-esteem (z = 1.52) and happiness (z = 1.64), good PSQI (z = -1.26), minimal substance use, frequent social exercise, and strong, stable circadian rhythms (interdaily stability z = 1.41; intradaily variability z = -2.08; amplitude z = 2.26) — collectively supports an overall low depressive symptom burden. Evidence favoring a higher CES-D score is minimal in this profile: perceived stress is near average, but not markedly elevated, and correlations between some wearable measures and CES-D are small or near zero. No direct CES-D score is provided for the participant; however, the convergence of multiple protective psychosocial and physiological indicators makes it more likely that this individual’s CES-D score would fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

95559,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 29, z = -1.22) and relatively high self-esteem (RSES z ≈ 0.96), both of which are robustly associated with lower depressive symptom burden in this sample (population correlations with CES‑D: STAI ≈ +0.81, self‑esteem ≈ -0.71). Perceived stress is modest (PSS = 20, z = -0.44) and momentary happiness is slightly below the sample mean (current happiness z = -0.53). The PSQI score (7) indicates subjectively disturbed sleep over the past month, but its z-score is near the sample average (z = 0.13). Overall, trait-level affective indicators (particularly low anxiety and elevated self‑esteem) point toward a lower likelihood of elevated CES‑D scores.

Behavioral and lifestyle markers: Alcohol consumption is relatively frequent (beer three times per week or more, beer z = +1.72; wine 1–2×/week, z = +0.94), while recreational and non‑prescribed drug use are absent. Physical activity is modest (exercise alone and with others both ~1–2×/week) and social time is near the sample mean. Leisure patterns show above‑average time listening to music (z = +1.13) and limited engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies. Higher alcohol intake can be a risk factor for mood symptoms, but in this dataset alcohol usage has little association with CES‑D (population correlations near zero); by contrast, the participant’s active protective profile of low anxiety and higher self‑esteem appears more diagnostically relevant.

Sleep timing, quantity, and napping: Objective sleep data show a late and irregular sleep schedule (median sleep start ≈ 02:10 AM) and somewhat short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 39 min, z = -0.66). Night‑to‑night sleep variability is moderate, and the participant takes more daytime naps than typical in this sample (mean daily naps z = +2.07). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI > 5) corroborates some sleep disturbance. Late chronotype, shorter nighttime sleep, and elevated napping can be associated with mood symptoms and impaired daytime functioning; however, in this dataset sleep‑duration and many sleep metrics show weak direct correlations with CES‑D, so these are contributory but not definitive signals.

Wearable circadian and heart‑rate features: Circadian summary metrics derived from heart rate indicate reduced rhythm regularity and amplitude relative to the study population: interdaily stability z ≈ -1.98 (low regularity), intradaily variability z ≈ -1.80, and amplitude z ≈ -1.16. The mesor and resting heart rate are slightly below average (resting HR ≈ 54 bpm, z ≈ -0.48). Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and an evening acrophase (~6:09 PM) with elevated deviations through the early evening hours. Reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability suggest a blunted or less stable physiological daily rhythm, which, in prior work, can co‑occur with affective dysregulation. In this study many circadian metrics have only small correlations with CES‑D, but the marked low interdaily stability stands out as a physiologic marker of irregular daily timing.

Integration and CES‑D group inference: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most CES‑D‑relevant indicators are the participant’s low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem—both strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms in the study population. Several risk signals are present (subjective sleep disturbance, late and irregular sleep timing, frequent naps, elevated alcohol use, and reduced circadian regularity/amplitude), but these features show weaker population correlations with CES‑D in these data and are more mixed in magnitude. On balance, the dominant, highly correlated protective markers (low STAI, high self‑esteem, modest perceived stress) outweigh the secondary risk indicators. Therefore, the overall pattern is more consistent with a CES‑D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

30152,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Summary of self-report psychological traits and symptom-related measures:
The participant reports moderately elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) and a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7, Z = 0.13). Trait anxiety on the STAI is near the study mean (STAI = 41, Z ≈ −0.03) rather than markedly elevated. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 36, Z = −0.31), and global health satisfaction is notably elevated (6/7, Z = 1.3). Self-reported current happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = −0.53). Of the survey-derived measures, self-esteem shows the strongest negative association with CES-D in the cohort (correlation ≈ −0.71), indicating that higher self-esteem in this participant is a robust predictor of lower depressive symptom burden relative to other features.

Sleep timing, sleep variability, and subjective sleep quality:
Wearable and self-report sleep metrics indicate irregular and late nocturnal timing with modestly shortened median sleep duration. Median sleep start time is late (02:28), and median sleep duration is under seven hours (6 h 48 m, Z = −0.48). Night-to-night variability is elevated (sleep duration SD ≈ 118 min, Z = 0.39; sleep start SD ≈ 102 min, Z = 0.41), and the PSQI >5 indicates subjective sleep disturbance. These timing irregularities and variability have small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (sleep variability and sleep timing SD correlations ≈ 0.2–0.22), suggesting that the participant’s late, variable sleep schedule is a relevant behavioral contributor to depressive symptom risk even though absolute sleep duration is only mildly reduced.

Circadian-patterned physiology and aggregated heart-rate features:
Heart-rate–based circadian summaries show a low mesor (62.7 bpm, Z = −1.54) and a relatively low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z = −1.04), which together are consistent with a relatively fit cardiovascular profile and lower tonic cardiac activation. The cosinor-derived amplitude and nonparametric measures of rhythm fragmentation are near sample averages (amplitude Z ≈ −0.06; intradaily variability Z ≈ −0.04), but autocorrelation at 24 hours is unusually low (0.15, Z = −1.45), indicating weaker day-to-day stability of heart-rate rhythms across the recording period. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show pronounced daytime increases in the late afternoon/early evening (notably 3–6 pm) and reduced nocturnal heart rate as expected; these hourly deviations have generally small correlations with CES-D. In sum, physiological data indicate good baseline cardiovascular fitness but reduced circadian regularity across days, a pattern that modestly aligns with elevated depressive symptoms in the cohort-level correlations.

Behavioral activities, social context, and substance use:
The participant reports frequent individual exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07) but no exercise with others or organized sports (Zs −1.58, −1.09), indicating solitary exercise habits. Recreational substance use is minimal (no beer, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs; modest wine/liquor use ~1–2 times/week). Time use shows modest internet use (2–3 hours/day, Z = 0.85) and 1–2 hours/day socializing with friends (Z = 0.16). The pattern of regular solo exercise, low substance use, and moderate social time is generally associated with lower depressive symptom risk in this cohort, though solitary exercise and lower indicators of interpersonal trust (trust Z = −0.46) could reflect relative social disengagement, which correl moderately with CES-D in the sample (trust correlation ≈ −0.41).

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
The data present a mixed but overall leaning-toward-lower symptom profile. Strong protective signals include relatively high self-esteem (large negative cohort correlation with CES-D), elevated health satisfaction, regular exercise frequency, low resting heart rate, and minimal substance misuse. Risk signals include elevated perceived stress, disturbed and irregular sleep timing, late median sleep onset, modestly lower current happiness, and reduced day-to-day circadian stability. Many of the wearable-derived associations with CES-D are small in magnitude; by contrast, self-esteem (−0.71) and health satisfaction (≈ −0.39) are among the largest cohort-level correlates favoring lower CES-D. Considering the relative effect sizes and the participant’s measured values, the balance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms rather than the upper half.

59592,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report data indicate the participant endorses a pattern of elevated anxiety proneness (STAI = 46; z ≈ +0.46) alongside modestly reduced self-worth (RSES = 35; z ≈ −0.45) and lower momentary happiness (current happy = 3.0; z ≈ −0.53). Perceived stress is slightly above the sample mean (PSS = 23; z ≈ +0.38). These survey variables carry moderate-to-strong sample correlations with CES-D in this dataset (STAI r ≈ +0.81; Self‑Esteem r ≈ −0.71; Happiness r ≈ −0.46), which suggests that this profile of higher anxiety, lower self‑esteem, and reduced positive affect is the set of self-report traits most strongly linked with greater depressive symptom burden in the study and that the participant’s scores on those measures align with risk-related patterns.

Objective wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics reveal features commonly associated with reduced circadian robustness and increased physiological arousal. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.30; z ≈ −0.9) while intradaily variability is relatively high (0.78; z ≈ +1.65), indicating day-to-day irregularity and greater fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm across 24‑hour cycles. Amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (6.93; z ≈ −1.25), and resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (66.1 bpm; z ≈ +0.95). The hourly aggregate deviations show a clear nocturnal decline in heart rate (largest negative deviations ~ −11 to −12 bpm in early morning hours) but an overall attenuated day–night amplitude compared with the population, consistent with the low amplitude statistic. In this cohort, circadian instability metrics and higher resting heart rate are modestly associated with greater depressive symptoms; thus, the wearable-derived profile points toward physiological patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated symptomatology.

Sleep and behavioral routine present a mixed picture. Median nightly sleep duration is near 7 hours (6 h 57 m; z ≈ −0.29), and subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; z ≈ −0.8) is at or slightly better than the sample average, which are features that would ordinarily be protective. However, sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:49) though relatively consistent night-to-night (start time SD = 39 min; z ≈ −0.97), and daytime napping is rare. Lifestyle indicators include low frequency of organized sport and infrequent exercise with others, greater time spent watching TV and on the internet, and modest socializing (social time 1–2 hours). Alcohol use of wine/liquor is somewhat above mean (1–2 times/week; z ≈ +0.94) but other substance use is minimal. The combination of late but stable sleep timing, limited social/group physical activity, and sedentary recreational habits suggests behavioral patterns that may limit mood‑enhancing exposures (e.g., daytime social/exercise engagement) despite preserved sleep quantity and subjective quality.

Weighing the modalities together: strong survey-level indicators tied to depression risk (notably elevated trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem, both highly correlated with CES‑D in this sample), plus objective physiological signals of circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability and amplitude) and elevated resting heart rate, provide convergent evidence of higher depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. Countervailing evidence for a lower CES‑D score includes near‑adequate sleep duration and borderline-good PSQI as well as low recreational drug use and consistent sleep timing; these are protective signals but are less strongly linked to CES‑D in the provided correlations than the anxiety/self‑esteem measures and circadian/physiological markers. On balance — given the participant’s profile of elevated anxiety, reduced self‑esteem and happiness, increased perceived stress, circadian disruption, and elevated resting heart rate — the preponderance of evidence points toward depressive symptom severity in the upper half of the study sample distribution.

The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) and comparatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.82) and current happiness (Z = 1.64). Interpersonal trust is markedly high (Z = 2.75). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). Academic performance (GPAs consistently high) and very low substance and recreational drug use further align with lower risk markers. Several of these self-report measures have relatively strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., STAI r = 0.81; SelfEsteem r = -0.71; Happy r = -0.46; Trust r = -0.41), and the participant’s scores on those measures lean in the direction associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Objective sleep and circadian metrics present a mixed pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is moderately short relative to the sample (6 hr 34 min, Z = -0.76) and median sleep onset is very late (≈02:54), but subjective sleep quality is good. Night-to-night sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 172 min, Z = 1.62), and sleep onset timing is somewhat variable (SD Z = 0.51). Elevated variability in sleep timing and duration is modestly associated with higher CES-D in the sample (sleep SD r ≈ 0.21), so these irregular sleep patterns represent a potential risk factor that contrasts with the participant’s good self-reported sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics indicate a generally present but somewhat fragmented daily rhythm. Non-parametric intradaily variability is elevated (IV Z = 1.3), while interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are near-average to low (IS Z = 0.17; autocorr24 Z = -0.87), suggesting more within-day fragmentation and weaker day-to-day regularity. Parametric circadian features (MESOR ≈ 73 bpm, amplitude ≈ 10.6 bpm, acrophase ~4:37 PM) are within typical ranges for the sample. Resting heart rate (~60 bpm) is near sample mean. Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations overnight) and a pronounced daytime/afternoon rise (peak positive deviations mid-afternoon, especially 3–4 PM), indicating typical daytime arousal rather than blunted diurnal tone. Overall, these patterns suggest circadian structure is present but with greater intraday fragmentation, a pattern that can be associated with stress and sleep irregularity rather than with clear markers of elevated depressive symptomatology in this participant.

Behavioral routines and lifestyle factors are mostly adaptive. The participant reports low sedentary recreational time, infrequent solitary exercise but moderate sports participation (1–2×/week), limited screen-time hobbies, and minimal substance use. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS Z = 1.74), which is noteworthy because stress shows a positive association with CES-D (r ≈ 0.29) and could contribute to symptom burden. However, high social trust, reported happiness, strong self-esteem, and good subjective sleep quality mitigate that risk. Academic functioning (high GPA) also supports a lower likelihood of marked functional impact from depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and CES-D group assignment: balancing indicators that correlate strongly with depressive symptoms in this cohort, the participant shows more protective than risk features. Low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, very high interpersonal trust, good subjective sleep quality, strong academic performance, and minimal substance use are all informative markers favoring lower CES-D scores. Countervailing evidence includes elevated perceived stress, late and variable sleep timing, and greater intradaily fragmentation in wearable rhythms; these likely raise some risk but are of smaller magnitude relative to the strengths. On balance, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s depressive symptom burden is more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution.

28724,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Paragraph 1 — Summary of self-report indicators relevant to depressive symptoms:
The participant’s self-report profile contains multiple indicators that, taken together, point toward relatively low to average depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg score 39, Z = 0.11) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = −0.71), which is a robust protective indicator. Current self‑rated happiness is elevated (5.0, Z = 1.64; sample correlation with CES‑D r = −0.46), and academic performance is strong (term GPAs 3.53 and 3.93). Perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 20, Z = −0.44) and only modestly positively correlated with CES‑D (r = 0.28). Although the trait anxiety score is in the mid-range (STAI = 40, Z = −0.13), STAI has a high positive correlation with CES‑D in the population (r = 0.81); in this case, the participant’s average STAI score does not suggest elevated depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep quality is just above a common cutoff for disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is a potential risk marker but only mildly divergent relative to peers (Z = −0.33).

Paragraph 2 — Behavioral and lifestyle factors that buffer or raise risk:
Behavioral habit data largely align with adaptive patterns. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), low substance use (no beer, no recreational or non‑prescribed drugs), and modest social engagement (1–2 hours socializing; Z = 0.16). Health satisfaction is average to slightly below average (4/7, Z = −0.20) and thus not a strong risk signal. Daily recreational habits do not show excessive solitary or passive behaviors; screen and music use are in modest ranges. Overall, lifestyle factors appear more protective than risk-inducing for depressive symptomatology.

Paragraph 3 — Objective sleep and circadian/heart rate features from the wearable:
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate generally adequate and regular sleep quantity. Median nightly sleep duration was approximately 7 hours 49 minutes (Z = 0.79), with low night-to-night variability in both duration (SD 65 minutes, Z = −0.81) and sleep start time (median start ~23:59, SD 28 minutes, Z = −1.22). Mean daily nap frequency is negligible. These objective sleep features are consistent with a pattern that typically reduces risk for depressive symptoms. Circadian heart rate metrics show some mixed signals: interdaily stability is relatively low (0.32, Z = −0.74) and intradaily variability is relatively high (0.76, Z = 1.51), suggesting less day‑to‑day regularity and more within‑day fragmentation of heart‑rate rhythms. MESOR and amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm are slightly below average (MESOR 70.7 bpm, Z = −0.45; amplitude 9.02, Z = −0.57). Although circadian fragmentation can be associated with mood symptoms, the magnitudes here are modest and their correlations with CES‑D in the sample are small.

Paragraph 4 — Aggregate diurnal heart rate pattern and physiological arousal:
Hourly deviations from mesor show the expected nighttime dips (largest negative deviations ~ −16 bpm in the early morning) and daytime peaks, with the largest average deviation centered in early afternoon (1–2 pm: +20.2 bpm, Z = 2.10). Resting heart rate is within typical range (59.8 bpm, Z = 0.20). These patterns point to preserved circadian modulation of cardiovascular arousal with a pronounced daytime peak; there is no strong wearable-derived signature (for example, chronically elevated resting heart rate or blunted amplitude) that would compellingly indicate elevated depressive symptom burden for this individual.

Paragraph 5 — Synthesis weighing evidence for low/median vs. elevated depressive symptoms:
Key weighted indicators favor placement in the lower half of the CES‑D distribution. High self‑esteem and elevated self‑reported happiness (both with moderate-to-strong inverse correlations to CES‑D) are among the strongest protective signals. Objective sleep duration and regular sleep timing further support lower risk. Behavioral markers (regular exercise, low substance use, good academic performance) add additional support for relatively low depressive symptom burden. Countervailing signals include a slightly disturbed subjective sleep score (PSQI = 6), moderate trait anxiety (STAI = 40) — which in principle is a strong correlate of CES‑D in the study but is not elevated here — and some circadian fragmentation on heart‑rate measures. Those risk signals are present but modest in magnitude and are not supported by converging evidence from several other domains.

Holistic conclusion:
On balance — giving greater weight to strong protective self‑report indicators (high self‑esteem, high happiness), adequate objective sleep, healthy behaviors, and average trait anxiety rather than extreme values on circadian fragmentation — the evidence supports that this participant’s CES‑D score is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study population distribution (i.e., relatively low or average depressive symptomatology).

69831,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"The participant’s self-report trait profile shows features generally inconsistent with elevated depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is 38 (z = -0.33), placing the participant slightly below the sample mean on anxiety proneness; conversely, self‑esteem is relatively high at 36 (z = -0.31). Perceived stress is low (score 16, z = -1.53) and current happiness is slightly below average (score 3.0, z = -0.53). The PSQI indicates mild subjective sleep disturbance (score 6, just above the common cutpoint), but its z-score is slightly below the sample mean (z = -0.33). Notably, the strongest known correlates of CES‑D in the provided data are STAI (r ≈ 0.81) and self‑esteem (r ≈ -0.71); this participant’s STAI is modest and self‑esteem is comparatively high, both signals that typically align with lower CES‑D scores.

Lifestyle and daily activity patterns reflect high social and sedentary engagement but limited formal exercise. The participant reports more than four hours a day socializing with friends (z = 2.53) and extensive music listening (z = 2.06) and internet use (z = 1.52). Time spent watching video content is elevated (2–3 hours, z = 1.91). Exercise frequency is low (no solitary or with-others exercise, z’s ≈ -1.9 and -1.6) though participation in sports is reported 1–2 times per week (z = 0.91). Alcohol use is weekly but recreational/nonprescribed drug use is absent. High social time and active recreational engagement tend to be protective or neutral with respect to depressive symptoms in this dataset (the socializing item shows a near‑zero correlation with CES‑D).

Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate generally adequate and regular sleep in objective terms. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours (z = 1.01), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep start time SD ≈ 35 minutes, z = -1.05) and no recorded daily naps (z = -0.86). The participant’s habitual sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 01:35), but consistent. The combination of objectively long, regular sleep and absence of napping contrasts with the slightly elevated subjective PSQI score; this pattern could reflect discrepancy between perceived sleep quality and objective duration/regularity rather than a sleep profile characteristic of depression (which more commonly features short or highly fragmented sleep).

Cardiovascular and circadian indicators from the Fitbit show a coherent daily rhythm and generally low physiological arousal at rest. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, z = -0.26) and the mesor is modestly below the sample mean (71.7, z = -0.31). Non‑parametric rhythm metrics show modest interdaily stability (0.38, z = -0.24) and low intradaily variability (0.44, z = -0.74), consistent with a regular, non‑fragmented activity/rest pattern. Cosinor parameters show a typical acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:43 PM) and a small-to-moderate amplitude (11.4, z = 0.2). Hourly heart‑rate deviations reveal expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations around 3–5 AM) and evening/late‑afternoon elevations (notably 6–8 PM), consistent with a stable diurnal profile and no pronounced daytime blunting or nocturnal hyperarousal.

Integrating modalities with an eye toward depressive symptomatology: the participant demonstrates several protective or neutral indicators—low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low perceived stress, substantial objective sleep duration and regularity, extensive social engagement, and a stable circadian/heart‑rate profile. Potential areas of mild concern are a slightly elevated self‑reported PSQI and a low self‑rated health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2), and an anomalously low BMI (15.6) that may reflect nutritional or measurement issues; these warrant consideration but on balance are not strong signals of high depressive symptom burden in the context of the stronger protective indicators. Given the strong predictive correlations of STAI and self‑esteem with CES‑D and the participant’s favorable scores on those measures, the multimodal evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study population distribution for CES‑D score.

44927,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Summary of self-report psychological indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile shows a mix of modest risk markers and protective social/affective resources. Trait anxiety (STAI = 40, Z ≈ -0.13) is near the sample mean and is described as “anxious” by the instrument label, but it is not markedly elevated relative to peers. Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 32, Z ≈ -0.87), and given the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D in this sample (r ≈ -0.71), this lower self-worth is a salient contributor to risk for higher depressive symptoms. Current happiness is somewhat below average (self-rating 3.0, Z ≈ -0.53), consistent with a modest affective signal in the direction of elevated depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 22, Z ≈ 0.1). Interpersonal trust is relatively high (Z ≈ 1.15), a psychosocial resource that correl inversely with CES-D (r ≈ -0.41) and therefore points away from elevated depressive burden.

Objective wearable physiology and circadian structure:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics indicate generally organized, not-disrupted daily physiology. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z ≈ -0.42), and the cosinor-derived MESOR (≈ 71.6) and amplitude (≈ 9.6; Z ≈ -0.39) are slightly below sample means but not abnormal. Non-parametric rhythm metrics (interdaily stability ≈ 0.39, intradaily variability ≈ 0.52) are close to the cohort center (Z-scores near zero), suggesting consistent day-to-day structure and limited fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm across the recording period. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected deep nocturnal heart-rate nadir and a robust morning/daytime rise (notably a large positive deviation at 7–8am, Z ≈ 1.9), which collectively imply preserved circadian activation and daytime arousal patterns rather than blunted or desynchronized physiology that sometimes associates with higher depressive symptomatology.

Sleep behavior (subjective and wearable-derived):
The participant’s subjective sleep quality falls at the conventional clinical cutoff (PSQI = 5) but their PSQI Z-score (≈ -0.8) relative to the sample indicates better-than-average perceived sleep in this cohort. Objective median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is a bit shorter than the cohort mean (median ≈ 6 h 34 m, Z ≈ -0.77) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 66 minutes, Z ≈ -0.79). Sleep onset timing is late (median start ≈ 00:59) but with only modest instability (sleep-start SD Z ≈ 0.23). Napping is rare. Overall, wearable and subjective sleep indicators do not show major disturbance or fragmentation; they reflect somewhat short but regularly patterned sleep, which is not strongly supportive of elevated depressive symptom burden in this individual.

Behavioral lifestyle and functioning:
The participant reports low substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs) and high engagement in organized physical activity (sports three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.58). Socializing is moderate (≈1–2 hours daily), and recreational screen use patterns show more time listening to music (2–3 hours) than passive TV or gaming. Academic performance in prior terms is strong (GPA values around 3.7–3.8, with one lower semester at 3.37). These behavioral markers — regular vigorous activity, low substance use, ongoing social contact and preserved academic functioning — are protective against higher CES-D scores in the cohort (correlations for exercise and social resources trend negative or near zero with CES-D).

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
Risk-related signals are present but modest in magnitude. The most notable internal indicators that point toward increased depressive symptoms are lower self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ -0.87) and slightly lower self-reported happiness; both of these traits are relatively strong correlates of CES-D in this sample. Trait anxiety is close to average rather than markedly elevated. In contrast, a set of objective and behavioral markers argue against a high depressive burden: preserved circadian heart-rate structure, a robust morning daytime cardiac activation pattern, low resting heart rate, generally good subjective sleep quality, frequent sports participation, low substance use, and positive interpersonal trust. On balance, the protected functional profile (regular activity, low substance use, consistent rhythms, reasonable academic performance) appears to outweigh the moderate self-report vulnerabilities. Therefore, when integrating subjective symptoms, trait measures, objective physiology, and behavioral functioning, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s overall CES-D score is more consistent with the lower or average range of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

71894,34.0,0.9559585492227979,"Self-report measures indicate pronounced affective and trait risk factors that are commonly associated with higher depressive symptomatology. The participant reports very elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 64, Z = 2.24), markedly low global self-esteem (Rosenberg = 19, Z = -2.7), and low momentary happiness (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61). These three measures have substantial correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.81; SelfEsteem r ≈ -0.70; Happy r ≈ -0.46), and thus provide strong evidence that the participant’s affective and cognitive self-reports co-vary with higher depressive symptoms in this population. Additional self-report indicators that align with increased symptom burden include low health satisfaction (score 1.67, Z ≈ -1.95) and relatively low interpersonal trust (score Z ≈ -1.42, r with CES-D ≈ -0.41).

Behavioral and lifestyle data show a mix of risk and protective features. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.07) and moderate social activity with friends (3–4 hours, Z ≈ 1.74), both of which are generally protective against depressive symptoms and have weak negative correlations with CES-D in this dataset. Substance use is minimal. Conversely, the participant reports high recreational screen time (internet usage and listening to music >4 hours, Zs ≈ 2.06–2.19; correlations with CES-D ≈ 0.24), which in this sample is modestly associated with higher CES-D scores. Overall, behavioral patterns are heterogeneous: engagement in exercise and social contact may buffer mood risk, while high passive media engagement is a potential behavioral correlate of elevated symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics suggest relatively preserved circadian regularity but only mildly short sleep duration. Median nightly sleep is about 6 hours 43 minutes (Z ≈ -0.58), with sleep timing around 23:55 and moderate night-to-night variability (sleep SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z ≈ -1.06). Subjective sleep quality is slightly disturbed (PSQI = 6), but correlations between sleep duration/variability and CES-D are small in this dataset. Circadian analysis of heart rate shows a moderately stable daily rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.47, Z ≈ 0.5; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ 1.48), modest intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.81), a slightly elevated mesor (mean HR ≈ 80.9, Z ≈ 0.95) and reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -0.75). Hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and pronounced morning elevation (very large positive deviation around 6–8am, Zs > 4), consistent with robust morning activation. Wearable features (resting HR and mesor) have small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), but overall the physiological profile does not show the severe circadian disruption or markedly reduced amplitude that in this sample most strongly distinguishes high CES-D cases.

Weighing the multimodal evidence: the strongest indicators pointing toward elevated CES-D scores are the large effect-size self-report signals (high trait anxiety, very low self-esteem, and low happiness) that have strong correlations with CES-D in the study population. These psychological markers outweigh the mixed behavioral and wearable signals, which include several protective factors (frequent exercise, substantial socializing) and only mild sleep shortening or circadian irregularity. Because the most salient and high-precision measures (trait anxiety and self-esteem) are both extreme relative to the sample and strongly associated with CES-D, the overall pattern more strongly supports higher-than-median depressive symptom burden in this participant.

30453,31.0,0.9196891191709845,"Trait and symptom self-report indicates a profile consistent with elevated internalizing symptom burden. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 51, Z = 0.96) is moderately high and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), indicating that higher chronic anxiety for this individual is a robust predictor of greater depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 27, Z = -1.57) and shows a strong inverse relationship with CES-D (r = -0.70), such that lower self-worth here is another substantial indicator of elevated depressive symptoms. Self-rated happiness is low (current = 2.0, Z = -1.61; r = -0.46), and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38; r = 0.28), both aligning with a pattern of increased affective distress.

Sleep-related data provide convergent evidence for elevated symptom burden. The participant reports very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 16, Z = 4.29), an extreme deviation from the sample mean and a well-established correlate of mood disturbance. Objective wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly duration of ~6 h 25 min (Z = -0.96), a late median sleep start (01:21), and high night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 145 min, Z = 1.0) and moderate variability in sleep start time (SD = 95 min, Z = 0.26). Variability in sleep timing/duration is positively associated with CES-D in this dataset (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.19; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.22), and the combination of subjective disturbance plus short, irregular sleep supports higher depressive symptomatology.

Physiological and circadian measures are broadly consistent with modest dysregulation. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (67.5 bpm, Z = 1.11; r = 0.19), and the cosinor-derived mesor is above average (80.2, Z = 0.85), both weakly positively associated with CES-D. Circadian amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude = 8.82, Z = -0.63) and intradaily variability is slightly elevated (IV = 0.63, Z = 0.6), which can reflect blunted/less stable diurnal physiological rhythms; correlations with CES-D are small but point in the expected direction (amplitude r ≈ -0.10; IV r ≈ -0.06). Hourly aggregate deviations from mesor show typical nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations in heart rate with a late-afternoon acrophase (~3:51 PM), without strong, CES-D–related deviations in specific hours.

Behavioral and social factors present a mixed pattern of protective and risk-associated elements. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports (exercising with others and sports: three times/week or more; Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58 respectively) — activities that, in this sample, trend toward lower CES-D (r ≈ -0.16 to -0.24) and may buffer risk. Alcohol and recreational drug use are absent (Z-scores notably negative), which is protective. Conversely, socializing time is below average (≈31 minutes/hour, Z = -0.62) and interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are relatively low (trust Z = -1.1, health satisfaction Z = -1.11; both correlated with higher CES-D), suggesting limited perceived social support or satisfaction. High reported time listening to music and reading (Z = 2.06 and 2.28) may reflect solitary or ruminative leisure patterns; these show small positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset.

Integrated assessment and ranking: weighing the strongest and most predictive indicators in this multimodal profile—particularly the high trait anxiety (STAI; r = 0.81), low self-esteem (RSES; r = -0.70), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 4.29), low self-reported happiness, and supportive physiological signs (elevated resting HR and sleep irregularity)—the preponderance of evidence favors an elevated depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. Protective signals (frequent exercise/sports, no substance use) are present but appear insufficient, given the magnitude of the anxiety, self-esteem, and sleep disturbances, to shift the balance toward lower symptom levels. On balance, the likelihood is that this participant’s CES-D score would fall in the upper half of the study distribution.

66047,46.0,0.9948186528497409,"Self-report measures indicate multiple psychosocial risk signals that are commonly associated with higher depressive symptom burden. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 73, Z = 3.13) is extremely elevated relative to the study sample and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), indicating this is a highly salient indicator of concurrent depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is notably low (RSES = 21, Z = -2.42; r with CES-D = -0.70), which is one of the larger negative correlates in the dataset and likewise suggests vulnerability to elevated depressive symptomatology. Current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), perceived stress is above average (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), and satisfaction with physical health is very low (Z = -2.28); taken together these subjective reports form a consistent pattern of affective distress and low well-being that converges with the anxiety and self-esteem signals.

Sleep-related data show a mixed objective/subjective profile that tends toward markers associated with increased depressive symptoms. Subjectively reported sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52, classified as disturbed sleep). Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is near the sample mean (7 h 15 m, Z = 0.08), but timing and regularity are notable: the median sleep start time is very late (about 2:40 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 84 minutes, sleep duration SD ≈ 106 minutes). Daytime napping is elevated (mean daily naps Z = 2.4). Late and unstable sleep timing combined with disturbed subjective sleep are behavioral patterns that often co-occur with higher CES-D scores, even when total nightly duration alone is within a typical range.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian metrics provide additional information about physiological state and daily structure. Resting heart rate and the cosinor mesor are both elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 68.4 bpm, Z = 1.22; Mesor = 80.2, Z = 0.85), which can reflect heightened autonomic arousal; these metrics have modest positive correlations with CES-D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.18–0.19). Circadian summary measures are not severely disrupted but show modestly reduced amplitude (Z = -0.31) and only average interdaily stability (0.43, Z = 0.17) with low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = -0.28), suggesting a daily rhythm that is present but somewhat blunted/less regular than some peers. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations indicate the expected night-time troughs and daytime increases, with somewhat higher-than-average deviations around late night/early morning and a mid-morning/late-afternoon elevation; these hourly values have small correlations with CES-D overall. The combination of elevated baseline cardiovascular indices and a mildly blunted circadian amplitude aligns with the self-report pattern of elevated anxiety and disturbed sleep.

Behavioral habit indicators are consistent with reduced daytime activation and more sedentary leisure patterns. The participant reports very low frequency of exercise (both alone and with others, Z values approximately -1.2 to -1.6) and no team sports; social exercise is absent. Leisure activities show high passive media time (watching TV/videos Z = 3.17; internet use Z = 2.19) and little engagement in active or social hobbies. These behavioral patterns (low physical activity, high passive screen time, limited social/leisure engagement) are modestly related to higher CES-D in the sample and reinforce the overall signal from affective and sleep measures.

Evidence pointing to higher CES-D (top half): very large indicators (extremely high trait anxiety, very low self-esteem) that have the strongest correlations with CES-D in this dataset; poor subjective sleep and late/variable sleep timing with elevated napping; low reported happiness and health satisfaction; elevated resting heart rate/mesor indicating physiological arousal; low exercise and high sedentary media use. Evidence that would point away from elevated CES-D (bottom half or average) is weaker: objective median sleep duration is average and circadian stability measures are not profoundly disrupted. However, these countervailing data are relatively modest in magnitude and do not outweigh the strong, highly correlated psychosocial indicators.

Holistic synthesis and final assessment: the participant presents with multiple large-magnitude self-report risk indicators that are among the strongest correlates of CES-D in the sample (notably trait anxiety and low self-esteem), accompanied by disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, elevated resting heart rate, increased napping, and low physical/social activity. Although objective total sleep time and some circadian measures are not extreme, the convergence of several high-risk signals—especially the very high STAI and very low self-esteem—supports the conclusion that this participant’s CES-D score is likely in the higher half of the study distribution.

79834,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Self-report psychological traits and symptom indicators: On trait measures the participant shows characteristics generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI) is below the sample mean (score 37, Z ≈ -0.43) despite a strong positive population correlation between STAI and CES‑D; Rosenberg self‑esteem is high (score 37, Z ≈ -0.17) and the population correlation between self‑esteem and CES‑D is strongly negative (r ≈ -0.71), which together are robust protective signals against higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS score 19, Z ≈ -0.71) and satisfaction with physical health is above average (Z ≈ 0.55), both features that, in this cohort, align with lower CES‑D scores. Counterbalancing these protective indicators are somewhat lower self‑reported current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and markedly low interpersonal trust (Z ≈ -1.42), each of which is modestly correlated with CES‑D in the sample; these suggest areas of social-emotional vulnerability but are smaller in magnitude than the protective traits described above.

Sleep: Wearable and subjective sleep metrics present a mixed pattern. Objectively, the participant averaged relatively long nocturnal sleep (median 8 h 18 min, Z ≈ +1.39) with low mean naps and moderate night‑to‑night consistency. However, self‑reported sleep quality (PSQI = 6) exceeds the common cutoff for disturbed sleep and indicates perceived sleep difficulties despite long duration. Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 00:46) and variability in start time is modestly lower than average (Z ≈ -0.68). In the context of CES‑D, subjective sleep disturbance is more directly linked to depressive symptoms than duration alone; here the combination of long objective sleep and subjective disturbance points to sleep dissatisfaction rather than gross insomnia or extreme sleep loss.

Physiological circadian and cardiac patterns: Heart‑rate derived circadian measures suggest a reasonably structured circadian profile. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.33) but intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -0.95), and autocorrelation at 24 h is above average (Z ≈ +0.64), together indicating repeatable daily structure with low fragmentation. Mesor and resting heart rate are lower than the study mean (mesor 69.8 bpm, resting HR 52.9 bpm; both Z ≈ -0.6), and amplitude is modestly elevated (Z ≈ +0.56) with an acrophase in the late afternoon/early evening (≈5:23 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate and afternoon/evening peaks (notably 6–7 PM and 9–10 PM). These physiological markers do not strongly track CES‑D in the sample (small correlations), but they are consistent with a physiologically restful baseline (low resting HR) and intact day–night differentiation rather than the blunted or highly fragmented rhythms sometimes associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports low engagement in organized exercise and team sports (minimal frequency, Zs ≤ -1.1), limited solo exercise, and low use of recreational drugs or beer; alcohol use via wine/liquor is relatively frequent (three times a week or more; Z ≈ +1.68). Social time with friends is within a moderate range (about 1–2 hours/day). Academic performance indicators (GPAs) are high. These behavioral features present a mixed risk profile: limited physical activity and some evening alcohol use can be associated with higher depressive symptoms, but strong academic functioning, low perceived stress, and healthy body mass index argue against broad functional impairment.

Integration and weighting of evidence regarding CES‑D position: Indicators most strongly associated with CES‑D in this dataset (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) point toward a lower symptom burden for this participant: STAI is below average while self‑esteem is relatively high, and self‑esteem has a strong inverse correlation with CES‑D. Additional supportive evidence for a lower CES‑D score includes below‑average perceived stress, above‑average health satisfaction, objective indicators of cardiac restfulness (low resting HR), stable sleep duration, and preserved circadian structure. Contrary signals include a PSQI score indicating subjective sleep disturbance, lower reported happiness, low interpersonal trust, limited physical activity, and some evening alcohol use; however, these signals are smaller in magnitude or have weaker sample correlations with CES‑D than the protective indicators. On balance, the preponderance and effect sizes of the available measures favor placement of this participant’s depressive symptom burden in the lower half of the study distribution.

33133,31.0,0.9196891191709845,"Summary of self-report affective and trait measures:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) and moderately elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), alongside reduced current happiness (score = 3, Z = -0.53). These measures align with constructs that commonly covary with depressive symptom burden; the STAI in this dataset shows a particularly strong positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.81). At the same time, the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 37, Z ≈ -0.17), and above-average satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = 0.8), both of which are protective in relation to depressive symptomatology (self-esteem here is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D, r ≈ -0.71). Overall, affective self-report is mixed but notable for elevated anxiety and stress—two strong risk correlates with higher CES-D scores—counterbalanced by reasonably high self-esteem and health satisfaction.

Sleep and circadian findings:
Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98; classified as disturbed sleep), indicating substantial sleep complaints. Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 38 min (Z = -0.68), with modest night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 63 minutes, Z = -0.85) and a late median sleep start time (~00:40) with moderate variability (sleep-start SD ≈ 101 minutes, Z = 0.39). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a preserved but somewhat attenuated diurnal heart-rate rhythm (amplitude slightly below population mean, Z = -0.22) with modestly elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.63, Z = 0.6) and near-average interdaily stability (IS ≈ 0.40, Z ≈ -0.08). The subjective report of poor sleep combined with late bed timing and modestly increased rhythm fragmentation are patterns that have been associated with greater depressive symptoms in prior work and in the current dataset.

Behavioral activity and social habits:
The participant reports regular exercise (exercised alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) but not exercising with others (Z = -1.58), moderate social contact (socializing 1–2 hours, Z ≈ 0.16), and elevated discretionary internet use (3–4 hours, Z = 1.52). Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), and there is no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Exercise frequency is a potential protective factor; however, exercising primarily alone and relatively high internet use may reflect limited social engagement in structured activities. Several behavioral indicators (internet time, solitary exercise) show small positive correlations with CES-D in this sample.

Physiological heart-rate summary:
Resting heart rate is low-to-typical for the sample (RHR ≈ 58.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.05). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show a clear nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and a morning peak (largest positive deviation ~8–9 AM), indicating an intact diurnal cardiovascular profile. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly low (0.29, Z ≈ -0.28), consistent with somewhat reduced day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms. Together, the heart-rate physiology indicates a broadly normal daily pattern but with slightly dampened amplitude and modest rhythm irregularity—features that, when present with sleep disturbance and elevated anxiety, can accompany higher depressive symptom scores.

Integrated interpretation and likelihood of elevated CES-D:
The data present a mixed but concerning profile with respect to depressive symptom burden. Key signals associated with higher CES-D risk are present: elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset), clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI well above typical cutoffs and high relative to peers), and moderately elevated perceived stress. Protective signals include relatively high self-esteem, above-average health satisfaction, regular exercise, and good academic performance. Wearable physiology does not show severe dysregulation but does indicate slightly reduced circadian amplitude and modest fragmentation. Taken together, the weight of evidence—especially the combination of high trait anxiety and substantial subjective sleep disturbance, both of which have strong associations with higher CES-D scores in this sample—leans toward a higher depressive symptom burden relative to the study population.

47810,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"Summary of self-reported psychological traits and symptoms:
The participant’s trait measures show a mixed pattern with several protective features. Trait anxiety (STAI = 37, z = -0.43) is below the study mean and is classified as “not anxious,” and global self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, z = 0.11). These two measures are strongly associated with depressive symptom levels in this sample (STAI and CES-D correlation = 0.81; self-esteem correlation = -0.71) and therefore represent relatively robust indicators of lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is only slightly above average (PSS = 22, z = 0.1), and current happiness is somewhat lower than average (happy = 3.0, z = -0.53), which may signal transient low mood but not necessarily high chronic symptomatology on its own.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
The participant reports low substance use and engages in physical activity modestly (exercise and sports ~1–2 times per week; exercise z-scores between 0.32 and 0.91), which are behaviors typically associated with lower depressive burden. Social activity metrics are below the study mean (socializing z = -0.62), and health satisfaction is lower than average (z = -0.7), both of which can relate to greater depressive symptoms but have only moderate correlations with CES-D in this dataset (health satisfaction correlation = -0.39). Overall, the behavioral profile shows some social and health-satisfaction vulnerabilities but also protective engagement in exercise and limited substance use.

Sleep and circadian behavioral patterns:
Objective sleep features indicate suboptimal sleep quantity and timing. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 40 minutes (z = -0.65), with a median sleep onset around 01:26 AM and moderate night-to-night variability (sleep SD ~106 minutes). Subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05, classified as disturbed), a pattern that is commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in many studies. The participant also shows an above-average frequency of short naps (mean daily naps = 0.27, z = 2.34), which here correlates modestly with CES-D (r = 0.21). Combined, late sleep timing, shorter median sleep, poor subjective sleep quality, and increased napping point toward sleep-related risk factors that can heighten depressive symptom burden even when other protective traits are present.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics:
Heart-rate–derived circadian summary measures are mixed. The participant’s interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.40, z = -0.08), but intradaily variability is elevated (0.83, z = 2.01), indicating greater fragmentation of hourly heart-rate patterns across the day. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm, z = -0.22), and the MESOR and amplitude of the fitted rhythm are near or slightly above average (MESOR z = 0.17; amplitude z = 0.52). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations in heart rate, with larger-than-average evening peaks (6–9 pm hours z ≈ 1.0–1.2). Elevated intradaily variability (fragmented rhythms) and increased evening arousal may be physiologically relevant to mood regulation, though correlations between these specific wearable features and CES-D in this sample are generally small.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
The data present a mixture of protective and risk indicators. Strong protective signals are low trait anxiety and high self-esteem—both of which have large sample correlations with CES-D and would be expected to lower the probability of elevated depressive symptoms. Counterbalancing those protections are notable sleep disturbances (PSQI = 9), later-than-typical sleep timing, increased napping, reduced health satisfaction, and some circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability). Subjective happiness is somewhat below average and perceived stress is modestly elevated. Because CES-D is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms and strongly tracks with trait anxiety and self-esteem in this population, the relatively low anxiety and high self-esteem are influential indicators favoring a lower CES-D score. The sleep and circadian disturbances represent meaningful risk factors but—given the strength of the protective trait measures and modest size of other risk correlations—these risks are more consistent with subclinical or situational symptoms rather than an overall CES-D score well into the upper half of the cohort distribution.

Conclusion (probabilistic grouping):
Weighing the stronger trait-protective signals (low STAI, high self-esteem) against the moderate sleep and wellbeing risks, the balance of evidence favors the participant having a CES-D score at or below the population median rather than in the top half of the distribution.

58196,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Summary of self-report measures and psychosocial functioning: The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple indicators typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) is below the study mean, self-reported happiness is relatively high (Happy = 5.0, Z = 1.64), and self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES Z = 1.1). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26) classifies subjective sleep quality as “good.” Academic performance (GPA) is high, perceived health satisfaction is above average (Z = 1.38), and the participant reports frequent exercise (three times a week or more, Z > 1). These measures that are negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample (notably self-esteem, happiness, and low anxiety) point toward lower depressive symptomatology for this individual.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac indicators: Heart rate–based circadian summary measures indicate a generally regular daytime activity pattern with a typical acrophase in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM) and a relatively low mesor and resting heart rate (Mesor Z = -1.01; RHR = 53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56). Amplitude is somewhat reduced (Z = -0.63) and interdaily stability is below average (Z = -0.57), while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.81). These rhythm features suggest somewhat lower average cardiac activation but a modestly more fragmented day-to-day structure. Importantly, correlations between these circadian/heart-rate features and CES-D are small in magnitude in this sample (all near zero), indicating that the observed wearable profile does not provide strong evidence for elevated depressive symptoms in this participant.

Sleep and daily timing patterns: Objective sleep duration from the wearable has a median of ~6 h 33 min (Z = -0.79), a sleep start time around 1:02 AM, and moderate night-to-night variability (SD ~82 min). Although nightly sleep duration is slightly shorter than the sample mean and the participant has a relatively late habitual sleep onset, subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is rated as good and sleep-related metrics show only weak correlations with CES-D in the dataset. There is a small positive correlation between variability in sleep timing and CES-D (r ≈ 0.22), but this participant’s overall combination of objectively shorter sleep with intact subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning reduces the weight of short sleep as evidence for elevated depressive symptoms.

Behavioral risk and protective factors: The participant reports routine engagement in protective behaviors—regular exercise, moderate socializing, limited recreational drug use, and moderate alcohol consumption— alongside strong academic performance and high health satisfaction. Perceived stress is somewhat elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), which is a potential risk factor given its positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.28). However, the magnitude of stress is moderate and is counterbalanced by robust protective signals (high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, good self-rated health and happiness, frequent exercise). Wearable indicators do not show physiologic hyperarousal (RHR is low) or nocturnal elevation that might suggest sustained physiological stress.

Holistic interpretation and balance of evidence: Taking the multimodal data together, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden: low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep quality, frequent exercise, strong academic functioning, and wearable physiologic measures consistent with a predominantly normative diurnal pattern (low resting heart rate, afternoon acrophase). The principal counter-evidence—moderate perceived stress, slightly short objective sleep duration, and increased intradaily variability—are either of modest magnitude or have weak sample-level correlations with CES-D. On balance, the preponderance of psychosocial and physiological indicators supports the participant being in the lower half of CES-D scores within this study population.

62246,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Self-report instruments and symptom-focused measures indicate a profile more consistent with lower-than-average depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is in the low range (score 33, Z = -0.82) and the STAI–trait to CES-D correlation is large and positive (r ≈ 0.81), meaning low anxiety in this participant predicts lower CES-D in the sample. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.96; note the absolute score labeling appears inconsistent with the scale range but the standardized value indicates higher self-regard relative to peers) and this variable is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), which supports lower depressive symptoms. Current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53) and perceived stress is near average (PSS Z ≈ -0.17), each with modest correlations to CES-D in expected directions (happiness negatively, stress positively). Overall, the pattern of low anxiety and relatively high self-esteem carries substantial weight toward lower depressive symptomatology.

Lifestyle and activity reports reinforce a generally adaptive behavioral profile. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ 1.07) and participates in social and team activities at least weekly; exercise variables have modest negative correlations with CES-D in the sample. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0), while non-prescribed and recreational drug use are essentially absent. Daily socializing and recreational screen time are low-to-moderate; time spent on sedentary hobbies is short. Self-rated health satisfaction is above average (Z ≈ 0.63), which is negatively associated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.39). Together, these behavioral indicators (regular exercise, social engagement, health satisfaction, low drug use) are more characteristic of lower depressive symptom burden.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate a structured, regular daily rhythm with limited fragmentation. Non-parametric circadian features show moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.25) and low intradaily variability (Z = -1.59), suggesting consistent day-to-day timing of activity/arousal and relatively little within-day fragmentation — patterns that, in this sample, are not strongly associated with higher CES-D (correlations near zero). Cosinor parameters show a modestly elevated mesor and amplitude (mesor Z = 0.56; amplitude Z = 0.47) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:23 PM), consistent with a typical diurnal activity/heart rate profile. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57 bpm, Z = -0.14). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal trough and daytime elevations; correlations between these hourly deviations and CES-D are small and inconsistent. Overall, heart-rate–based circadian structure and physiological arousal patterns do not provide evidence of marked dysregulation linked to higher depressive symptoms in this participant.

Objective sleep metrics from the wearable and subjective sleep reports converge on adequate, regular sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 39 minutes (Z = 0.59), sleep duration variability is relatively low (SD 65 minutes, Z = -0.82), median sleep onset near midnight, and mean daily naps are essentially absent (Z = -0.86). The PSQI score is low (score = 3, Z = -1.72), classed as “good sleep,” indicating little self-reported sleep disturbance. Sleep regularity and duration are both variables that, in population analyses, tend to associate with CES-D, and in this case they align with lower risk (the available correlations for wearable sleep metrics are near zero or small). In sum, both subjective and objective sleep features are consistent with a lower depressive symptom profile.

Weighing the evidence holistically: strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety with a large positive correlation to CES-D, high self-esteem with a large negative correlation to CES-D), regular exercise and social activity, above-average health satisfaction, structured circadian rhythms with low fragmentation, and objectively adequate sleep collectively point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. Countervailing signals are minimal — current happiness is slightly below average and perceived stress is near average, but these are modest in magnitude and do not offset the stronger protective signals. Therefore the most parsimonious placement of this participant within the study distribution is in the lower half for CES-D scores.

55424,35.0,0.9637305699481865,"The self-report profile indicates notable affective and cognitive risk features that align with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant scores high on trait anxiety (STAI = 57, Z = 1.55), a measure that shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.81), and reports low momentary happiness (Current Happy = 2, Z = -1.61, r with CES-D = -0.45) and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87, r = -0.71). Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI = 14, Z = 3.37, classified as disturbed sleep), which, given PSQI’s established links to mood, is likely to co-occur with higher depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38), and health satisfaction and interpersonal trust are in the average-to-slightly-above-average range; these factors provide limited buffering but do not offset the strength of the anxiety/self-esteem/sleep signals.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics present a mixed picture of physiological regulation. Circadian regularity is near the sample mean (interdaily stability = 0.42, Z = 0.09) and fragmentation is modestly lower than average (intradaily variability = 0.48, Z = -0.46), suggesting relatively structured day–night patterns. Resting heart rate (57.6 bpm, Z = -0.07) and mesor (72.96 bpm, Z = -0.13) are close to the cohort average, while amplitude is slightly elevated (11.82, Z = 0.34) and the acrophase is mid-afternoon (3:36 PM), indicating normal daytime cardiovascular activation. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected deep nocturnal trough (-20 bpm range around 2–5 AM) and pronounced afternoon–evening increases (peaking 3–8 PM with Z-scores up to ~1.4). Overall, the wearable physiology does not show pronounced dysregulation (for example, no elevated resting HR or severe circadian fragmentation) that would independently indicate high depressive burden; however, modest correlations between several cardiac features and CES-D (mostly small positive values) mean these wearable signals are neutral-to-mildly supportive of subjective risk rather than strongly contradictory.

Sleep behavior shows an important discrepancy between objective and subjective indices. Objectively, the participant has an adequate median nightly sleep duration (7 h 24 min, Z = 0.27), relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 69 min, Z = -0.72) and reasonably stable sleep onset timing (median start ~00:21, SD ~58 min, Z = -0.54). Yet subjectively the participant reports very poor sleep quality (PSQI = 14, Z = 3.37). There is also a notably elevated rate of napping (mean daily naps = 0.24, Z = 1.90), which correlates modestly with higher CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.19). This pattern—objectively sufficient and regular sleep paired with high self-reported disturbance and increased daytime napping—frequently accompanies mood symptoms characterized by fatigue, perceived nonrestorative sleep, and daytime dysfunction.

Behavioral and social activity indicators are mixed in terms of risk and resilience. The participant reports frequent exercise with others (three times per week or more, Z = 1.23), which is generally protective for mood, and academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high 3.8–3.9 range). Alcohol and other substance use are low-to-moderate, and sedentary leisure is somewhat elevated (sedentary hobby Z = 0.82) while time socializing is below average (Z = -0.62). The combination of active social exercise participation and high academic functioning provides resilience, but relatively lower general socializing and higher sedentary hobby time offer less support against mood symptoms. Taken together, activity patterns lend some protective influence but do not fully counterbalance the strong subjective affective signals.

Weighing the totality of evidence yields a higher likelihood that this participant’s CES-D score would fall in the upper half of the study distribution. Strong predictors that are highly correlated with CES-D (notably trait anxiety, r = 0.81, and low self-esteem, r = -0.71) are pronounced in this case, and subjective sleep disturbance is markedly elevated (PSQI Z = 3.37), a frequent co-occurring feature of higher depressive symptom burden. Objective wearable data and several behavioral strengths (regular sleep duration, stable circadian indices, frequent group exercise, high GPA) provide partial counterevidence but are of smaller magnitude or weaker correlation with CES-D than the prominent self-report risk markers. On balance, the pattern of high anxiety, low self-esteem, low self-reported happiness, and severe subjective sleep disturbance outweighs the protective signals, supporting classification in the top half of the sample for depressive symptoms.

23576,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Trait and symptom self-report indicates a generally low-to-moderate affective burden. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72) is below the sample mean and the instrument’s correlation with CES-D is high (r = 0.81), which provides strong evidence that anxiety-related risk for depressive symptoms is low for this individual. Self‑esteem is elevated relative to the cohort (RSES Z = 0.96; note the scale value reported appears above the typical range but the Z-score indicates high self‑esteem), and self‑esteem has a substantial negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), suggesting a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Subjective happiness is modestly below average (Current Happy Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17), but these are smaller effects compared with the low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem.

Lifestyle and activity indicators are largely consistent with lower risk for elevated depressive symptoms. The participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use (Z-scores between -0.11 and -1.30), and exercises frequently (exercised alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07). Socializing time is near average and sedentary hobby engagement is low. Academic performance is high (GPAs near 4.0). These behavioral patterns—regular exercise, minimal substance use, and strong academic functioning—are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden in student samples and are supported by small-to-moderate negative correlations of exercise and social factors with CES-D in the dataset.

Sleep quantity, variability, and circadian regularity as measured by the wearable are generally favorable. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 46 min (Z = 0.72), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep start time are low (sleep SD Z = -0.98; start time SD Z = -0.83), which suggests consistent sleep timing and duration. The PSQI score (6.0) crosses the common threshold for “disturbed sleep,” but its Z = -0.33 indicates the participant’s subjective sleep problems are not markedly above peers; the wearable data (adequate duration and low variability) point toward relatively stable sleep behavior. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate also reflect regular rhythms: interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z = 0.50), autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z = 1.06), intradaily variability is modest (Z = 0.24), and amplitude and MESOR are near the cohort mean. Overall, these markers align with well-entrained daily structure rather than the flattened or irregular rhythms often associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Physiological cardiac patterns show a clear nocturnal trough and a daytime peak consistent with typical diurnal autonomic tone. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm, Z = -0.07) and mesor (71.4 bpm, Z = -0.35) is slightly below average. Hourly deviations from mesor show large negative deviations overnight (e.g., -16 to -19 bpm between ~2–6 AM) and daytime positive deviations peaking mid-to-late afternoon (acrophase ≈ 4:05 PM). The pattern indicates robust nocturnal dipping and a pronounced daytime rise rather than a blunted circadian profile; correlations between many heart-rate circadian features and CES‑D are small in this sample. Taken together, wearable physiology supports an interpretation of preserved daily autonomic structure rather than the dysregulated physiological pattern often linked to elevated depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and CES‑D group assignment: multiple relatively strong protective indicators point toward lower depressive symptom burden. The most diagnostic signals in this dataset—low trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES‑D), high self‑esteem (strong negative correlation), regular and sufficient sleep (wearable-derived), frequent exercise, minimal substance use, and coherent circadian physiology—collectively argue for CES‑D scores below the population median. Limited adverse signals (PSQI just above the clinical threshold, slightly lower self-reported happiness) are present but are smaller in magnitude and less strongly linked to CES‑D in the provided correlations than the protective measures. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classification in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

93485,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Summary of self-report measures: The participant reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) and elevated self-esteem (RSES Z = +0.82), both characteristics that, given their strong correlations with CES-D in this sample (STAI r = +0.81; Self-esteem r = -0.71), point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is slightly below the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.44) and self-rated happiness is somewhat below average (Happy Z = -0.53); the modest decrease in reported happiness is a potential signal in the direction of depressive symptoms, but its correlation with CES-D is moderate (r = -0.46) and the participant’s other affective indicators (low anxiety, high self-esteem, low stress) are more consistently protective. Health satisfaction is high (Z = +1.8), which also aligns with lower CES-D (r = -0.39).

Sleep and daily habits: Subjective and wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate generally adequate sleep duration and quality. Median nightly sleep is about 7 hours (Z = -0.20) and PSQI scores classify the participant in the “good sleep” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Sleep timing is near midnight (median start ~00:58) with moderate night-to-night variability but no frequent naps. Regular exercise is reported (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z = +1.07), limited use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs, and moderate social time. These behavioral features (adequate sleep, regular exercise, limited drug use) align with lower risk for elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian profile: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a pronounced and regular diurnal pattern. Amplitude is high (Z = +1.9) and 24-hour autocorrelation/interdaily stability are above average (autocorr24h Z = +1.23; interdaily stability Z = +1.0), indicating a stable, robust circadian rhythm. Resting heart rate is low (47.3 bpm, Z = -1.29). The aggregated hourly deviations show strong nocturnal reductions in heart rate and daytime elevations concentrated in late morning to early afternoon (acrophase ~4:00 PM; several midday hours with high positive deviations and Z-scores). In this dataset, greater circadian amplitude and rhythm regularity are not positively associated with higher CES-D (amplitude r ≈ -0.10; interdaily stability r ≈ 0.0), so the participant’s strong circadian structure more likely reflects physiological resilience or healthy behavioral regularity than depressive symptom burden.

Integration and salient signals: The most influential signals in the available data that predict lower CES-D are elevated self-esteem (strong negative correlation with CES-D), low trait anxiety, high health satisfaction, consistent exercise, adequate sleep quality, and a pronounced, stable circadian rhythm with low resting heart rate. Potentially concerning features are limited: a mildly lower self-reported happiness score and moderate alcohol consumption (1–2 times/week), but these features either have weaker correlations with CES-D in this sample or are small in magnitude for this participant. Overall, the convergent pattern across psychological traits, health satisfaction, sleep, activity, and circadian physiology points toward lower depressive symptomatology relative to the study population.

Assessment relative to the sample distribution: Considering (a) strong protective trait-level indicators (high self-esteem, low anxiety), (b) good sleep and health satisfaction, (c) regular exercise and stable circadian physiology, and (d) the direction and strength of sample correlations linking these measures to CES-D, the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not in the top 50% for depressive symptom burden).

62617,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"Self-report indicators of affect and trait risk: Across multiple self-report instruments the participant shows a profile generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is well below the study mean (score = 28, Z = −1.31; classified as ""not anxious""), and the participant reports relatively high self-esteem (Z = 1.24) and above-average current happiness (Z = 1.64). Perceived stress is below average for the sample (PSS Z = −1.26), and interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are modestly higher than peers. In the study correlations provided, anxiety and low self-esteem are among the strongest predictors of CES-D score (STAI r = 0.81; self-esteem r = −0.71), and the participant’s low-anxiety / high-self-esteem profile therefore favors a lower CES-D score.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Alcohol use is low-to-moderate, socializing is present but not extreme, and daily sedentary/leisure screen time is limited. Academic performance (GPAs above 3.5) and low nap frequency are additional functional markers. These lifestyle features (regular exercise, social engagement, lower substance use, maintained academic functioning) are typically protective against higher depressive symptomatology and align with the self-report indicators above.

Sleep and wearable-derived sleep/HR patterns: Objective sleep summary from the Fitbit indicates consistently long nightly sleep (median 8 h 25 min, Z = 1.53) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD Z ≈ −0.51). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5) is at the border of the commonly used cutoff but is slightly better than the sample average. The participant has few naps. These sleep characteristics—long, relatively consistent sleep with modest subjective disturbance—would not generally point toward elevated depressive symptoms in this sample.

Circadian and cardiovascular signals: Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a modestly elevated mesor and resting heart rate (mesor Z = 0.58; RHR Z = 0.29), but a relatively low amplitude of the fitted rhythm (amplitude Z = −1.01) and low interdaily stability (Z = −1.73). Acrophase (peak of the cardiac rhythm) is around 5:03 PM, and hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and daytime/evening elevations with largest deviations in the evening hours. Low interdaily stability suggests less consistent day-to-day timing of activity/physiology, and reduced amplitude indicates a smaller day–night difference in heart-rate rhythm. However, correlations between these wearable circadian measures and CES-D in the study are small; for example, amplitude and interdaily stability show weak correlations with CES-D in the provided data. Overall, the wearable signals provide mixed information: some circadian flattening is present (potentially a weak risk marker), but effect sizes linking these wearable features to CES-D are small in this sample and other indicators (self-report, sleep, activity) point toward lower symptom burden.

Integration and assessment of CES-D placement: Synthesizing across modalities, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, below-average perceived stress, regular exercise, good academic functioning, and objectively long and regular sleep—factors associated with lower CES-D scores. Wearable circadian findings show some reduction in amplitude and day-to-day stability, which could be a subtle risk signal, but the magnitudes of these deviations are modest and their correlations with CES-D in the sample are small. Given the balance of evidence (particularly the strong protective self-report markers and healthful behaviors), it is most likely that this participant’s CES-D score falls in the lower half of the study distribution.

42137,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report symptom and trait profile:
The participant’s self-report profile is mixed with respect to depressive symptom risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42) is slightly above the study mean (Z = 0.07) and the STAI scale shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), indicating that anxiety-proneness is a relevant risk factor for concurrent depressive symptoms in this sample. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92), a modest positive correlate of CES-D (r = 0.28), and current self-rated happiness is below average (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53; correlated r = -0.46 with CES-D), both of which point toward greater affective distress. Conversely, self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 37, Z = -0.17) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), suggesting a substantial protective influence against elevated depressive symptom burden. Other psychosocial indicators that tend to buffer mood—interpersonal trust (Z = 0.83) and health satisfaction (Z = 0.30)—also trend in a protective direction (both negatively correlated with CES-D).

Paragraph 2 — Sleep (subjective and wearable) and daily timing:
Subjective sleep quality is poorer than optimal (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep; Z = 0.59), which commonly co-occurs with depressive symptoms. Objective sleep from the wearable shows median nightly duration near sample average (~7 h 18 min, Z = 0.14) and modest night-to-night variability (SD ~90 minutes, Z = -0.25). Sleep timing is moderately late (median start ~00:31) with some variability (start-time SD ~78 minutes, Z = -0.10). The pattern—adequate objective duration but worse subjective sleep—can reflect sleep dissatisfaction or fragmented sleep experience, a feature that often accompanies mood symptoms even when gross duration appears normal.

Paragraph 3 — Circadian and cardiac physiology:
Cardiac circadian summary metrics indicate moderate regularity but somewhat reduced amplitude. MESOR is low relative to the sample (62.6, Z = -1.55) and amplitude is below average (Z = -0.72), while interdaily stability and intradaily variability are slightly elevated (Z = 0.33 and 0.60, respectively), suggesting acceptable day-to-day rhythm consistency with some within-day fragmentation. Resting heart rate is low (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low sympathetic tone; in this sample RHR correlates modestly with CES-D (r = 0.19), but the participant’s low RHR points away from physiological arousal typically observed with higher depressive symptom burden. Hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced daytime peaks (notably mid- to late-afternoon) but these peaks have small-to-moderate correlations with CES-D (mostly near zero or small negative), indicating that time-of-day cardiac activation patterns here do not strongly map onto depressive symptom levels.

Paragraph 4 — Activity, lifestyle, and behavioral context:
Behavioral indicators are generally mixed-to-protective. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more; Z = 1.07), low recreational substance use, and limited napping (mean daily naps ~0.07, Z ≈ 0). Sedentary hobby time is elevated (Z = 1.41), but socialization time is below sample mean (Z = -0.62); both variables have only small correlations with CES-D in this dataset. Academic performance (GPA) is solid, and overall these lifestyle factors — regular exercise, low substance use, reasonable health satisfaction — are more consistent with lower-to-moderate depressive symptom burden than with markedly elevated burden.

Paragraph 5 — Holistic synthesis and likelihood of CES-D group:
Weighing convergent evidence, the profile contains risk-relevant signals (elevated perceived stress, reduced happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, trait anxiety linked to CES-D) but also several notable protective factors with strong associations to lower CES-D (notably high self-esteem, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, good health satisfaction, and high interpersonal trust). Many physiological circadian indicators do not show the degree of dysregulation typically associated with high depressive symptomatology, and objective sleep duration is near the sample norm. Given the combination of protective features that have relatively strong inverse associations with CES-D (particularly self-esteem) and the absence of extreme elevations on several robust risk markers, the balance of evidence suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms (i.e., not among the highest 50% of CES-D scores).

48013,19.0,0.7616580310880829,"Self-report measures indicate multiple proximal psychological risk factors for elevated depressive symptoms. The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z = +1.35), low self‑esteem (RSES = 28; Z = -1.43), low current happiness (score = 2; Z = -1.61) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25; Z = +0.92). In this dataset these specific measures have large correlations with CES‑D scores (STAI r = +0.81; Self‑esteem r = -0.71; happiness r = -0.46), which suggests that, taken together, their self‑report profile is strongly associated with higher depressive symptom burden in the study population. Subjective sleep quality is also above the typical cutoff for disturbance (PSQI = 7) and aligns with the pattern of elevated stress and lower positive affect.

Objective wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show late, variable sleep timing and reduced circadian regularity. Median nightly sleep duration is just under 7 hours (6 h 56 m; Z = -0.31) but night‑to‑night variability is high (sleep duration SD = 151 minutes; Z = +1.13) and median sleep onset is late (01:04 AM) with considerable variability (sleep start SD Z = +0.8). Circadian summary metrics indicate low interdaily stability (0.23; Z = -1.48) and reduced amplitude (7.44; Z = -1.08), with low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = -1.54) — a profile consistent with irregular, lower‑amplitude heart‑rate rhythms. Several sleep‑timing and variability features have modest positive correlations with CES‑D in this sample (sleep variability, sleep start variability r ≈ +0.2), supporting the relevance of these objective disturbances to depressive symptomatology.

Physiological activity and daily rhythm features are mixed but compatible with the above pattern. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (59.3 bpm; Z = +0.14) and mesor is slightly elevated (77.5; Z = +0.48). Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir and daytime elevations; notable is an unusually large early‑morning deviation (6–7am value Z = +3.5) indicative of a relatively pronounced morning rise in heart rate on average. Non‑parametric indices (low interdaily stability and modest intradaily variability) together suggest less consistent day‑to‑day structure in physiological arousal, which has been associated in prior work with higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators provide partial protective and partial risk signals. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others ≥ three times/week; Zs ≈ +1.1 to +1.2), some social time with friends (1–2 hours daily), and low substance/drug use — features typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. However, high internet and music use and limited engagement in reading or other hobbies, plus low interpersonal trust, moderate alcohol frequency, and subjective health concerns, temper the protective influence of exercise. The combination of active exercise but persistent high anxiety/low self‑esteem and irregular sleep suggests that behavioral activation alone may be insufficient to offset mood‑related risk factors.

Integrated impression and likely CES‑D placement: convergent evidence from strong self‑report correlates (high trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, low happiness), disturbed subjective sleep, and objective circadian irregularity points toward a greater depressive symptom burden relative to the cohort. Although some lifestyle factors (regular exercise, modest social time) could mitigate risk, the magnitude and direction of the measures most strongly correlated with CES‑D in this sample (particularly STAI and self‑esteem) favor an elevated CES‑D score. On balance, the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for CES‑D.

The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 20, Z = -2.11) is markedly low relative to the study sample, and self-reported happiness is relatively high (Current Happy = 5.0, Z = 1.64). Self-esteem is elevated (RSES reported value with Z = 1.1) and perceived stress is low (PSS = 12, Z = -2.62). These scales have sizable correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., STAI r = 0.81, SelfEsteem r = -0.71), such that the participant’s low anxiety and high self-esteem would be expected to correspond to lower depressive symptomatology. One notable interpersonal risk indicator is relatively low interpersonal trust (Z = -2.39), which in the sample correlates modestly with CES-D (r = -0.42); this isolated signal suggests some social-cognitive caution but is present alongside otherwise protective self-report indicators.

Behavioral habits show a mixed profile: very high sedentary recreational engagement (multiple activities >4 hours/day; video games Z = 4.74, TV/videos Z = 3.17, general sedentary hobby Z = 3.19) and minimal exercise (exercised alone Z = -1.93; team sports Z = -1.09). High screen-based and sedentary time are weakly positively correlated with CES-D in the sample (small positive r values), so these behaviors represent modest risk factors. In contrast, the participant reports substantial time socializing with friends (Z = 2.53), which would typically be associated with social support and lower depressive symptoms. Substance use is negligible. The low BMI (18.8) is notable but without direct CES-D correlation provided; it may reflect constitution or lifestyle rather than an affective signal on its own.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics are consistent with regular, consolidated rest and do not suggest disturbed sleep architecture. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 14 min (Z = 0.06) with low night-to-night variability (SD = 35 min, Z = -1.48), and the PSQI indicates subjectively good sleep (score = 3, Z = -1.72). Sleep start time is relatively late (median ~01:04 AM) but only moderately variable (SD ~54 min). Circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate show a strongly regular and stable 24-hour pattern: high interdaily stability (0.70, Z = 2.4), low intradaily variability (0.22, Z = -2.29), and elevated autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 2.24), indicating consistent day-to-day timing and low fragmentation. Mesor and amplitude of heart rate are somewhat elevated (Mesor HR Z = 1.35; Amplitude Z = 1.72) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (4:51 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal heart rate suppression and daytime elevations. Overall, wearable physiology points to a robust, regular circadian organization with no wearable-derived markers strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology.

Synthesizing modalities, the strongest evidence favors a relatively low CES-D burden. The most weighty correlates in the study (trait anxiety and self-esteem) are in protective directions for this participant, and sleep quality and circadian regularity are both favorable. Risk signals (very high sedentary/screen time, low exercise, low interpersonal trust, late sleep onset) are present but are either weakly related to CES-D in the sample or offset by stronger protective indicators. Given the relative magnitudes (large protective z-scores for anxiety/stress/self-esteem and strong sample correlations linking those measures to CES-D), the balance of evidence indicates the participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

Self-esteem is modestly below the sample mean (RSES = 35; Z = −0.45), and current self-rated happiness is below average (score = 3.0; Z = −0.53). Interpersonal trust and overall health satisfaction are notably below average (trust Z = −1.42; health satisfaction Z = −0.78). The pattern of high anxiety and stress together with reduced self-regard and lower subjective well-being is a cluster of self-report indicators that, in this sample, are correlated with higher CES-D scores (STAI–CESD correlation = +0.82; RSES–CESD correlation = −0.71; Happiness–CESD correlation = −0.46). Taken together, the self-report measures indicate psychological distress and risk factors that are commonly associated with greater depressive symptom burden.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable and subjective sleep data indicate short and late sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 5 h 35 min (Z = −1.99), and median sleep start time is very late (about 02:08 AM). Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7). Variability in sleep duration is relatively high (SD ≈ 122 minutes; Z = +0.49), whereas sleep start times are moderately consistent (SD ≈ 53 minutes; Z = −0.66). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate reflect reduced overall circadian amplitude and regularity: MESOR and amplitude are below the sample mean (MESOR Z = −2.19; Amplitude Z = −0.68), interdaily stability is lower than typical (Z = −0.74) and intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z = +0.39). The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced daytime/evening elevations (notably a large positive deviation at 5–6pm; Z = +1.79) and the expected nocturnal decline. The combination of short, late, and somewhat irregular sleep with blunted circadian amplitude suggests disrupted sleep–wake physiology, which can be associated with higher depressive symptoms; however, correlations between several circadian HR features and CES-D in this dataset are small.

Activity, social behavior, and substance use: The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z = +1.07), moderate social interaction (socializing 1–2 hours; Z ≈ +0.16), and limited recreational substance use (alcohol 1–2 times/month; modest Z-scores). Listening to music and modest screen time are reported as routine. Academic performance data show a downward trend across listed semesters. Exercise frequency is a behavioral factor that typically associates with lower depressive symptoms (exercise–CESD correlations in this dataset are weakly negative), suggesting a partial protective influence. Socializing is present but not extensive; interpersonal trust is low, which may reduce social buffering effects.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Multiple self-report indicators that show relatively large effect sizes in this sample—elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, lowered self-esteem and happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and low interpersonal trust—converge toward greater psychological distress and are strongly or moderately correlated with CES-D in the study (especially STAI and RSES). Wearable-derived evidence of short, late, and somewhat irregular sleep and reduced circadian amplitude is consistent with that self-reported distress, though the direct correlations between many wearable circadian metrics and CES-D are small in this dataset. Protective signals (regular exercise, limited substance use) are present but appear insufficient to outweigh the strength of the self-report risk indicators. Holistically, the balance of evidence indicates a higher-than-median depressive symptom burden relative to the study population.

64232,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"The self-report profile presents a mixture of risk and protective features relevant to depressive symptom burden.

Subjective well-being indicators are lower than average: current happiness is below the sample median (score = 3, Z = -0.53) and sleep quality on the PSQI is in the “disturbed” range (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59). By contrast, global self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), which is a notable protective factor against depressive symptoms. Academic functioning (GPA) and health satisfaction are near typical values for this sample.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures show preserved sleep quantity but elevated irregularity in timing. Median nightly sleep duration is around 8 hours (Z = 1.01), which is favorable in absolute terms, but night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD = 136 minutes, Z = 0.79) and sleep start time (SD = 150 minutes, Z = 1.48) is above the population mean, indicating inconsistent sleep timing. The participant rarely naps. Circadian regularity metrics from heart-rate data show relatively low interdaily stability (0.22, Z = -1.56) and modest intradaily variability (0.48, Z = -0.46), suggesting weaker day-to-day structure in physiological rhythms despite a typical mesor (77.33 bpm, Z = 0.46) and a late-afternoon acrophase (≈ 4:57 PM). Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor also show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations; resting heart rate is in the low-normal range (≈ 59 bpm, Z = 0.15). Sleep timing irregularity and greater sleep variability have small positive correlations with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.2), implying these wearable patterns are modestly associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral habits contain both resilience and risk elements. The participant reports frequent vigorous physical activity (sports three times per week or more; Z = 1.58) and some social engagement (1–2 hours socializing; Z ≈ 0.16), behaviors typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), but recreational drug use is reported at 1–2 times per month and has an extreme relative Z-score (Z ≈ 3.52) in this sample; although the direct correlation between recreational drug use and CES-D here is small (r ≈ 0.16), the high relative frequency is a noteworthy behavioral risk factor to monitor. Overall substance use (no non-prescribed drug use reported) and maintenance of regular exercise are protective considerations.

Integration and interpretation: several indicators point toward elevated depressive symptomatology relative to the study population, while some strong protective factors counterbalance that risk. Markers favoring higher CES-D include elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, reduced self-reported happiness, trait anxiety (which empirically correlates strongly with CES-D), and pronounced irregularity in sleep timing/physiological rhythms. Countervailing markers include high self-esteem (a strong negative correlate of CES-D), regular engagement in sports, adequate average sleep duration, and normative resting heart rate and academic performance. On balance, the combination of elevated stress, disturbed subjective sleep, lower happiness, and irregular circadian structure—together with a modestly elevated trait anxiety—suggests the participant is more likely to fall above the sample median on depressive symptoms than below it. Therefore, given the relative weight of risk indicators versus protective factors in this profile, the participant is most consistent with being in the higher half of the CES-D distribution.

37404,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"The self-report profile indicates multiple protective features against elevated depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety on the STAI is below the study mean (score 35, Z = -0.62) and classified as ""not anxious."" Global self-esteem is essentially average-to-high (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03), a variable that shows a strong inverse correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71). Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21, Z ≈ -0.17) and the participant reports good academic performance (term GPAs ≈ 3.75–3.8) and above-average health satisfaction. Alcohol and drug use are low-to-moderate (no recreational or non-prescribed drug use; modest weekly wine use), and exercise frequency is relatively high (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07). Together these self-report indicators are generally consistent with relatively low-to-average depressive symptom burden.

Subjective sleep reports show some difficulty (PSQI = 7, classified as “disturbed sleep”), but objective sleep from the wearable is largely unremarkable in duration and consistency. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 9 minutes (Z ≈ -0.04) with modest night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 66 minutes, Z ≈ -0.78). Median sleep start time is fairly late (~00:49) but not highly variable (SD ≈ 65 minutes). Napping is essentially absent. Thus objective sleep duration and regularity do not indicate pronounced insomnia or hypersomnia, although the subjective PSQI suggests the participant perceives poorer sleep than the wearable data alone would predict.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features show a pattern of circadian fragmentation and blunted rhythmicity that can be relevant to mood. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z ≈ -1.54), indicating weaker day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is elevated (0.74, Z = 1.37), and amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (Z ≈ -1.54), consistent with a lower-amplitude, more fragmented circadian profile. Resting heart rate (60.8 bpm, Z = 0.32) and the hourly aggregated deviations are largely physiologically plausible (nighttime HR reductions and daytime/evening increases) without clear signs of nocturnal hyperarousal; correlations between these heart-rate features and CES-D in the sample are small to modest. In sum, the wearable physiology suggests circadian rhythm attenuation and fragmentation—features that are associated in the literature with depressive symptoms—but in this case their sample correlations are modest and other objective health markers are not markedly abnormal.

Integrative interpretation and weighting of evidence: protective, strongly correlated indicators (high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, regular exercise, low substance use, good academic functioning, and normal objective sleep duration) outweigh the more limited signals of elevated risk (subjective sleep complaints, somewhat lower self-reported happiness and trust, and objective circadian fragmentation). The circadian irregularity is a notable observation and could represent a vulnerability or a subclinical correlate, but its associations with CES-D are modest in this dataset and it occurs alongside several robust protective factors. Taken holistically, the pattern of measures is more consistent with low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden (i.e., at or below the median of the study sample) rather than with markedly elevated CES-D scores.

The participant reports a relatively high trait anxiety score (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76), and this measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the dataset (r = 0.81), making it one of the most diagnostically informative self-report signals available. Self-esteem is lower than the study mean (RSES = 34; Z = -0.59), and self-esteem is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), such that lower self-esteem here is a robust indicator of greater depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25; Z = 0.92) and correlates positively with CES-D (r = 0.28), and the PSQI score (6) meets the threshold commonly used to indicate disturbed sleep. Taken together, these self-reported psychological variables—high anxiety, lower self-worth, and elevated stress—provide convergent evidence favoring a higher CES-D score relative to the study population.

Behavioral self-reports provide mixed information but do not strongly contradict the above risk profile. The participant reports limited regular exercise and little sports participation (exercise frequencies low; Z-scores negative), which is weakly associated with higher CES-D in the sample. Alcohol use is modest (beer 1–2×/week; Z = 1.01) while recreational and non-prescribed drug use is negligible; substance-use correlations with CES-D are small in this dataset. Social activity and time spent with friends are relatively high (socializing 2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), and academic performance (GPA across terms ≈ 3.4) is solid; these factors are often protective or neutral regarding mood symptoms and provide some counterbalance to risk indicated by affective measures. Self-reported current happiness is slightly above average (score = 4; Z = 0.55), which also partially offsets risk but has only a moderate inverse correlation with CES-D (r = -0.46).

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data add important objective detail that tends to align with elevated depressive symptom risk. Median nightly sleep duration is close to normative for the sample (7 h 5 m; Z = -0.13), but night-to-night sleep variability is very large (sleep duration SD = 222 minutes; Z = 2.75) and sleep onset timing is substantially delayed on average (median sleep start ≈ 03:03 AM) with high variability (start time SD Z = 1.21). Irregular and delayed sleep timing and high variability show small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (e.g., sleep variability r ≈ 0.2), so the participant’s objectively measured circadian irregularity and late habitual sleep onset constitute meaningful behavioral risk markers. Heart-rate circadian summary metrics show a modestly reduced MESOR and amplitude (MESOR Z = -0.6; amplitude Z = -0.44) and otherwise typical interdaily stability and intradaily variability; reduced amplitude/blunting of rhythm has a small negative correlation with CES-D in this sample (amplitude r = -0.10). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.6 bpm; Z = -0.54), which is plausibly linked to fitness and not strongly indicative of depressive symptoms here (resting HR correlation with CES-D is small, r = 0.19).

Weighing the evidence across modalities, the strongest and most predictive signals in this participant’s data are the elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and reduced self-esteem, both of which have large correlations with CES-D in the study and therefore carry substantial inferential weight. Objective sleep findings—particularly very late average sleep timing and high night-to-night variability—provide additional support for elevated symptom burden, while perceived stress and disturbed subjective sleep further corroborate that pattern. Countervailing indicators (moderate self-reported happiness, high social time, solid GPA, low resting heart rate) attenuate but do not negate the convergent risk signal. On balance—the high-anxiety/low-self-esteem profile combined with sleep irregularity and elevated perceived stress—makes it more likely that this participant’s CES-D score falls in the upper half of the study distribution.

Health satisfaction is elevated (Z = 1.3), substance use is absent, and academic performance is strong. These survey indicators—particularly low anxiety, high self-esteem, and high happiness—are robustly associated with lower depressive symptom burden in the study correlations and point toward relatively low CES-D symptomatology.

Wearable cardiovascular data show a modestly elevated central tendency (MESOR 82.9 bpm, Z = 1.22) and resting heart rate that is somewhat above the sample mean (66.7 bpm, Z = 1.02). Hourly heart-rate deviations follow an expected pattern of lower values overnight and rising into the evening, with the largest positive deviations in the early evening (6–9 pm) consistent with evening activity/physiological arousal. While resting heart rate and MESOR have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.2), the magnitude of these physiological elevations is moderate and is not accompanied by other physiological markers of circadian disruption; thus their contribution to depressive symptom likelihood appears limited relative to the stronger protective psychosocial indicators.

Weighing all modalities holistically: strong protective signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep, low substance use, stable circadian rhythms, and good academic/health functioning) outweigh the modest risk signal from an above-average resting heart rate and a late but stable sleep onset. Multiple measures that correlate strongly with CES-D in this dataset point toward lower rather than elevated depressive symptoms for this participant.

Academic functioning (GPA) and health satisfaction are high (health satisfaction Z = 1.47), consistent with preserved functioning and subjective well-being.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a well-structured, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (0.64, Z = 1.9) and 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z = 2.07), while intradaily variability is modestly reduced (Z = -0.53). These features indicate a consistent daily organization of cardiovascular activity across the recording period. Resting heart rate is relatively low-normal (56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22), mesor and amplitude are near the sample mean (mesor Z = -0.21; amplitude Z = 0.59), and the cosinor acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (≈4:20 PM). Aggregated hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, with somewhat higher-than-average evening deviations (6–9 PM). In the sample, circadian regularity features have minimal or mixed correlations with CES-D (correlations near zero to small negative), so these regular physiological rhythms provide limited evidence for elevated depressive symptoms; if anything, high regularity is more consistent with lower symptom burden.

Sleep: Objective sleep metrics show a median nightly duration of ~6 h 46 min (Z = -0.51), a late median sleep start time (~01:29 AM), and a sleep duration SD around 98 minutes. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) crosses the common cutoff for disturbed sleep, suggesting some reported sleep difficulties despite otherwise regular circadian metrics. Correlations between sleep duration and CES-D in this dataset are minimal, though sleep timing variability and nap frequency show small positive correlations with CES-D (SD of sleep start time r ≈ +0.22; mean daily naps r ≈ +0.21). Overall, objective sleep is somewhat shortened and shifted late, and subjective sleep reports indicate mild disturbance; these provide a modest signal toward elevated symptoms but are not strong in magnitude relative to the protective indicators above.

Integrated appraisal and CES-D ranking: Balancing the multi-modal evidence, the most informative and strongly weighted signals point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. The strongest statistical relationships in the dataset (e.g., STAI–CESD r ≈ +0.81 and SelfEsteem–CESD r ≈ -0.71) are represented here by a low STAI score and high self-esteem, both of which favor lower CES-D. Additional supportive observations include high reported happiness, low perceived stress, high health satisfaction, regular circadian physiology, and preserved academic performance. Some weaker risk indicators are present (slightly disturbed subjective sleep, late bedtimes, low socializing and low exercise), but their correlations with CES-D in the sample are small and they do not outweigh the protective profile. On balance, the evidence indicates this participant’s overall CES-D score is more consistent with the bottom half of the study distribution.

83612,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"The self-report profile indicates a pattern of psychological vulnerability that is commonly associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 58, z = 1.65) and, in this dataset, has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.82), marking it as a substantial indicator of concurrent depressive symptom risk. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, z = -1.29) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which further aligns with higher symptom load. Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23, z = 0.38) and interpersonal trust is lower than average (z = -1.1), both of which have small-to-moderate correlations with CES-D in the sample. Momentary self-rated happiness is above average (current = 4.0, z = 0.55), which presents a partial counterbalance, but the magnitude and strength of the trait-level risk markers (high anxiety, low self-esteem, low trust) weigh more heavily as predictors of elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology present a mixed picture. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5) is at the study’s “good sleep” threshold and in the lower (better) range relative to peers (z = -0.8), but objective sleep is slightly short on average (median nightly sleep = 6 h 42 min, z = -0.59) with modest night-to-night variability (sleep SD = 67 minutes, z = -0.76). Circadian-regularity metrics derived from heart rate indicate reduced stability and greater fragmentation (interdaily stability z = -1.07; intradaily variability z = 1.09; autocorrelation at 24h z = -1.29), suggesting less consistent daily rhythm organization despite a normal-looking acrophase (~4:23 PM) and a lower-than-average mesor and resting heart rate. These wearable features (irregular rhythms, somewhat shortened sleep) are consistent with factors that can contribute to or exacerbate depressive symptoms, though the sample correlations provided for these specific wearable measures and CES-D are small in magnitude.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators contain both risk and protective elements. The participant reports low-to-moderate social and recreational engagement (socializing z = -0.62; sedentary hobby z = 0.82) and low frequency of team sports, which may reduce a source of social buffering. Exercise frequency is modest (exercising alone and with others 1–2 times per week) and substance use is minimal; both patterns are modestly protective relative to higher-risk profiles. Academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high 3.7–3.82 range), which can reflect preserved functioning and serve as a resilience marker. Taken together, lifestyle data show some behavioral risk (reduced socializing, irregular daily structure) alongside protective aspects (low substance use, moderate exercise, high academic functioning).

Integrative interpretation and CES-D placement: the strongest and most predictive signals in the multimodal profile are elevated trait anxiety and low self-esteem—both of which correlate strongly with CES-D in this dataset—along with reduced interpersonal trust and circadian irregularity. These put the participant at greater likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms compared with the average study participant. Countervailing signals (subjective sleep rated as relatively good, moderate happiness, low substance use, and high academic performance) moderate but do not negate the stronger trait-level risk indicators. Considering the relative magnitudes (notably the high STAI z-score and large correlations of STAI and self-esteem with CES-D), the overall evidence is more consistent with this participant’s CES-D score falling in the upper half of the study distribution.

The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 24; Z = -1.71, classified “not anxious”), elevated self-esteem (SelfEsteem Z = 1.38), above-average momentary happiness (Current Happy Z = 1.64), and high satisfaction with physical health (Health Satisfaction Z = 1.22). Social and behavioral indices further align with adaptive functioning: frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more; Exercise Z = 1.07), regular socializing with friends (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), low recreational drug use, and modest alcohol consumption. Several of these self-report features have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., STAI correlation with CES-D = 0.81; SelfEsteem correlation = -0.71), and the direction and magnitude of this participant’s scores (low anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated happiness and social activity) point toward lower depressive symptom burden relative to the study population.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics are consistent with organized daily rhythms and relatively high cardiovascular fitness. Cosinor parameters show a typical diurnal rhythm (Mesor ~71 bpm, Amplitude ~11 bpm, acrophase ~4:17 PM) with interdaily stability (0.40) and intradaily variability (0.52) near the cohort mean (Z-scores -0.08 and -0.18 respectively), indicating neither pronounced fragmentation nor extreme rigidity of the heart-rate rhythm. Resting heart rate is low (49 bpm, Z = -1.08), which together with frequent exercise suggests good cardiovascular conditioning; lower resting heart rate in this dataset is not strongly associated with higher CES-D (correlation ~0.19) and in this case likely reflects fitness rather than physiologic arousal linked to mood disturbance.

Nighttime physiology and sleep metrics show some mild risk-relevant features but not large deviations. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration is about 6 hours 17 minutes (Z = -1.11), indicating shorter-than-average sleep on this scale, and the self-report PSQI is 6 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”), a score slightly above common clinical cutoffs for sleep disturbance. Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ~00:48) and somewhat variable (sleep start SD ~113 minutes, Z = 0.66), and sleep duration variability is moderately elevated (SD ~120 minutes, Z = 0.43). These sleep characteristics (short average duration and higher variability) have modest positive correlations with CES-D in the cohort (sleep SD correlation ~0.2), suggesting they could contribute some upward pressure on depressive symptom scores; however, the absolute magnitudes here are moderate rather than extreme.

Integrated appraisal weighing multimodal signals favors a lower relative depressive symptom burden. Multiple strong indicators associated with lower CES-D—very low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated self-reported happiness, regular exercise, robust social contact, low substance use, and physiologic markers of fitness—outweigh the modestly elevated indicators that are sometimes linked to higher depressive symptoms (borderline PSQI score, short and somewhat variable sleep). Circadian structure and hour-by-hour heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime peaks and do not indicate marked dysregulation. Considering the relative effect sizes (e.g., very low STAI with a strong positive correlation to CES-D and high SelfEsteem with a strong negative correlation), the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s CES-D score would fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

Trait anxiety is high (STAI = 51, z = +0.96) and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = +0.82), signaling a robust link to higher depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 28, z = −1.43), and self-esteem is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = −0.71), which further supports greater symptom likelihood. Sleep-related self-report via the PSQI is above common clinical cutoffs (PSQI = 8, z = +0.59, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), consistent with subjective sleep difficulties that are often associated with higher CES-D scores. Behavioral items show minimal social and physical activity (no reported exercise, socializing z ≈ −0.62, exercise z-scores strongly negative), and relatively higher sedentary/media use (TV/internet z ≈ +0.85–+1.28); these lifestyle patterns are modestly associated in the sample with higher depressive symptoms. Other survey indices are mixed: perceived stress is near sample mean (PSS = 21, z ≈ −0.17), current happiness is slightly above average (happiness z = +0.55) and inversely associated with CES-D (r ≈ −0.46), and health satisfaction is below average (z ≈ −0.95). Taken together, the strongest self-report signals that predict greater CES-D scores are the high trait anxiety and low self-esteem, with subjective sleep disturbance and low social/physical activity providing additional supporting evidence.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep metrics show a consistent but delayed circadian pattern with night-time physiological activation and shortened sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 h 32 m (z ≈ −0.81), with a very late median sleep start time (≈ 02:45), and a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep — objectively short, late sleep that is relatively regular (sleep start SD ≈ 54 minutes, sleep duration SD ≈ 56 minutes, both with z ≈ −0.6 to −1.0). Circadian analysis from heart rate shows high interdaily stability (value 0.62, z = +1.74) and a pronounced amplitude (z = +1.16) with an acrophase around 7:04 PM. Hourly deviations from mesor reveal marked evening and late-night heart rate elevation (notably 9–10 pm and 11 pm–12 am with z > +2), and deep early-morning troughs (large negative deviations around 4–6 am). Resting heart rate is low-to-average (57.2 bpm, z ≈ −0.11). Psychophysiologically, this pattern is most consistent with a late-timed daily routine and evening physiological arousal: a robust, regular circadian rhythm that is shifted later and associated with short, late sleep. Within this dataset, circadian regularity measures (interdaily stability, amplitude) show weak or small correlations with CES-D, but the combination of late timing, shortened sleep, and nocturnal arousal is concordant with sleep-related pathways to elevated depressive symptomatology.

Integrative assessment weighing magnitudes and correlations: the largest and most predictive signals pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms are the high trait anxiety (strong positive CES-D correlate, r ≈ 0.82) and low self-esteem (strong inverse correlate, r ≈ −0.71). Subjective sleep disturbance, objectively short and late sleep timing, low social contact and little exercise provide convergent support, albeit with smaller sample correlations. Countervailing or neutral signals include relatively high interdaily stability (regular daily structure), a low resting heart rate, and only average perceived stress; current happiness is slightly above average, which may temper—but does not outweigh—the stronger risk signals. On balance, the pattern of strong anxiety/self-esteem indicators together with disturbed sleep timing and low social/physical activity favors placement toward the higher half of CES-D scores in this study population.

79341,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"Self-report profile: The participant reports several strengths that are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is very high (Rosenberg score 39/40; Z = 0.11) and this measure has a strong negative correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = -0.71), suggesting that this participant’s high self-regard would be expected to relate to relatively lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is low (PSS = 15; Z = -1.8), and sleep quality on the PSQI is at the conventional cutoff for “good” (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8), both of which are also consistent with lower symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 41) is near the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.03); although STAI correlates strongly with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.81), the participant’s STAI score is not markedly elevated and therefore not a strong indicator of high depressive symptomatology here. One concerning self-report finding is low momentary happiness (self-rated “Happy” = 2.0; Z = -1.61), which is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46) and indicates reduced positive affect relative to peers, a feature that can accompany higher depressive symptoms even when other protective factors are present.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use reported; Z-scores all negative) and regular physical activity (exercises alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07; sports 1–2×/week, Z = 0.91). These behaviors are generally protective against depressive symptoms. Social activity is moderate (socializing 1–2 hours; Z = 0.16). Screen-based recreational time includes elevated video game time (Z = 1.71) but relatively typical or below-average internet usage; correlations between these leisure habits and CES-D are small in this sample. Overall, lifestyle indicators (exercise frequency, low substance use, reasonable social contact) point away from a high CES-D score.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure: Wearable heart-rate based circadian metrics indicate relatively strong and regular rhythms. Interdaily stability (0.52; Z = 0.91) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.44; Z = 0.98) are above average, suggesting consistent daily structure across the recording period. Intradaily variability (0.59; Z = 0.32) is near average, and amplitude is near the sample mean (amplitude Z = -0.19). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a robust day–night contrast (large negative deviations overnight, peak positive deviations around midday), consistent with preserved circadian modulation of physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is low (48.25 bpm; Z = -1.18), consistent with higher fitness. These objective features—regular circadian patterning and low resting HR—are generally associated with better mood regulation and lower depressive symptom burden in population studies.

Sleep quantity and timing: Median nightly sleep duration is modestly below the sample mean (6 h 46 min; Z = -0.51) and sleep start times are late on average (median start ≈ 01:50), with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 68 minutes; Z = -0.32). Although the participant goes to bed late, subjective sleep quality is at the PSQI cutoff for “good,” and naps are not reported (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Slightly short sleep duration and late bedtimes can be risk factors for low positive affect or mood symptoms, and they may relate to the low self-reported happiness score; however, the overall sleep profile does not show major fragmentation or disorder signals in the wearable-derived rhythm measures.

Integrated interpretation and likely CES-D placement: Weighing the multimodal evidence, the participant shows several notable protective factors against elevated depressive symptoms: very high self-esteem (strong negative predictor of CES-D in this sample), low perceived stress, frequent exercise, minimal substance use, strong and regular circadian physiology, and low resting heart rate. Contrasting signals include low self-rated current happiness and somewhat late sleep timing with slightly reduced sleep duration. Trait anxiety is near average rather than elevated. Given the particularly strong association between self-esteem and CES-D in this dataset (r = -0.71) and the participant’s very high self-esteem combined with multiple objective protective markers, the balance of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the CES-D distribution (i.e., relatively low or average depressive symptom burden rather than elevated). Therefore, the participant is more consistent with the bottom 50% of the study population on the CES-D.

83536,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Self-report psychological measures indicate a profile more consistent with low or normative depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 26, z = -1.51) is well below the sample mean, and current happiness is relatively high (self-rated 5.0, z = 1.64). Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES z ≈ 0.4) and shows a strong inverse correlation with CES-D in the study (r ≈ -0.71), supporting the interpretation that this participant’s self-concept is protective against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is not elevated (PSS = 21, z ≈ -0.17) and the participant reports high health satisfaction (z = 1.3), both of which are associated with lower CES-D in the sample. Taken together, the subjective psychological data point toward relatively low depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are largely consistent with adaptive functioning. Academic performance is strong (GPA values in the mid-to-high 3's) and substance use is minimal. Social interaction time (2–3 hours socializing; z = 0.95) and modest physical activity with others (exercise with others 1–2×/week; z = 0.53) provide social and behavioral engagement that typically attenuate depressive symptoms (exercise-with-others shows a negative correlation with CES-D in the sample). One notable behavioral outlier is extensive time listening to music (>4 hours/day, z = 2.06), which in this dataset has a small positive correlation with CES-D; this could reflect a compensatory or affect-regulation behavior but on its own does not outweigh the broader pattern of social and occupational functioning.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology present a mixed picture but do not strongly indicate high depressive burden. Median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is approximately 7 hours 5 minutes (z ≈ -0.13), which is near the sample average, although the participant’s PSQI score (6) meets a common threshold for disturbed subjective sleep. Sleep timing, however, is markedly late (median sleep start around 02:25 AM) and moderately variable (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes, z ≈ 0.35). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show modest interdaily stability (0.41 near the sample mean) and somewhat elevated intradaily variability (0.65, z = 0.74), suggesting greater day-to-day fragmentation of activity/physiology and more frequent transitions between rest and activity within days. Resting heart rate is low (56.4 bpm, z ≈ -0.21) and hourly heart-rate deviations display a clear day–night amplitude with expected nocturnal troughs and afternoon/evening peaks; these indicate preserved diurnal modulation of cardiovascular activity. Overall, objective sleep quantity and circadian rhythmicity are largely intact, but late and somewhat irregular sleep timing plus increased intradaily variability could represent risk factors that warrant monitoring.

Physiological and behavioral signals converge with survey measures to suggest relatively low depressive symptoms rather than elevated symptoms. Protective signs include low trait anxiety, elevated happiness and self-esteem, minimal substance use, good academic functioning, and normal-to-favorable resting physiological indices. Risk signals—subjective disturbed sleep (PSQI >5), late and variable bedtimes, elevated intradaily variability, and high self-reported music-listening—are present but modest in magnitude and partially contextually explicable (e.g., student schedule, evening activity). Correlational evidence provided in the dataset also aligns with the protective indicators: several variables that are favorable for this participant (self-esteem, health satisfaction, social/exercise engagement) are negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample.

Synthesis and CES-D ranking: weighting the multiple modalities—self-report affect, trait measures, behavioral engagement, objective sleep duration, and circadian physiology—yields a profile more consistent with lower-to-average depressive symptom burden within the study population. The balance of evidence (low trait anxiety, high happiness, higher self-esteem, strong academic functioning, limited substance use, physiologically normal resting heart rate and adequate sleep duration) argues against placement in the upper half of the CES-D distribution. Although there are some modest risk indicators (PSQI = 6, late/irregular sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability), these do not outweigh the preponderance of protective factors. Therefore the participant is most consistent with the bottom half of the CES-D distribution.

67608,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"Self-report and trait-level indicators point toward low-to-moderate depressive symptom risk. The participant reports high self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ +0.96) and relatively high current happiness (Z ≈ +1.64), and endorses low trait anxiety on the STAI (score 26; Z ≈ -1.51). Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS score 21; Z ≈ -0.17). Academic performance and health satisfaction are high, and reported exercise frequency (especially exercising alone three times/week or more) is above average. These measures are strongly weighted in typical depression models: the large negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D in this sample (-0.71) and the strong positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D (0.81) both favor a lower CES-D estimate here (high self-esteem, low anxiety). Note a minor data inconsistency: the reported self-esteem raw score (45) exceeds the conventional RSES range (10–40), but the provided z-score and correlations indicate relatively elevated perceived self-worth.

Behavioral routines and social engagement show mixed signals. The participant reports very limited socializing and few sedentary or recreational hobbies (socializing Z ≈ -2.2; multiple leisure activities at or below sample averages). Reduced social time can be a risk correlate for elevated depressive symptoms, but in this case other social/affective indicators (high happiness, high self-esteem) do not mirror social-withdrawal–related distress. Alcohol use is modestly above average (1–2 times/week), recreational drug use is absent, and exercise/sports participation is relatively frequent—these activity patterns are more consistent with lower depressive symptomatology.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology are generally consistent with adequate sleep duration but show some features worth noting. Fitbit-derived median nocturnal sleep duration is about 7 h 12 min (Z ≈ 0.02), with low night-to-night variability in both sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 26 minutes; Z ≈ -1.24) and duration (SD ≈ 58 minutes; Z ≈ -0.98), indicating a relatively regular sleep schedule. However, the self-reported PSQI score = 7 (classification: disturbed sleep) suggests the participant perceives sleep quality problems despite normal duration and regularity. Mean daily naps are rare. Taken together, subjective sleep disturbance with objectively adequate and regular sleep raises the possibility of perceived sleep-related difficulties without large behavioral disruption—this pattern can be present in people with subclinical sleep complaints but does not strongly indicate high depressive burden on its own.

Heart-rate–based circadian features show a generally regular rhythm with some within-day fragmentation. Nonparametric circadian summary: interdaily stability is moderately above average (Z ≈ +0.58) while intradaily variability is elevated (Z ≈ +1.58), indicating a fairly regular daily rhythm across days but more fragmentation of activity/physiological state within days. Mesor and resting heart rate are lower than sample mean (mesor Z ≈ -0.78; resting HR Z ≈ -0.54), consistent with a relatively low tonic cardiovascular level. Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected overnight trough and daytime elevations; one notable feature is an unusually large evening heart-rate deviation around 8–9 pm (Z ≈ +2.32), which could reflect evening physiological arousal or activity in some evenings. Correlations between these circadian/HR metrics and CES-D in this sample are small and inconsistent, so the wearable physiology overall provides only weak, non-directional information about depressive symptoms for this participant.

Integration and conclusion: weighing the strongest, most predictive indicators (very low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem and happiness, regular sleep duration, frequent exercise, high academic performance and health satisfaction) against the weaker risk signals (self-reported PSQI >5, very low socializing, elevated intradaily variability in physiological data), the preponderance of evidence favors relatively low depressive symptom burden. Several variables with high sample-level correlations to CES-D (trait anxiety positively; self-esteem negatively) are aligned with low risk in this participant. Although there are some isolated risk features (perceived sleep disturbance, minimal social time), they are not supported by a broader pattern of affective or physiological dysregulation. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the CES-D distribution in this study population.

19735,34.0,0.9559585492227979,"Summary of self-report psychological profile:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) and reduced global self-esteem (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01). These two measures have the largest correlations with CES-D in the provided data (STAI r ≈ 0.82; Self‑Esteem r ≈ -0.71), which makes them particularly informative for estimating depressive symptom burden. Current self-reported happiness is below the study mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53; correlation with CES-D r ≈ -0.46), and interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are also lower than average (trust Z = -1.1; health satisfaction Z = -0.45), each of which are modestly associated with depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is lower than the sample mean (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71), but its correlation with CES-D in this dataset is smaller than for anxiety or self‑esteem. Taken together, the self-report profile emphasizes anxious affect and low self-regard—two features that, given their strong statistical relationships to CES‑D in this sample, point toward higher depressive symptom levels.

Behavioral and social context:
Daily activity and social engagement metrics show limited social interaction and recreational engagement: very little time spent socializing (≈15 min/day or less, Z = -2.2) and no reported team sports or exercising with others (Z = -1.58 for exercising with others; sports Z = -1.09). The participant does exercise alone at low-to-moderate frequency (1–2×/week). Substance use is present at modest levels (beer and liquor 1–2×/week; recreational drugs 1–2×/month), with only small correlations to CES‑D in the dataset. Academic performance (GPA) is high. The behavioral pattern suggests limited social contact and relatively solitary leisure, which are behavioral contexts often associated with higher depressive symptoms even when other functioning (e.g., GPA, some physical fitness indices) appears preserved.

Sleep timing, sleep quality, and circadian physiology:
Objective and subjective sleep measures present a mixed picture. Median nightly sleep duration from wearables is adequate and above the sample mean (~7 h 48 min, Z = 0.77), but the PSQI score (6) crosses a common threshold for disturbed sleep. Sleep timing is late: median sleep start near 02:01 AM with moderate variability (start-time SD ≈ 77 minutes). Late sleep timing and some subjective sleep disturbance are relevant because circadian timing and sleep complaints are linked to mood. Circadian features derived from heart rate show a relatively large amplitude (amplitude Z = 1.13) and a low resting heart rate (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93); interdaily stability (regularity) is near the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.09) and intradaily fragmentation is slightly lower than average (Z ≈ -0.25). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show typical nocturnal declines and daytime elevations with a principal acrophase in the late afternoon (≈5:26 PM). Overall, physiology is consistent with a person who gets sufficient total sleep but has delayed timing and some subjective sleep disturbance; the circadian heart-rate rhythm is pronounced and reasonably regular.

Synthesis with respect to depressive symptoms (CES‑D):
The strongest empirical signals pointing toward elevated CES‑D scores are the high trait anxiety (STAI) and low self‑esteem, both of which show large correlations with CES‑D in the study sample and are clearly outside favorable ranges for this participant. Complementary signals—reduced self-reported happiness, low interpersonal social time, and PSQI-defined sleep disturbance—further support increased depressive symptom burden. Wearable-derived metrics provide a mixed contribution: adequate total sleep duration and a low resting heart rate are relatively protective or neutral, but late sleep timing and subjective sleep complaints are consistent with mood vulnerability. Several other behavioral indicators (high GPA, modest perceived stress relative to the sample mean) run counter to a severe functional impairment picture, but they do not outweigh the strong psychosocial indicators associated with elevated CES‑D in this dataset.

Conclusion regarding CES‑D distribution placement:
Given the combination of strongly predictive self-report features (especially elevated trait anxiety and reduced self‑esteem), plus supporting behavioral signs (low social engagement, low reported happiness, PSQI > 5) and circadian features indicating delayed timing, the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant’s CES‑D score is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study population distribution.

The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z ≈ -0.4) is below the study mean, and self-esteem is relatively elevated (RSES Z ≈ +0.7), both measures that correlate strongly with CES-D in expected directions (higher anxiety and lower self-esteem are associated with higher CES-D). Perceived stress is near the sample average (PSS Z ≈ -0.17) and current happiness is somewhat below average (happy Z ≈ -0.53), but global health satisfaction is notably high (Z ≈ +1.3). The pattern of low-to-average anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, and high health satisfaction provides multiple self-report signals that favor lower depressive symptomatology rather than elevation.

Sleep measures show a mixed pattern with potential relevance for mood. The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score 8), yet objective Fitbit data show a long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 13 min, Z ≈ +1.3). At the same time, night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD ≈ 169 minutes, Z ≈ +1.6) and the median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:35) with substantial variability (start-time SD Z ≈ +1.3). This discordance—subjectively poor sleep despite long average duration, combined with late and inconsistent timing—can be behaviorally relevant for affect regulation and is a modest risk signal for depressive symptoms. However, the absence of daytime napping and the long average sleep duration suggest preserved opportunity for recovery on many nights.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics point toward a relatively well-structured circadian profile and normal autonomic baseline. Heart rate cosinor features show a clear rhythm (amplitude Z ≈ +1.05, mesor and resting HR near-sample-average), high interdaily stability (Z ≈ +1.24), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -2.08), and a typical daytime acrophase (~5:58 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal nadir and daytime elevations. These indicators—robust 24-hour organization and low fragmentation—are generally associated with healthier mood regulation and lower depressive symptom burden in population studies, and they provide an objective counterbalance to the subjective report of disturbed sleep.

Lifestyle and behavioral context provide additional protective signals with some caveats. The participant exercises frequently (exercised alone 3+ times/week, Z ≈ +1.1), uses alcohol at moderate levels, reports little or no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and spends moderate time socializing. There are higher-than-average leisure screen behaviors (video games Z ≈ +2.5, internet use Z ≈ +0.85) which may contribute to late-night schedules and lower positive affect in some contexts, but these behaviors alone do not provide strong evidence of elevated depressive symptomatology given the broader pattern of active lifestyle and social engagement.

Integrated assessment and ranking relative to the study sample: Evidence consistent with lower CES-D (bottom half) includes below-average trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, high health satisfaction, frequent exercise, robust circadian rhythmicity and normal resting heart rate, and overall behavioral engagement. Evidence consistent with higher CES-D (top half) is present but modest: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI>5), lower self-reported current happiness, late and variable sleep timing, and elevated evening screen use. On balance, the convergent signals from trait measures and objective physiology (strong circadian structure, low intradaily variability, normal resting HR) and the absence of marked stress or substance-use concerns outweigh the modest risk signals from subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the CES-D distribution for this sample.

The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72), relatively high self-esteem (RSES-related Z = 0.96) and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 1.05); each of these measures has moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71; health satisfaction r ≈ -0.39) such that the participant’s pattern on these scales points toward fewer depressive symptoms. Self-reported current happiness is slightly below the study mean (Happy Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS Z = 0.10), suggesting some momentary or contextual dissatisfaction but not a pervasive pattern of elevated stress or trait negative affect.

Social and behavioral indicators are largely protective. The participant reports frequent group exercise (exercised with others three times/week or more, Z = 1.23), moderate socializing (1–2 hours, Z = 0.16) and low recreational drug use; these behaviors are associated in the study with lower CES-D scores (exercise-with-others r ≈ -0.23). There is some leisure behavior indicative of sedentary time (sedentary hobby Z = 1.41) and weekly beer use (Z = 1.01), but correlations of these behaviors with CES-D in the sample are small. Overall, the social-activity and exercise profile is more consistent with engagement and social support than with the withdrawal pattern often associated with higher depressive symptom burden.

Objective wearable-derived physiology and sleep further support a pattern of circadian robustness and generally good physiological fitness. Heart rate–based circadian features show a relatively large amplitude (Amplitude Z = 1.26) with a clear afternoon/evening acrophase (~5:26 PM) and strong daytime heart rate elevations (largest positive deviations in mid/late afternoon) paired with deep overnight troughs; these features indicate a pronounced and regular daily rhythm rather than a blunted or highly irregular profile. Nonparametric rhythm metrics are near or slightly above the study mean for interdaily stability (Z = 0.33) and intradaily variability (Z = 0.67) but show no strong correlations with CES-D in this sample. Resting heart rate is low (47.8 bpm, Z = -1.23), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Sleep metrics show long median sleep duration (8 h 29 m, Z = 1.61), relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = -1.06), and few naps; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is marginally elevated (PSQI = 6, categorized as disturbed sleep) but the objective pattern is one of regular, relatively abundant sleep. Taken together, the wearable data point to preserved circadian organization and cardiovascular fitness, both of which tend to accompany lower depressive symptom levels in the cohort.

Integrative interpretation and likelihood regarding CES-D position: multiple independent domains converge on a lower depressive symptom profile. Strong protective signals include low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, high health satisfaction, frequent social/group exercise, regular and abundant sleep, pronounced circadian amplitude, and low resting heart rate. Minor risk or ambivalent signals include a borderline PSQI score, slightly lower momentary happiness, and some sedentary leisure time, but these indicators have weaker correlations with CES-D in the sample or are small in magnitude. Given the balance of evidence and the direction and strength of key correlates (especially STAI and self-esteem), the participant is more consistent with the lower half of the CES-D distribution in this population.

50766,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Self-report profile — psychological traits and behaviors: The participant’s self-report pattern indicates several markers typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI) is below the sample mean (score 37, Z ≈ -0.43) and perceived stress is also lower than average (PSS score 19, Z ≈ -0.71), both of which are strongly associated with lower CES-D scores in the study correlations. Self-esteem is above average relative to the sample (Z ≈ 0.68) and health satisfaction is relatively high (Z ≈ 0.97); high self-esteem and better perceived health are negatively correlated with CES-D in this dataset and therefore are protective signals. Reported current happiness is somewhat below average (Z ≈ -0.53), and the PSQI indicates subjective sleep disturbance (score 7), which could be a modest adverse influence on mood; nevertheless, many key affective and stress-related self-reports point toward lower overall depressive symptoms rather than elevated symptoms.

Behavioral and social habits: The participant reports frequent group exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z ≈ 1.23) and routine sports participation, behaviors that are modestly negatively correlated with CES-D and are plausibly protective. Alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2×/week), recreational drug use is infrequent, and non-prescription drug use is absent. A notable behavioral risk signal is very limited time spent socializing with friends (15 minutes or less daily; Z ≈ -2.20), which could reflect reduced social engagement; however, in this dataset the correlation between self-reported socializing duration and CES-D is near zero, so its predictive weight here is limited. Overall activity and lifestyle indicators lean toward engagement and supports rather than isolation or substance-related risk.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian, and cardiac physiology: Objective wearable data indicate a well-structured circadian and activity profile. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are high (Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -1.16), and amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is relatively large (Z ≈ 1.63). These features reflect regular, consolidated day–night patterns and are generally associated with better mood regulation. Median nightly sleep duration is within a healthy range (≈7 h 29 min, Z ≈ 0.37) with modest night-to-night variability; the median sleep start time is late (≈01:27), but sleep duration and low fragmentation suggest adequate sleep quantity and regularity overall. Resting heart rate is normal (≈58 bpm). Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show strong nocturnal declines and pronounced afternoon/early-evening elevations (notably a very large deviation around 3–4 PM), consistent with clear wake–activity periods. Taken together, objective physiology and sleep metrics suggest preserved circadian organization and sufficient sleep duration, factors that tend to align with lower depressive symptom burden.

Integrated interpretation relative to CES-D: Several of the strongest correlates of CES-D in this dataset point toward lower depressive symptomatology for this participant: relatively low trait anxiety, higher-than-average self-esteem, low perceived stress, good health satisfaction, regular and robust circadian rhythms, and adequate objective sleep duration. The main countervailing signals are subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI, a somewhat lower self-rating of current happiness, and markedly limited self-reported daily socializing time. However, the strongest measured predictors in the sample (trait anxiety and self-esteem) are favorable and their correlations with CES-D are large; objective wearable measures also provide supportive evidence of circadian regularity rather than dysregulation. On balance, the multimodal evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms rather than in the upper half.

71089,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"The self-report profile indicates notable affective vulnerability. Trait anxiety on the STAI is elevated (score 46, Z = 0.46) and the participant reports relatively low self-esteem (RSES score 27, Z = -1.57). In this study the STAI and self-esteem scores have strong correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.81 and r ≈ -0.71, respectively); given those relationships, the combination of above-average anxiety proneness and substantially below-average self-esteem is a potent indicator of higher depressive symptom burden. Self-rated happiness is lower than the sample mean (score 3, Z = -0.53; r ≈ -0.46 with CES-D), and global health satisfaction is low (score 2.33, Z = -1.45; r ≈ -0.39), both of which align with greater depressive symptomatology in the sample. Perceived stress is not elevated relative to peers (PSS score 19, Z = -0.71), which provides a partial counterpoint but has a smaller explanatory correlation with CES-D in this dataset.

Behavioral habits reinforce risk-related patterns. The participant reports minimal exercise (multiple exercise items marked “not at all,” Z-scores from approximately -1.6 to -1.9) and substantive time spent in sedentary, screen-based recreation (internet use and listening to music each high, Z ≈ 1.5–1.6). In this sample sedentary and screen-based leisure show small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.25), while low participation in group or solo exercise has been associated with higher depressive symptoms. Substance use is minimal and socializing time is above average, which are neutral-to-protective features, but the overall behavioral picture is one of low physical activity and elevated passive leisure.

Objective sleep and circadian measures present a mixed but largely regular picture. Fitbit-derived sleep shows a median nightly duration of about 8 h 12 min (Z = 1.26) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z ≈ -0.85; sleep start SD Z ≈ -0.96) and essentially no napping. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate indicate relatively high interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33), modest amplitude (Z ≈ 0.83) and low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -0.81), consistent with a consolidated and regular daily rhythm. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) meets a threshold often used to indicate disturbed sleep, suggesting some perceived sleep problems despite objectively ample and regular sleep duration. Regular sleep timing and consolidated rhythms are typically protective against depressive symptoms, whereas the subjective disturbance and relatively late median sleep start (~00:50) are potential risk-relevant features.

Physiological data indicate modestly elevated cardiac activation. Resting heart rate is higher than the sample mean (71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55) and the cosinor mesor is likewise elevated (86.93, Z = 1.77). Hourly deviations show an expected nocturnal trough and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:34 PM); there are no large irregularities in the hourly profile. Elevated resting HR and mesor have small positive correlations with CES-D in this cohort (r ≈ 0.19), and when considered alongside elevated trait anxiety they suggest a pattern of increased autonomic arousal that frequently accompanies affective symptoms.

Weighing protective versus risk indicators: protective features include objectively long and regular sleep, stable circadian rhythm metrics, low substance use, and above-average socializing. Risk-relevant and relatively strong indicators include elevated trait anxiety, markedly low self-esteem (a strong predictor in this sample), reduced self-reported happiness, low physical activity, and modestly elevated resting heart rate. Taken holistically, the magnitude and predictive strength of the affective and self-concept measures (particularly low self-esteem and elevated anxiety), together with behavioral inactivity and physiological arousal, outweigh the protective features. On balance the multilevel evidence is more consistent with CES-D scores above the sample median than with low or average depressive symptom burden.

22688,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological synthesis:
Self-report data indicate a profile generally inconsistent with elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 27, Z = -1.41) and relatively high self-regard (SelfEsteem Z = +1.1), both of which have strong correlations with CES-D in this sample (STAI-CESD r ≈ +0.81; SelfEsteem-CESD r ≈ -0.71) and therefore weigh toward lower depressive symptom scores. Current happiness is high (Happy Z = +1.64; Happy–CESD r ≈ -0.46), perceived stress is modestly elevated but near average (PSS Z = +0.38; PSS–CESD r ≈ +0.28), and health satisfaction is above average (Health Satisfaction Z = +1.22; r ≈ -0.39). Sleep self-report (PSQI = 5, classified as “Good Sleep,” Z = -0.8) and objective sleep metrics are also reassuring: median nightly sleep is long relative to the cohort (8 h 2 m, Z = +1.05), sleep timing is fairly consistent (median start ~00:34; start-time SD Z = -0.79), and night-to-night variability is low (sleep SD Z = -0.51). Taken together, subjective and objective sleep both point away from sleep-related risk for depressive symptoms in this participant.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac measures provide a mixed but largely non-alarming picture. Resting heart rate is close to the cohort mean (60.4 bpm, Z = +0.27) and the mesor is near average (Mesor Z ≈ -0.01), with a normal nocturnal decline and afternoon rises in hourly heart-rate deviation consistent with typical daily activity. Circadian regularity measures are lower than the cohort average (interdaily stability Z = -1.15; autocorrelation at 24h Z = -1.79), and intradaily variability is low (Z = -1.8), indicating less strong day-to-day rhythmicity but also low fragmentation. However, the correlations between these wearable circadian metrics and CES-D in this sample are small (typically near zero or modest), so their contribution to predicting depressive symptoms for this participant is limited. Behavioral activity reports show frequent group exercise (exercised with others ≥3×/wk, Z = +1.23; exercise-with-others–CESD r ≈ -0.23) and ongoing social engagement, which are factors typically associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Evidence for lower (bottom-half) CES-D placement:
Multiple high-weight indicators point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Low trait anxiety (strong positive predictor if high), elevated self-esteem (strong negative predictor if high), high current happiness, good subjective sleep quality, objectively long and regular sleep, above-average health satisfaction, and frequent social/group exercise all align with lower CES-D scores. Several of these measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the cohort (notably STAI and SelfEsteem), and the participant’s Z-scores on those dimensions are in the direction associated with lower CES-D.

Evidence for higher (top-half) CES-D placement:
There is limited evidence that would point toward elevated depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is somewhat above average (PSS Z ≈ +0.38), and some circadian stability metrics are lower than average (interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation), which could reflect less consistent daily structure. Resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ +0.19) and is slightly above mean (Z ≈ +0.27). However, these signals are modest in magnitude, and correlations with CES-D for circadian measures are small in this sample, reducing their weight in predicting higher depressive symptoms.

Holistic assessment and conclusion:
Balancing self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiology, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the cohort for depressive symptoms. Strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, good and sufficient sleep, social exercise, and high health satisfaction) outweigh the limited and weak signals that could point to elevated symptoms (slightly higher perceived stress and reduced circadian stability). Therefore the participant is most consistent with having a CES-D score in the bottom 50% of the study population.

38815,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Psychological trait and self-report profile:
The participant presents a mixed but overall resilient psychological profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is slightly above the sample mean and, given a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.81), represents the single self-report feature most strongly tied to depressive symptoms; however, the absolute elevation is modest. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), indicating an important protective factor. Self-reported current happiness is above average (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55) and health satisfaction is notably high (5.67, Z = 1.05), both of which are associated with lower CES-D scores (moderate negative correlations). Perceived stress is only slightly elevated (PSS = 22, Z = 0.1) and thus provides limited additional risk. Interpersonal trust is relatively low (score = 2.5, Z = -1.42), a factor that correlates negatively with mental health and could modestly increase risk, but this is one domain among several protective indicators.

Sleep and subjective sleep quality:
Subjective sleep quality is somewhat disturbed (PSQI = 7, above the common cutpoint of 5), which is a known correlate of depressive symptoms. Objective sleep duration from the wearable is near the sample mean (median 7 hours 3 minutes; Z = -0.16), but sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ~00:50) and sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 136 minutes, Z = 0.8). The dataset correlations indicate that greater sleep variability and poorer subjective sleep associate modestly with higher CES-D; thus the participant’s disturbed PSQI and variable sleep duration represent modest risk signals even though average nightly sleep duration is adequate.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular features:
Cardiovascular circadian structure shows some irregularity: interdaily stability is reduced (0.31, Z = -0.82) and 24-hour autocorrelation is low (Z = -0.53), suggesting less consistent day-to-day heart rate timing. Intradaily variability is near sample mean (Z = 0.1). The cosinor mesor is low (65.9 bpm, Z = -1.10) and resting heart rate is notably low (47.5 bpm, Z = -1.27), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness; these lower heart rate indices have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.19), so in this dataset they do not strongly signal elevated depressive symptoms. Amplitude is moderately elevated (Z = 0.58) with a typical acrophase in the early evening (~5:55 PM), and hourly heart rate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and robust daytime peaks (particularly mid- to late-afternoon). Taken together, physiological data indicate a pronounced day/night heart rate contrast and low resting heart rate—patterns more consistent with physical fitness and a preserved physiological rhythm than with severe depressive-related blunting, although the lower interdaily stability and moderate intraday variability indicate some irregularity in daily structure that could modestly relate to mood.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
Behavioral reporting suggests active engagement in several protective activities: frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more, Z = 1.07) and low recreational drug use. Time spent socializing is modest (1–2 hours, near average) while internet use and listening to music are above average (Z = 1.52 and 1.13 respectively); higher internet use shows a small positive correlation with CES-D in the sample. Alcohol use is moderate and not extreme. Overall, the behavioral profile tilts toward adaptive health behaviors (regular exercise, healthy BMI, low drug use) with some solitary patterns (exercise alone, low trust) and higher screen time that could contribute small increases in depressive symptom risk.

Integration and overall interpretation:
The profile contains both risk and protective signals. The strongest single statistical risk linkage in the dataset is trait anxiety (high correlation with CES-D), and this participant’s STAI is slightly above average. Subjective disturbed sleep and elevated sleep variability also provide modest risk signals. Conversely, strong protective features—high self-esteem, above-average happiness, high health satisfaction, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, and generally adequate median sleep duration—are prominent and are tied in the sample to lower CES-D scores (notably self-esteem has a large inverse association). Physiological rhythms show preserved daytime–nighttime contrast and low resting heart rate that are not typical of severe depressive physiology; circadian regularity is somewhat reduced but not profoundly so. On balance, protective indicators (strong self-esteem, positive affect, health satisfaction, fitness and regular exercise) outweigh the modest risk indicators (slightly elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, reduced interpersonal trust, and some sleep/circadian irregularity).

Conclusion regarding CES-D percentile:
Weighing the relative magnitude of risk versus protective signals and the known correlations in this dataset, the overall evidence is more consistent with a CES-D score in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively low to average depressive symptom burden) rather than the top half.

72885,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"The self-report profile indicates several features commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and this measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study sample (r = 0.81), which suggests that their anxiety proneness is a robust predictor of higher depression scores. Self-esteem is lower than the sample mean (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01) and self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), again pointing toward higher depressive symptom risk. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98; classified as disturbed), a clinically meaningful elevation in reported sleep problems that commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptoms. By contrast, perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17) and current self-rated happiness is modestly above average (Current Happy Z = 0.55), which provide limited countervailing evidence but do not outweigh the stronger risk signals above.

Objective sleep and circadian metrics from the wearable further reinforce a pattern associated with elevated symptom burden. Median nightly sleep duration is short (5 h 59 min, Z = -1.5) and the participant’s median sleep onset is very late (03:44 AM), indicating a delayed sleep schedule. Circadian regularity metrics are reduced: interdaily stability is low (0.25, Z = -1.32) and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is lower than average (amplitude Z = -1.0). These features—short sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, and attenuated circadian amplitude—are frequently linked with worse mood and depression-related outcomes. Nighttime heart rate deviations show an anomalous elevation at 1–2 AM (mean deviation +6.66, Z = 2.04), which may indicate episodes of nocturnal physiological arousal or fragmented rest on many nights, consistent with the participant’s high PSQI.

Behavioral habit indicators show additional risk-relevant patterns. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are substantially elevated relative to peers (reported recreational drugs 1–2 times/week, Z = 5.44; non-prescribed drugs less than 1–2 times/month but Z = 6.84), and both measures have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.16–0.17). Social and physical-activity engagement is low (exercising with others: not at all, Z = -1.58; sports: not at all, Z = -1.09; socializing with friends moderately below average, Z = -0.62). Increased solitary sedentary leisure (video games 1–2 hrs, Z = 2.47) and decreased social/active engagement are behavioral patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated depressive symptoms. Other health indicators (low BMI = 17.33) and reduced interpersonal trust (Z = -1.42) further suggest psychosocial and physical vulnerability.

Integrative interpretation and ranking decision: multiple convergent signals—elevated trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES-D), low self-esteem (strong negative correlate), markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI high), objectively short and irregular sleep timing, nocturnal heart rate elevations, minimal social and exercise engagement, and very high recreational/non-prescribed drug use—collectively point toward a higher depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. Although a few measures (perceived stress near average, modestly elevated self-reported happiness, lower resting heart rate) temper the picture, they are weaker or less predictive given the strong associations of anxiety, low self-esteem, and sleep disturbance with CES-D in this sample. On balance, the pattern of self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiology is most consistent with placement in the upper half of the CES-D distribution.

The participant’s STAI–Trait score (60; z = 1.85) is well above the sample mean and is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.81), which positions chronic anxiety proneness as a major contributor to depressive symptom variance. Rosenberg self-esteem is relatively low (score = 28; z = -1.43) and negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), reinforcing that low self-worth is another strong predictor of higher depressive symptoms in this case. Self-reported current happiness is low (score = 2.0; z = -1.61) and perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25; z = 0.92), both of which are consistent with greater affective distress and align with expected associations to higher CES-D scores. Subjective sleep quality is also disturbed (PSQI = 8), exceeding common clinical thresholds and suggesting sleep-related complaints that commonly co-occur with elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics show a relatively robust and regular circadian organization but a late and stable sleep timing. Heart rate cosinor metrics indicate a clear daily rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.60, z = 1.57; autocorrelation at 24 h z = 1.82) and relatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability z = -1.24), suggesting structured day-to-day patterns in activity/arousal. Resting heart rate is in the typical range (59 bpm) and overall mesor and amplitude are near-sample-average to modestly elevated. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced daytime elevations in mid-afternoon (peaks around 2–4 pm with z-scores up to ~2.3) and large nocturnal troughs, consistent with consolidated sleep and daytime activity. Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 2 min; z = 1.05) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD z = -1.04), yet the median sleep start time is late (≈01:47 AM) and sleep complaints are present subjectively (PSQI). This pattern—stable but late sleep timing with reported poor sleep quality—can be associated with mood disturbance despite objective consolidation.

Behavioral and lifestyle data reveal limited social and physical engagement with low reported exercise and minimal socializing, alongside high sedentary recreational time in the form of elevated video game use (video games z = 2.47) and sedentary hobbies (z = 1.41). Substance use is negligible. Low frequency of exercising with others and low social interaction, together with higher sedentary screen time, are behavioral patterns that frequently co-occur with elevated depressive symptom indices, though in this dataset their direct correlations with CES-D are modest. A small increase in daytime napping frequency (mean daily naps z = 1.34) and a modest association between sleep variability and CES-D (r ≈ 0.21) suggest some behavioral sleep–wake irregularities that may compound subjective sleep complaints.

Integrative interpretation: several of the strongest, most directly CES-D–linked signals in the profile point toward elevated depressive symptom burden. High trait anxiety (strong positive correlate), low self-esteem (strong negative correlate), low current happiness, elevated perceived stress, and clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance collectively provide converging evidence for higher depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. Objective wearable indicators (robust circadian rhythmicity, consolidated sleep duration, normal resting HR) are somewhat protective or neutral and argue against severe circadian desynchronization, but they do not outweigh the strong self-report indicators that have high correlations with CES-D in this dataset. Taking the balance of evidence together—particularly the high STAI, low self-esteem, low happiness, elevated perceived stress, and PSQI > 5—I judge that this participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is more consistent with the upper half of the study population distribution.

98760,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Trait-level self-report and momentary affect indicate a profile that is, on balance, inconsistent with high depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) and relatively high self-esteem (Rosenberg, Z = 0.82), both measures that have strong, expected correlations with CES-D in this sample (STAI positive, self-esteem negative). Current self-reported happiness is elevated (Current Happy = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and perceived stress is lower than the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.71). These three signals—low chronic anxiety, high self-regard, and higher momentary happiness—are among the strongest individual correlates to lower CES-D scores in the study and together suggest relatively low depressive symptomatology.

Health behavior and social engagement present a mixed but largely protective pattern. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; exercise alone Z = 1.07) and minimal substance use, both patterns typically associated with lower depression risk. However, social recreation is limited (socializing 16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41) and many leisure activities are reportedly minimal, which could attenuate some social support benefits. Overall, the behavioral profile reflects healthy physical activity and low substance exposure but relatively low social/recreational engagement; given the modest correlations of these activity measures with CES-D in this sample, the net influence is likely small-to-moderate and not strongly elevating depression risk.

Sleep and circadian/physiological data show a mixture of risk and resilience indicators. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, classified as disturbed; Z = 1.05), and the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean (6 h 52 min, Z = -0.39) with a very late median sleep start time (~01:58). These sleep features (disturbed sleep and late bedtime) are commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, heart-rate–derived circadian structure shows robust amplitude (Amplitude Z = 1.64) and moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.5), while resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm, Z = -0.61). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations present expected nocturnal decreases and pronounced evening increases (largest positive deviations between ~6–9 pm, with the largest Z at 8–9 pm), suggesting an evening peak of physiological arousal. Taken together, objective physiology suggests a generally intact and relatively robust circadian rhythm with an evening arousal pattern; this physiological robustness and low resting heart rate are features more commonly associated with lower depressive symptom burden, whereas the subjective sleep disturbance and very late bedtime point toward potential sleep-related risk.

Holistic integration and weighting of evidence favors a lower-to-average depressive symptom profile. The strongest individual indicators in this dataset (low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, elevated self-reported happiness) are strongly linked with lower CES-D scores in the study correlations and carry more predictive weight than the weaker associations from exercise or socializing. Objective circadian metrics show preserved rhythmicity (high amplitude and moderate interdaily stability) and low resting heart rate, further supporting resilience against elevated depressive symptoms. The principal countervailing signals are the participant’s disturbed subjective sleep and late sleep timing; these are notable risk features but, within the broader multimodal pattern, appear insufficient to outweigh the multiple strong protective signals.

95374,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, z ≈ 0.56) and low momentary happiness (current happiness = 2.0, z ≈ -1.61), both of which are features commonly associated with higher depressive symptom scores in this sample (STAI–Trait correlates strongly with CES-D, r ≈ 0.81; happiness correlates negatively with CES-D, r ≈ -0.46). At the same time, the participant’s self-esteem score is relatively high (Rosenberg-style score z ≈ 0.96), and self-esteem in this dataset is strongly inversely associated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71). Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS z ≈ -0.71), which would tend to predict fewer depressive symptoms. Overall, the self-report pattern is mixed: elevated chronic anxiety and low immediate happiness point toward greater symptom burden, whereas high global self-esteem and lower perceived stress point toward lower burden.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 9, z ≈ 1.05), indicating more self-reported sleep disturbance than the average participant. Fitbit-derived sleep duration is within the typical range for this sample (median = 7h15m, z ≈ 0.09), but night-to-night variability in sleep duration is high (SD ≈ 219 min, z ≈ 2.68) and sleep onset timing is very late on average (median start ≈ 03:11) with elevated variability (start-time SD z ≈ 1.43). These objective features—irregular sleep timing and large variability—are modestly positively correlated with CES-D in the sample and are considered risk-relevant patterns. In contrast, circadian features derived from heart rate show preserved structure: a relatively large amplitude (z ≈ 2.06) and modest interdaily stability (z ≈ 0.42) with low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ 0.17). Resting heart rate is relatively low (51.4 bpm, z ≈ -0.8), a pattern generally associated with better cardiovascular fitness and is modestly associated with lower CES-D in this sample. Taken together, objective physiology shows intact and robust diurnal rhythmicity and low resting heart rate (protective), but sleep timing irregularity and subjective sleep disturbance (risk).

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant reports minimal use of alcohol or recreational/nonprescribed drugs and high levels of social time (socializing with friends reported 3–4 hours/day, z ≈ 1.74), both of which tend to be neutral or protective with respect to depressive symptoms in this dataset. Exercise is reportedly absent (exercised alone/with others: “not at all”, z’s strongly negative), a behavioral absence that is modestly associated with higher CES-D in the sample. Sedentary recreational activities such as video gaming are elevated (video games z ≈ 2.47) and time watching videos is above average; these sedentary leisure patterns have small positive correlations with CES-D. Overall lifestyle indicators are mixed but lean somewhat protective (low substance use, high social time) despite limited exercise and increased sedentary recreation.

Integrated interpretation with respect to CES-D burden: Weighing the evidence across modalities yields a mixed picture but leans toward a relatively lower-to-moderate depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. Strong inverse predictors of higher CES-D are present (notably higher self-esteem with a large sample correlation, preserved and even high circadian amplitude, low resting heart rate, substantial social time, and low substance use). Offsetting risks include elevated trait anxiety (a strong correlate of CES-D), poor subjective sleep quality, markedly irregular and late sleep timing, low momentary happiness, and lack of reported exercise. Several of the objective wearable markers that are most consistently associated with lower depressive symptoms (robust amplitude and lower resting HR) are present, while some subjective risk indicators are also present. On balance, the protective signals appear sufficiently prominent that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the CES-D distribution (i.e., comparatively lower or around-average symptom burden) rather than the upper half.

71985,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but overall non-elevated profile of affective symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 41) is near the study mean (Z ≈ -0.03) and therefore does not show a pronounced anxiety burden; because trait anxiety correlates strongly with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), the absence of an elevated STAI score argues against a high concurrent depressive symptom load. Self-esteem is relatively good (RSES = 34) though modestly below the study mean (Z = -0.59); given the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), this level of self-esteem is a protective indicator against elevated depressive symptoms. Momentary well-being items are also consistent with lower symptom burden: self-rated happiness is above average (Z ≈ 0.55) and perceived stress is only moderately elevated (PSS score = 23, Z ≈ 0.38). One notable self-report concern is comparatively low health satisfaction (score 2.67, Z ≈ -1.2), which could modestly relate to affective distress, but this is one domain among many and its correlation with CES-D is moderate.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators largely align with adaptive functioning. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.07), minimal substance use, no reported naps, and routine social time with friends (1–2 hours). Recreational screen time includes elevated video game use (Z ≈ 2.47), which may reflect sedentary leisure preferences but is not strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset. Sleep-related self-report and Fitbit-derived sleep statistics converge on generally adequate sleep: median nightly sleep of about 7 hours 18 minutes (Z ≈ 0.14), a PSQI score at the conventional threshold (PSQI = 5, classified as “Good Sleep” by the provided summary), and no daily naps. Sleep timing is slightly late (median sleep start ~00:21) with some night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes), but overall duration and frequency metrics do not signal marked insomnia or hypersomnia patterns that typically accompany higher depressive symptomatology.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian features show robust and regular daily structure consistent with healthy regulation. Non-parametric circadian stability metrics are high (interdaily stability = 0.66, Z ≈ 2.07; 24-hour autocorrelation Z ≈ 1.74), indicating a consistent day-to-day rhythm. Cosinor-derived amplitude is above average (Z ≈ 1.01) and the acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:37 PM) is within a typical daytime activity peak. Resting heart rate and mesor are below the population mean (resting HR = 50 bpm, mesor ≈ 66.4, both Z ≈ -1), consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness; the hourly aggregate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dip and clear daytime elevations, reflecting preserved circadian modulation of autonomic tone. Those physiological signatures (regular, higher-amplitude rhythms and a clear nocturnal dip) are generally associated with better mood regulation and are not characteristic of the blunted circadian patterns often reported with higher depressive symptomatology.

Weighing the evidence for lower versus higher depressive symptom burden: indicators suggesting lower CES-D values include average-to-low trait anxiety (despite its strong correlation with CES-D), relatively high self-esteem, positive momentary happiness ratings, regular exercise, adequate and regular sleep duration, and robust circadian/physiological rhythms (high interdaily stability, clear nocturnal HR dip, low resting HR). Evidence pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms is limited and mainly consists of moderate perceived stress and lower health satisfaction; these are relevant but smaller in magnitude and less predictive in this dataset than the protective factors noted. Given the pattern and the relative strengths of the predictors (notably the strong predictive weight of STAI and self-esteem, both of which favor lower CES-D burden in this case), the preponderance of multimodal evidence indicates that this participant’s depressive symptom burden is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

43125,37.0,0.9715025906735751,"Trait and symptom self-report: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53, Z = 1.16), a measure that correlates strongly with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), and comparatively low self-esteem (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73; r with CES-D = -0.71). Subjective well-being indices are reduced (self-reported happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.7) and perceived stress is not markedly elevated relative to the sample (PSS Z = -0.44), but the combination of high trait anxiety and low self-esteem are both strong statistical predictors of greater depressive symptom burden in this cohort and therefore weigh heavily in interpretation.

Sleep and circadian subjectivity/objective divergence: The participant’s objective median sleep duration is near or slightly above the sample median (7 h 28 min, Z = 0.35) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD 72 min, Z = -0.66). However, sleep timing is late and consistent (median sleep start ~02:00, start-time SD Z = -0.82), and the participant reports substantially disturbed sleep subjectively (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), indicating perceived poor sleep quality despite adequate total duration. Subjective poor sleep quality is commonly linked with elevated depressive symptoms; this subjective/objective divergence (adequate duration but disturbed subjective quality and late timing) is relevant for mood risk.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac profile: Heart-rate cosinor metrics indicate a reasonably strong diurnal rhythm (amplitude Z = 1.36; MESOR Z = 0.62) with an evening acrophase (~18:29), moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.25), and relatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -0.39). Hourly aggregated deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline in heart rate (large negative deviations in early morning hours) and elevated heart rate in late evening/early night (multiple evening hours with positive deviations, many Z > 1). Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.8 bpm, Z = -0.4). In sum, the participant has a robust, phase-delayed circadian cardiac rhythm with greater evening physiological activation; these features do not strongly point to blunted circadian amplitude or fragmentation that sometimes accompany higher depressive burden, but the evening activation paired with late sleep timing aligns with behavioral patterns (late schedule, evening arousal) that can relate to mood symptoms.

Behavioral lifestyle correlates: The participant reports minimal exercise or team/sports activity (exercise alone and with others: both “not at all”, Zs ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and limited socializing (Z = -0.62). Substance use is notable: frequent beer consumption (three times a week or more, Z = 1.72) and recreational drug use reported 1–2 times per week (Z = 5.44), the latter being an extreme outlier in the sample. These behaviors (low physical and social activity; relatively high alcohol and recreational drug use) are either modestly correlated with CES-D in the sample or are clinically relevant lifestyle risk factors for mood problems.

Integrated assessment relevant to depressive symptom burden: Strongest signals that predict higher CES-D in this dataset are elevated trait anxiety (high STAI, r = 0.81) and low self-esteem (RSES, r = -0.71), both present and of substantial magnitude here. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.52) and behavioral risk factors (low exercise/social contact, elevated substance use) further support elevated risk. Countervailing or ambiguous evidence includes objectively adequate total sleep time and preserved circadian amplitude/stability (which reduce the likelihood of severe circadian disruption), and a relatively low resting heart rate; these moderate the overall picture but do not outweigh the strong self-report signals. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (especially the high-anxiety trait and low self-esteem paired with subjective sleep disturbance and risky substance/exercise patterns) indicates that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the CES-D distribution within this study population.

98117,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple signals that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is high (STAI = 53; Z = 1.16) and is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.81), indicating that anxiety-prone temperament is a salient correlate of higher depressive symptoms for this individual. Global self-worth is relatively low (Rosenberg = 32; Z = −0.87) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ −0.71), which supports an expectation of higher depressive symptom burden. Self-rated happiness is low (current = 2.0; Z = −1.61) and interpersonal trust is markedly low (Z = −2.07), both characteristics that, in this dataset, are associated with higher CES-D scores. Reported perceived stress is modest (PSS score 22; Z ≈ 0.1) and academic performance (GPA history) is adequate, but these do not counterbalance the pattern of high anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, and low interpersonal trust.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators:
Reported daily activities show behavioral patterns frequently linked with depressive symptom elevation: minimal socializing (15 minutes or less; Z = −2.2), no reported exercise (Zs between −1.09 and −1.93 across exercise items), high passive screen time (internet >4 hours; Z = 2.19; TV/video 2–3 hours; Z = 1.91), and no alcohol or drug use. Low social engagement combined with low physical activity and high solitary screen-based behavior is consistent with behavioral withdrawal and reduced rewarding activity, both of which commonly co-occur with higher CES-D scores in college samples.

Sleep and circadian physiology:
Sleep subjectively and objectively indicates disturbance and high irregularity. The PSQI score (8; Z = 0.59) classifies disturbed sleep. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is slightly short (6 h 37 m; Z = −0.71) but the variability in sleep duration is extreme (SD = 234 minutes; Z = 3.02), and sleep start times are very delayed on average (median start ≈ 04:03 AM) with very high variability (start time SD Z = 4.33). This combination—short average sleep, very late timing, and marked night-to-night irregularity—is a pattern that is commonly associated with worse mood and higher CES-D scores. Nonzero correlations in the dataset between sleep irregularity measures and CES-D (e.g., sleep start SD r ≈ 0.19, sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.17) align with this interpretation.

Wearable heart-rate and circadian rhythm metrics:
Physiological signals show modest signs of autonomic and circadian alteration. Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 66.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.98; mesor Z ≈ 0.96) and have small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), consistent with mild sympathetic predominance or lower cardiovascular fitness in the context of affective distress. Circadian amplitude is slightly reduced (amplitude Z ≈ −0.42) while interdaily stability is near average and intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ −1.73). The low intradaily variability may reflect extended periods of low activity (less ultradian fragmentation) rather than robust circadian organization; taken together with the pronounced night-to-night sleep timing irregularity, the wearable data suggest irregular sleep timing and blunted day–night activity contrast rather than a strongly rhythmic, well-entrained pattern.

Integrated interpretation and assessment relative to the study distribution:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the balance of indicators supports a profile consistent with relatively elevated depressive symptoms in this sample. Strong contributors to this inference are (1) high trait anxiety that is highly correlated with CES-D in the cohort, (2) low self-esteem and low reported happiness with strong sample correlations to CES-D, (3) behavioral withdrawal (minimal socializing, no exercise) and high solitary screen time, and (4) disturbed, very late, and highly irregular sleep timing with supporting wearable circadian/heart-rate markers (elevated resting HR and somewhat blunted amplitude). Evidence that might argue against very high CES-D (e.g., modest perceived stress, intact GPA, minimal substance use) is present but relatively weak compared with the consistent pattern of affective, behavioral, sleep, and physiological markers linked to higher CES-D in the dataset.

Final classification:
{""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
24883,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"Psychological trait and self-report profile: The participant reports a modestly elevated state of perceived stress (PSS = 23, z ≈ 0.38) and an STAI–Trait score near the study mean (STAI = 42, z ≈ 0.07), indicating some anxiety proneness but not markedly above the sample average. Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (z ≈ -0.53). The Rosenberg self-esteem index shows a large positive z-score (z ≈ 1.52), which—given the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D in this sample (r ≈ -0.71)—is a notable indicator favoring relatively lower depressive symptomatology. A caveat is that the raw self-esteem value appears inconsistent with the expected scale; however the provided z-score and its correlation with CES-D were used in interpretation and point to comparatively high self-regard.

Behavioral and social activity indicators: The participant reports minimal exercise, almost no exercise with others or sports (z-scores typically << 0), and very low time spent socializing with friends (z ≈ -1.41). Recreational engagement is generally low. Alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week) is slightly above average (z ≈ 1.0), while non-prescribed and recreational drug use is absent. Low social activity, reduced group exercise and low interpersonal trust (trust z ≈ -1.1) are behavioral features that can relate to higher depressive symptoms in some studies, but in this dataset the correlations between these specific activity items and CES-D are small or mixed.

Sleep timing and subjective sleep quality: The participant’s sleep profile is characterized by a late median sleep start time (around 03:00), a median nightly duration just under 7 hours (6 h 53 m, z ≈ -0.38), and a PSQI score of 6 (classified as disturbed sleep). This pattern—late sleep timing with borderline-short duration and a PSQI above the common cutoff—conveys subjective sleep disruption and circadian misalignment. Sleep regularity measures (sleep start SD ~69 minutes, sleep duration SD ~88 minutes) are modestly variable but not extreme. Subjective sleep disturbance and delayed sleep phase are both features that often co-occur with elevated depressive symptoms, though in this case the effect sizes (z-scores) are small-to-moderate.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiology markers: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show relatively low rhythm amplitude and modestly reduced mesor (amplitude z ≈ -1.11; mesor z ≈ -0.67). Interdaily stability and intradaily variability are lower than average (z ≈ -0.99 and -1.31, respectively), suggesting less pronounced day-to-day coupling and low within-day fragmentation of heart rate rhythms; autocorrelation at 24 hours is near the sample mean. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.2 bpm, z ≈ -0.71), which often reflects higher cardiovascular fitness and is weakly associated with lower CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.19 reported but small). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show elevated HR relative to mesor around late evening and early night hours (notably 12–3am) and pronounced negative deviations across the early morning (3–8am), consistent with a shifted daily rhythm and late sleep timing. Overall, circadian/physiological indicators point to a delayed schedule and lower amplitude rhythm but do not provide a strong signal of marked physiological arousal that would robustly predict elevated depressive symptoms in this cohort.

Integrated interpretation relative to CES-D distribution: Several features in the participant’s profile point in opposite directions. Markers that suggest increased depressive symptom risk include disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI >5), late sleep timing, low social interaction and low group exercise, low interpersonal trust, and modestly elevated perceived stress. However, the most influential available predictor in this dataset—self-esteem— is substantially above average (z ≈ 1.52) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D across the population (r ≈ -0.71), implying a lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptom burden. Anxiety proneness (STAI) is near average rather than high, and physiological indicators such as low resting heart rate and reduced rhythm fragmentation do not strongly signal high depressive symptoms here. Given the relative magnitudes and the strong inverse relationship between self-esteem and CES-D in this sample, the balance of evidence favors a lower-to-average depressive symptom burden.

Final categorical assessment: synthesizing self-report, behavioral, and wearable data—especially the large positive self-esteem z-score in the context of the study correlations—this participant is more likely to have a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

66815,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Self-report measures and trait indicators point toward relatively low-to-moderate affective symptom burden. The participant reports elevated momentary happiness (Happy = 5.0; Z = 1.64) and relatively high interpersonal trust (Z = 1.47), both of which have moderate negative correlations with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ -0.46 and -0.41 respectively), suggesting these features are protective against depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is above the sample mean (SelfEsteem Z = 0.54) and strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in the study (r = -0.71), which further indicates lower likelihood of high depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 41, Z ≈ -0.03, classified “anxious”) is near the sample average; although anxiety and depression are correlated in the cohort (STAI–CES-D r = 0.81), the participant’s STAI score does not appear markedly elevated relative to peers.

Lifestyle and behavioral indices generally align with lower risk for depressive symptoms. The participant reports minimal substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational drugs all “Not at all,” Z-scores strongly negative), frequent exercise with others (three times a week or more; Z = 1.23) and little solitary exercise. Regular partnered or group physical activity is associated here with lower CES-D (exercise-with-others r ≈ -0.23). Daily recreational engagement in passive activities (TV, video games, music, reading) is unusually low (Z-scores strongly negative across items), and reported socializing time is relatively low (16–30 minutes; Z = -1.41), which could reflect constrained social contact in daily logs but is offset by the high frequency of social exercise. Perceived stress is near the cohort mean (PSS = 22, Z = 0.1), and health satisfaction is not notably low, both of which do not point strongly toward elevated depressive burden.

Sleep self-report and objective sleep metrics are largely consistent with normative functioning. The PSQI score is 5.0 (classified here as “Good Sleep,” Z = -0.8), and median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is ~7 hours 6 minutes (Z = -0.11), with low day-to-day variability in duration (SD = 40 minutes; Z = -1.38). These sleep quantity and stability metrics show little positive association with higher CES-D in the sample (correlations near zero to small). One notable behavioral pattern is a late median sleep start time (01:49 AM), with moderate night-to-night consistency (start time SD ≈ 56 minutes, Z = -0.6); late sleep timing can be associated with mood disturbance in some work, but in this case other protective factors (sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, active lifestyle) suggest limited downstream impact on depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics indicate robust and well-structured circadian cardiovascular rhythms and high cardiorespiratory fitness. Cosinor-derived amplitude is elevated (Amplitude Z = 1.64) and interdaily stability is above average (Z = 0.83), while mesor and resting heart rate are low (Mesor Z = -1.32; Resting HR = 45.8, Z = -1.47). The participant’s hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show large evening peaks (notably 5–6 PM, Z = 4.07; and 9–10 PM, Z = 3.01) and pronounced night-time troughs, which together yield a high amplitude rhythm. Higher amplitude and greater regularity in circadian metrics are associated in this dataset with lower depressive symptoms or show weak negative correlations with CES-D; the participant’s pattern—low resting HR indicative of fitness, clear diurnal modulation, and relatively stable rhythms—aligns with profiles that are less characteristic of elevated depressive symptomatology.

Integrated interpretation and weighting of evidence: across self-report, behavioral, sleep, and wearable physiological domains the preponderance of indicators point toward lower-than-average depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. Strong inverse predictors of CES-D in this cohort (high self-esteem, higher momentary happiness, frequent social exercise, low substance use) are present and of notable magnitude (several Z-scores > 0.5 and substantial correlations). Objective physiology and circadian structure are similarly consistent with resilience or lower symptom levels (high amplitude, high interdaily stability, low resting HR). The only modest concerns are a late sleep timing and limited self-reported daily passive social time; these are not strongly associated with higher CES-D here and are outweighed by protective features. Taken holistically, the evidence favors placement in the lower half of the CES-D distribution.

89161,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Self-report mental health and trait indicators collectively point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) and high subjective well-being (current happiness = 5, Z = 1.64). Self-esteem is substantially above the study mean (reported Rosenberg score with Z = 1.52), and overall health satisfaction is high (Z = 1.38). Perceived stress is modestly below average (PSS Z = -0.71) and the PSQI places subjective sleep quality at the boundary of “good” (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). The pattern of these self-reports corresponds to variables that, in this dataset, are moderately to strongly associated with CES-D in expected directions (e.g., STAI and CES-D r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71), and the participant’s scores on those measures suggest protection against elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology indicate adequate and relatively regular sleep quantity but a delayed sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 26 min (Z = 0.32) with low night-to-night variability (duration SD Z = -0.94), and the participant reports no habitual napping. However, median sleep onset is late (about 01:56 AM) with a modestly low start-time variability (start-time SD Z = -0.79), indicating a consistently delayed schedule rather than irregular sleep. Heart-rate–based circadian features show a lower-than-average mesor and resting heart rate (mesor Z = -0.86; resting HR Z = -0.51) and slightly reduced amplitude (Z = -0.33). Non-parametric rhythm metrics show somewhat elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = 1.30), suggesting more within-day fragmentation of activity/physiological state, while interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation are near average. Aggregated hourly deviations indicate relatively high late-evening/early-night heart-rate elevations (notably 10–11 PM Z = 1.65 and 11 PM–12 AM Z = 1.29), which aligns with the late sleep onset but does not appear to reflect widespread physiological hyperarousal across the day. Overall, circadian/physiologic signals show a delayed but relatively consistent schedule with some within-day fragmentation; the correlations between these wearable metrics and CES-D in this sample are small, so their contribution to depressive symptom prediction is modest.

Behavioral and social activity patterns are mixed but largely imply effective social engagement and leisure. The participant reports extensive socializing (>4 hours; Z = 2.53) and prolonged music listening (>4 hours; Z = 2.06), both of which reflect sustained social/leisure involvement. Internet use is higher than average (3–4 hours; Z = 1.52). Exercise frequency is low-to-moderate (exercising alone 1–2 times/week; Z = 0.32) and sports/outdoor group exercise are infrequent. Substance use shows a notable exception to otherwise protective patterns: recreational drug use is reported at 1–2 times per week and is a large outlier compared with the sample (Z = 5.44). Correlational evidence in the dataset links recreational drug use only modestly to CES-D (r ≈ 0.18), so while this behavior is an important clinical and behavioral flag, its direct expected contribution to depressive symptom variance in this cohort is limited. Frequent social contact and high self-reported happiness are stronger protective behavioral signals.

Integrative assessment weighing self-report, behavioral, and wearable data: protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, good subjective sleep quality, consistent adequate sleep duration, robust social engagement, and high health satisfaction) are relatively strong and map onto features that, in this population, are meaningfully associated with lower CES-D scores. Risk indicators include frequent recreational drug use (extreme Z), delayed sleep timing with elevated late-evening heart rate (consistent with a late chronotype), and somewhat elevated intradaily variability in wearable signals; however, the measured associations of these risk indicators with CES-D are modest in this sample. Overall, the balance of evidence favors lower-than-average depressive symptomatology: the strongest and most CES-D–relevant measures (anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, perceived stress, sleep quality, and social engagement) consistently point toward fewer symptoms.

Considering the multimodal evidence and the magnitudes of associations in this cohort, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the CES-D distribution (bottom 50%). The protective profile across core psychological variables outweighs the isolated risk behaviors, which show only small-to-moderate expected relations with CES-D in this dataset.

14847,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant endorses pronounced trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86), a variable that in this sample shows a strong positive association with CES-D (r = 0.81). Self-esteem is modestly below the sample mean (RSES = 35, z = -0.45) and is strongly inversely associated with CES-D in this cohort (r = -0.71), indicating that lower self-regard in this individual is a substantive risk marker for higher depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is elevated relative to the sample (PSS = 24, z = 0.65) and shows a modest positive relationship with CES-D (r = 0.28). Interpersonal trust is markedly low (z = -3.03), a trait-level feature that is moderately inversely associated with CES-D (r = -0.41). Together, these survey-derived indicators (high trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, elevated stress, and very low trust) are consistent with a psychosocial profile that typically accompanies increased depressive symptoms in this population.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Both subjective and wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate disrupted sleep patterns. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is high (PSQI = 10, z = 1.52), consistent with clinically meaningful sleep disturbance. Fitbit-derived sleep shows a median nightly duration below the sample mean (6 h 38 m, z = -0.69), large night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 134 min, z = 0.75), late median sleep onset (02:24) and moderately elevated variability in sleep start times (SD z = 0.46). Mean daily naps are elevated (0.24 naps/day, z = 1.9). Circadian summary metrics from heart rate indicate reduced rhythm regularity and increased fragmentation: interdaily stability is somewhat low (z = -0.49) while intradaily variability is notably high (z = 2.01). These sleep and circadian features—poor subjective sleep quality, short and irregular nocturnal sleep, elevated napping, and greater within-day fragmentation—are patterns commonly associated with higher depressive symptomatology and with impaired mood regulation.

Behavioral and physiological activity: Objective cardiac measures (mesor ~74.7 bpm, resting HR ~58.4 bpm) are near the sample average (mesor z = 0.10; RHR z = 0.03) and do not by themselves indicate major autonomic elevation, though hourly deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and modest evening elevations. The participant reports regular solitary exercise (≥3×/week, z = 1.07), which is typically protective, but reports no exercise with others (z = -1.58) and no participation in sports (z = -1.09), suggesting limited social physical activity. Time spent socializing with friends is above average (2–3 hours, z = 0.95), providing some social engagement. Recreational substance use is infrequent, and academic performance indicators (GPAs across terms) are solid. Subjective health satisfaction is relatively high (z = 0.97), which may buffer mood symptoms. Overall, behavioral indicators are mixed: some protective routines (regular solitary exercise, social contact, good academic functioning) coexist with social isolation around structured group activities and physiological markers of circadian disruption.

Integrated interpretation and implications for CES-D rank: Multiple high-weight indicators in this multimodal profile point toward elevated depressive symptom burden. The most salient supporting evidence for higher CES-D risk are the high trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D in this sample), lower self-esteem (strong inverse correlate), markedly disturbed subjective sleep and objective sleep/circadian instability (PSQI high; short, variable, and late sleep with high intradaily variability), elevated perceived stress, and very low interpersonal trust. These features collectively align with patterns observed in participants with higher CES-D scores. Offsetting signals—moderate self-reported happiness, good academic performance, regular solitary exercise, and above-average health satisfaction—provide some resilience but do not fully counterbalance the combination of strong risk indicators (especially trait anxiety and low self-esteem). On balance, the convergent pattern across trait, sleep/circadian, and stress-related measures suggests that this participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

43382,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"Psychological trait and self-report profile:
The participant shows a mixed self-report profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) is moderately elevated and, in this dataset, strongly associated with higher CES‑D scores (r = 0.82); this indicates a relatively high predisposition to anxious responding that is an important risk correlate for depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) is lower than the sample mean and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in the population (r = -0.71), which also points toward increased vulnerability. By contrast, current self-reported happiness (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and perceived health satisfaction (5.89, Z = 1.22) are well above average and are moderately negatively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.47 and -0.40 respectively), suggesting important protective subjective wellbeing resources. Perceived stress is lower than average (PSS Z = -0.98), which again would reduce the likelihood of marked depressive symptom burden. Overall, self-report contains both risk signals (trait anxiety, relatively lower self‑esteem) and protective signals (higher momentary happiness, lower stress, good health satisfaction).

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns:
Daily activities and social behaviors are relatively sparse. The participant reports very low exercise (both alone and with others rated “Not at all”, with Z-scores near -1.9 and -1.6), limited socializing (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41), minimal recreational internet use, and little substance use. Low physical activity is weakly associated with higher CES‑D in this sample (small negative correlations), so the lack of exercise is a modest risk factor. Social engagement and substance use patterns do not show strong CES‑D associations here; limited social time could be mildly unfavorable but correlations with CES‑D are near zero. Overall, lifestyle data suggest limited behavioral activation, which can contribute to vulnerability when combined with other risk factors.

Sleep, circadian, and physiological signals:
Wearable-derived signals show several noteworthy features. Nighttime sleep is relatively short (median 6 h 10 min; Z = -1.27) and bedtimes are late and variable (median sleep start ~01:28, start-time SD ≈ 101 minutes), indicating restricted and irregular sleep timing. Sleep duration has little direct correlation with CES‑D in the provided correlations, but short and variable sleep is commonly relevant to mood regulation and represents a potential risk domain here. Circadian stability metrics are generally intact: interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z = 0.33), intradaily variability is relatively low (Z = -0.74), and autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (Z = 0.73), which together point to a reasonably regular, consolidated daily rhythm — a factor that is typically protective. Physiologically, average heart-rate measures are modestly elevated (Mesor = 83.24, Z = 1.27; resting HR = 63.4, Z = 0.62), and these heart-rate elevations have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting a mild signal of greater autonomic arousal. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show a normal nocturnal trough and daytime rise without clear circadian disruption.

Evidence weighing for CES‑D placement:
Evidence consistent with a higher CES‑D score (top half) includes moderately elevated trait anxiety (strongly predictive in this population), lower-than-average self‑esteem (strong negative correlate), short and somewhat irregular sleep, and mildly elevated heart-rate indices. Evidence consistent with a lower/median CES‑D score (bottom half) includes high current happiness, low perceived stress, good health satisfaction, and preserved circadian stability/low intradaily fragmentation — all of which are associated with lower CES‑D scores in this dataset. The strongest single population-level predictor in the dataset is trait anxiety (r = 0.82) and self‑esteem (r = -0.71); both of these point toward higher CES‑D risk for this participant, whereas the protective markers (happiness, low stress) are moderate in strength but do not fully counterbalance the two strongest risk correlates.

Holistic conclusion:
Balancing the available multimodal information, the participant presents a mixed profile but with key risk indicators (notably trait anxiety and relatively lower self‑esteem) that are highly predictive of elevated CES‑D scores in this study population. Although several protective signals (high momentary happiness, low perceived stress, reasonable circadian regularity) argue against very high symptom burden, the weight of the strongest correlates suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the CES‑D distribution.

75438,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Psychological trait and symptom self-report: The participant reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 36, z = -0.52) and comparatively high self-esteem (RSES = 33, z = -0.73). Both measures have strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI r = 0.81; self-esteem r = -0.71), and their directions and magnitudes point toward fewer depressive symptoms than the study mean. Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS score = 18, z = -0.98) and current self-rated happiness is somewhat lower than average (happy = 3.0, z = -0.53), but these effects are modest relative to the stronger protective signals from low anxiety and higher self-esteem. Overall, the self-report profile tilts toward lower depressive symptom burden, with some mild negative signals (reduced momentary happiness, lower interpersonal trust) that may reflect transient or domain-specific distress but are not large in magnitude.

Behavioral lifestyle markers: The participant endorses frequent solitary exercise (3+ times/week, z = 1.07) and moderate social activity (socializing 2–3 hours, z = 0.95). These activity and social engagement indicators are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology; their correlations with CES-D in the dataset are small-to-moderate in the expected directions (exercise r ≈ -0.09 to -0.23). Alcohol use is moderate (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, z = 0.94) and non-prescribed drug use is reported as “not at all,” though recreational drug use frequency is low but relatively elevated vs peers (reported <1–2 times/month, z = 1.61). The participant reports minimal sedentary hobby time and limited daytime media/gaming use. Taken together, behavioral indices suggest active lifestyle and social contact that are protective against higher depressive symptoms, with only modest risk-related substance indicators.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep quality: Objective Fitbit-derived sleep shows a short median nightly duration (6 h 2 min, z = -1.43) and a late median sleep start (~01:43), with modest night-to-night variability (SD 94 min, z ≈ -0.15). Subjective sleep quality crosses the commonly used threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6) but is only slightly lower than the sample mean on z-score (z = -0.33). Napping is negligible. Short and late sleep timing can be risk factors for mood symptoms; however, in this dataset the correlation between objective sleep duration and CES-D is essentially null (r ≈ -0.01), and subjective sleep disturbance is only mildly elevated. Thus sleep-related data indicate a potential behavioral vulnerability (short/late sleep) but not one that is strongly tied to higher depressive scores within the sample.

Cardiovascular rhythm and circadian structure: Resting heart rate is relatively low (RHR = 53 bpm, z = -0.61), and cosinor-derived mesor is below the sample mean (mesor = 69.46, z = -0.61). Nonparametric circadian metrics indicate somewhat lower interdaily stability (0.33, z = -0.66) and reduced intradaily variability (0.39, z = -1.09). Hourly mean deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal heart rate dips (~-20 bpm around 3–5 AM) and large positive deviations across midday (peaking near +18 bpm around 12–3 PM; z-scores up to ~2.07). Overall, the participant exhibits a clear day–night cardiac rhythm with large daytime rises and strong nocturnal decreases; circadian regularity is modest but not markedly disrupted. Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac features in this case have low-to-negligible correlations with CES-D (most r values near zero), indicating limited predictive weight for depressive symptoms in this individual’s profile.

Integration and CES-D placement rationale: Multiple high-weight self-report indicators that correlate strongly with CES-D — notably low trait anxiety (STAI) and higher self-esteem — favor a relatively low depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. Behavioral and social indicators (regular exercise, frequent socializing) further support a lower-risk profile. The principal countervailing signals are short, late sleep and a PSQI score consistent with disturbed sleep, plus somewhat lower momentary happiness and interpersonal trust; these factors suggest localized vulnerabilities but are modest in magnitude and have weak or inconsistent correlations with CES-D in the sample. Wearable circadian and heart-rate metrics are generally normative or only mildly atypical and show minimal correlation with CES-D here. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence — especially the strong protective self-report traits and active lifestyle — is more consistent with a CES-D score at or below the population median rather than in the upper half of the distribution.

99733,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"Across self-report measures the participant presents a broadly low-risk profile for depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) is well below the study mean and the instrument’s correlation with CES‑D is large (r = 0.81), which—given the participant’s low anxiety score—argues against a high CES‑D score. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 33, Z = -0.73) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r = -0.71), another protective indicator. Perceived stress is below average (PSS Z = -0.98) and subjective sleep quality by PSQI is rated as good (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). Measures of health satisfaction and interpersonal trust are at or above average, and the participant reports no current use of alcohol or recreational/non‑prescribed drugs. Together these self‑report domains show multiple signals that typically associate with lower depressive symptom burden in this cohort.

Behavioral and social habit data show limited social and group exercise engagement but generally low time spent in sedentary leisure and screen-based activities. The participant exercises alone modestly (1–2 times/week) and exercises with others or participates in sports only rarely; socializing time is low (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41). Low social contact could be a relative vulnerability for mood in some contexts, but in this case it co-occurs with low reported stress, good self‑esteem, low anxiety, and no substance use—so its net contribution to depressive symptom risk appears limited. Academic performance (GPA series around 3.0) and normal BMI further provide contextual indicators of functioning that are not suggestive of marked impairment.

Wearable‑derived physiology and circadian metrics indicate a generally intact nocturnal heart‑rate nadir and daytime elevations but some signals of reduced circadian amplitude and greater within‑day fragmentation. Mesor (mean circadian heart rate) is slightly above the cohort mean (74.9 bpm, Z = 0.13) and resting heart rate is modestly elevated relative to peers (62.6 bpm, Z = 0.53); both have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.19). Amplitude from cosinor analysis is lower than average (9.44, Z = -0.43) and intradaily variability is higher than average (IV = 0.70, Z = 1.09), suggesting a blunted day–night contrast and more fragmented hourly activity/physiology across the day. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are near or below average, indicating only modest regularity in daily rhythms. Sleep recorded by the wearable shows median nightly sleep of ≈6 h 43 min (Z = -0.58) with moderate night‑to‑night variability; median sleep timing is around 00:38 with moderate variability. These wearable features (reduced amplitude, higher IV) are sometimes associated with depressive symptoms in the literature, but in this dataset their correlations with CES‑D are small or inconsistent and must be interpreted alongside the stronger protective trait and symptom reports.

Integrating modalities, the strongest and most consistent signals in this participant point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. High‑magnitude sample correlations highlight trait anxiety and self‑esteem as the most predictive survey markers of CES‑D in this cohort; the participant’s scores on both are protective (low anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem). Subjective sleep quality, perceived stress, health satisfaction, lack of substance use, and normative academic and BMI indicators further support lower risk. Physiological signals (slightly elevated resting HR, blunted circadian amplitude, higher intradaily variability) introduce modest concern for circadian/physiological dysregulation but their sample correlations with CES‑D are small and they contrast with the stronger protective self‑report profile. On balance—weighing the large, predictive survey markers and behavioral context more heavily than the modest wearable irregularities—the evidence indicates the participant’s CES‑D score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

27407,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"Self-report profile: The participant reports a pattern of elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) that is strongly associated with CES-D in the study sample (STAI–CES-D correlation = 0.82). Perceived stress is mildly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38), and subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52 classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""). At the same time the participant endorses reasonably high self-worth (Rosenberg Self-Esteem = 36, Z = -0.31), modest current happiness (self-rated = 4, Z = 0.55), good academic performance (GPAs in the high 3.7–3.94 range), and relatively low substance use. Taken together, the self-report pattern shows a mixture of notable risk signals for depressive symptoms (high trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, elevated stress) alongside protective signals (above-average self-esteem, academic functioning, low substance use).

Sleep and diurnal behavior (wearable + self-report): Wearable-derived sleep shows a late median sleep onset (02:02) with a shortened median nightly duration (6 h 14 min, Z = -1.17) and substantial night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 120 min, Z = 0.43). These objective sleep features align with the high PSQI and represent behavioral patterns that are commonly linked to higher depressive symptom burden. Napping is minimal. Overall circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate are near the study mean (interdaily stability 0.40, Z ≈ -0.08; intradaily variability 0.51, Z ≈ -0.25), indicating that while sleep timing is late and duration is short/variable, the participant retains a modestly structured 24-hour rhythm rather than extreme fragmentation.

Physiological and activity-derived signals: Resting heart rate is low (46.3 bpm, Z = -1.41), consistent with above-average cardiorespiratory fitness; the mesor of heart rate is also relatively low (65.18, Z = -1.2). The cosinor amplitude is somewhat elevated (amplitude Z = 0.47) and the acrophase is in the early evening (~5:46 PM). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show pronounced evening and late-night elevations (notably 7–9 pm and a positive deviation at midnight–1am) and large negative deviations in the early morning (3–6 am). The late-night elevated heart-rate deviations together with the very late sleep timing suggest evening physiological activation and a delayed sleep phase, which can co-occur with poor sleep and mood symptoms. Most wearable circadian metrics show small correlations with CES-D in this sample, but the physiologic signature supports the behavioral sleep findings.

Behavioral/social context: The participant reports moderate engagement in physical activity/sports (exercise and sports 1–2 times per week, sports Z = 0.91), low alcohol and drug use, and limited recreational passive behaviors (very little TV, little music listening). Social contact is somewhat reduced (socializing Z = -0.62). These characteristics provide some behavioral protection (exercise, low substance use, good academic functioning) but decreased socializing and low engagement with certain recreational activities may reduce typical social and pleasurable reinforcers.

Synthesis weighing evidence for depressive symptom burden: Evidence supporting relatively higher CES-D placement (top half) includes the strong indicator of chronic anxiety (STAI) which is highly correlated with CES-D in this population, poor subjective sleep (PSQI high), objectively late and short sleep with high intra-individual variability, elevated evening physiological activation, and modestly elevated perceived stress. Evidence favoring relatively lower CES-D (bottom half) includes above-average self-esteem, intact academic functioning, frequent sports/exercise, low substance use, low resting heart rate, and a modest level of current happiness. Because trait anxiety in this sample is a very strong statistical correlate of CES-D (correlation = 0.82) and both subjective and objective sleep indicators point toward disturbance and late timing (PSQI Z = 1.52; sleep onset ~02:00; median sleep duration Z = -1.17), the balance of risk versus protective features suggests a net tendency toward elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study population.

Final classification (relative to the study distribution): {""cesd_group"": ""top_50""}"
43794,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"Psychological symptom profile (self-report): The participant reports a cluster of affective and cognitive features that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is notably high (STAI = 55, Z = 1.35) and this measure has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study sample (r = 0.82), indicating that higher chronic anxiety proneness in this participant aligns with patterns linked to higher depressive scores. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), suggesting lower self-worth in this participant maps onto greater depressive symptom risk. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 26, Z = 1.19) and current self-reported happiness is below average (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53), both profiles that, together with the anxiety and self-esteem data, form a coherent signal of increased affective distress relative to peers.

Subjective sleep and daily routines: The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 8, classified as disturbed), and wearable sleep metrics show a median nightly duration close to normative levels (~6 h 59 m, Z = -0.24) but with large night-to-night variability (SD = 156 minutes, Z = 1.25) and a late median sleep onset (~01:03) with substantial timing variability (SD = 122 minutes, Z = 0.86). These features indicate relatively irregular sleep timing and inconsistent sleep duration—patterns that are associated with poorer mood and higher depressive symptom burden in the literature and are reflected here by small positive correlations between sleep variability and CES-D (r ≈ 0.2).

Circadian and autonomic physiology (wearable-derived): Heart rate circadian analysis shows reduced rhythm robustness and amplitude. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is low (value = 0.20, Z = -1.73) and cosinor amplitude is reduced (amplitude = 5.34, Z = -1.76), consistent with a flattened or less-regular daily physiological rhythm. Resting heart rate is elevated for the sample (RHR = 70.8 bpm, Z = 1.5) and mesor is modestly above average (mesor ≈ 76.9, Z = 0.41). Elevated resting HR and reduced circadian amplitude/stability are physiologically congruent with chronic stress and affective dysregulation; the resting heart rate has a modest positive correlation with CES-D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.20). The aggregated hourly deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime increases, but the overall low amplitude and low interdaily stability point to circadian irregularity rather than a strongly entrained rhythm.

Behavioral and social context: The participant engages in limited solitary exercise (1–2×/month) but reports exercising with others more frequently (1–2×/week), and academic performance is strong (GPA mostly high), which are potential protective or stabilizing factors. Alcohol use is moderate (wine 1–2×/week) and recreational/illegal drug use is negligible. Notably, the participant reports unusually high time listening to music (>4 hours; Z = 2.06), a behavior that in this dataset correlates modestly with CES-D (r ≈ 0.26) and may reflect a coping pattern or passive leisure. Socializing time is below average (Z ≈ -0.62). Overall, social and activity indicators are mixed: some adaptive elements (group exercise, strong GPA), but limited social engagement, elevated solitary leisure listening to music, and disturbed/irregular sleep patterns.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Several high-weight indicators in this multimodal profile converge toward higher depressive symptomatology relative to the study population. The strongest statistical signals are high trait anxiety (STAI) and low self-esteem, both of which have large correlations with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.82 and r = -0.71, respectively) and are present at clinically elevated relative levels for this participant. Elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, large night-to-night sleep variability, reduced circadian rhythm stability/amplitude, and elevated resting heart rate provide additional, concordant physiological and behavioral evidence that aligns with higher CES-D scores. Protective factors (good academic performance, some group exercise) are present but do not outweigh the multiple convergent risk indicators. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports that this participant’s depressive symptom burden would more likely place them in the higher half of the study distribution.

51437,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"The self-report profile is characterized by generally adaptive trait and behavioral indicators alongside some subjective sleep complaints. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 35, z = -0.62) is below the sample mean and the instrument’s correlation with CES-D is high (r ≈ 0.81), which favors lower depressive symptom burden for this individual. Global self-regard is relatively elevated (Self‑Esteem z ≈ +0.96; the self‑esteem → CES-D correlation is moderately large and negative, r ≈ -0.71), which also points toward less depressive symptomatology. Academic performance is strong and stable (GPAs ≈ 3.69–3.72), exercise frequency is high (exercising and sports several times per week; z-scores > +1), and substance use is low — all behavioral patterns associated in the literature with lower depressive symptoms. Current perceived stress is modest (PSS = 20, z ≈ -0.44) and current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (z ≈ -0.53), suggesting only mild momentary negative affect rather than pervasive high distress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics identify several physiological and behavioral patterns that can elevate risk for mood symptoms, although effect sizes and direct correlations with CES‑D are modest. Objective sleep is shorter than the sample average (median 6 h 15 min, z ≈ -1.16) and the PSQI score is just above the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6). The participant has a very late median sleep onset (≈ 02:14 AM) with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time. Heart rate–based circadian measures show a higher mesor and an elevated resting heart rate (RHR = 73 bpm, z ≈ +1.77), together with a reduced amplitude (dampened day–night difference, amplitude z ≈ -1.59), lower interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.82), and higher intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.51). The aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced relative heart rate elevations late at night (notably around midnight–1 AM), consistent with late-night physiological arousal or activity. These physiological signatures (short sleep, late phase, nocturnal arousal, elevated RHR, and dampened circadian amplitude) have been associated in prior work with higher depressive symptoms, but in this dataset their correlations with CES‑D are generally small to moderate (e.g., RHR and mesor r ≈ +0.2; many hourly deviations and nonparametric rhythm metrics show weak associations).

Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most CES‑D‑relevant indicators in this case favor lower depressive symptom burden. Trait measures with large correlations to CES‑D (low STAI, relatively high self‑esteem) and robust behavioral protective factors (regular exercise, low substance use, strong academic performance, reasonable health satisfaction) provide substantial evidence for placement below the sample median of depressive symptoms. Physiological signals and objective sleep parameters (short sleep, late timing, elevated resting HR, blunted circadian amplitude) represent notable risk features but their associations with CES‑D in the available summary metrics are weaker and may reflect chronotype and lifestyle (late sleep schedule, late-night activity) rather than pervasive depressive symptomatology. On balance, the preponderance of strong trait- and behavior-based indicators that are inversely related to CES‑D outweighs the modest physiological risk markers.

21932,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures collectively indicate relatively low internalizing symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) is well below the sample mean; given a strong positive correlation between STAI and CES‑D in this cohort (r ≈ 0.81), this low anxiety score is a robust indicator favoring lower depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.66), and because self‑esteem is negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), this provides additional evidence consistent with lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is markedly low (PSS Z = -2.34), which—given its modest positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.28)—also argues for lower depressive symptom burden. One area of subjective concern is sleep quality: the PSQI score of 8 (Z = 0.59) classifies as disturbed sleep and would usually be associated with higher depressive symptom reports, but this single elevated sleep-disturbance score must be weighed against other protective signals described below. Self‑reported current happiness and interpersonal trust are slightly below sample average (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; trust Z ≈ -0.46), which are modest negative signals but small in magnitude relative to the strong protective indicators.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns:
Behavioral habits are generally health‑oriented and consistent with low risk for depression in this sample. Alcohol and drug use are minimal (infrequent beer/wine, no recreational or non‑prescribed drugs). Physical activity occurs but is modest in frequency (exercising alone and with others ~1–2 times/week), and social activity is below average (socializing Z ≈ -0.62) though correlations with CES‑D for these specific recreational measures are small. Academic performance (GPAs) is high. Health satisfaction is above average (Z ≈ 0.55). Overall, the lifestyle profile presents more protective than risk factors with respect to depressive symptoms.

Objective sleep, circadian structure, and wearable‑derived physiology:
Fitbit‑derived sleep metrics indicate objectively long, regular nocturnal sleep: median sleep duration ≈ 8 h 14 min (Z = 1.31) with relatively low night‑to‑night variability (duration SD Z = -1.15) and moderately consistent sleep onset times (median start ~00:38, start SD Z = -0.61). These objective sleep markers—long and regular sleep—are generally inconsistent with the PSQI‑reported disturbed sleep and may reflect a subjective–objective divergence (subjective complaints despite adequate objective duration). Circadian rhythm features derived from heart rate show moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.67) and somewhat elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.95). Mesor and resting heart rate are slightly below the cohort mean (mesor Z ≈ -0.58; resting HR 54.1 bpm, Z ≈ -0.48), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and not strongly associated with higher CES‑D in this sample. Amplitude is modestly above average (Z ≈ 0.44) and acrophase is in the late afternoon/evening (~5:20 PM), indicating a typical diurnal heart‑rate rhythm.

Patterns of physiological arousal across the day:
Aggregated hourly deviations from mesor reveal expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate and daytime elevations. Two notable peaks relative to the participant’s mesor appear: a large midday peak (12–2 pm; particularly 12–1 pm Z = 2.59, 1–2 pm Z = 2.11) and an unusually large elevation at 10–11 pm (value Z = 3.14). These elevated hourly deviations suggest periods of increased physiological activation in the early afternoon and an evening period of elevated heart rate relative to the person’s mean. However, correlations between these hourly deviations and CES‑D scores in the cohort are negligible to small, so while these peaks are salient physiologically, they have limited direct implication for depressive symptomatology in this dataset.

Integrative interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the balance favors relatively low depressive symptom burden. Strong protective indicators include notably low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, and very low perceived stress—three measures that are both individually salient and, in this sample, strongly associated with CES‑D scores. Objective wearable data (regular, long sleep; low resting heart rate; reasonable circadian stability) further support lower risk. Areas that might temper confidence are the PSQI indicating subjective sleep disturbance, slightly below‑average self‑reported happiness and socializing, and an evening heart rate elevation; these are nontrivial but smaller in magnitude or weakly related to CES‑D in the cohort. On balance—considering effect sizes, z‑scores, and the reported correlations—the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant’s CES‑D score would be more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution.

36385,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but concerning profile for affective symptoms. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76), and relatively low global self-esteem (RSES = 31; Z = -1.01). These two measures have strong associations with CES-D in the study sample (STAI–trait correlation with CES-D = 0.81; self-esteem correlation = -0.71), which makes them particularly informative for depressive symptom burden. Current self-rated happiness is slightly above average (4.0; Z = 0.55), and perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 22; Z = 0.10), suggesting that momentary positive affect and stress appraisal are not markedly deviant even as trait vulnerability (anxiety, low self-esteem) is elevated.

Objective and derived cardiac rhythm metrics show modest departures from the sample mean consistent with mild physiological arousal and largely preserved circadian structure. Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated (64.05 bpm; Z = 0.70) and the MESOR of heart rate is slightly above average (MESOR = 76.96; Z = 0.41). Circadian rhythm summary features (interdaily stability = 0.44, intradaily variability = 0.56, autocorrelation24h = 0.35) fall close to sample norms (Z-scores ≈ 0.1–0.25), and amplitude is average, while acrophase (~5:23 PM) indicates a typical evening timing of peak heart rate. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate and afternoon/evening elevations; there is no clear large-scale breakdown of 24-hour rhythmicity, though small positive correlations of some sleep timing variability measures with CES-D suggest that irregularity contributes modestly to symptom burden in this sample.

Sleep behavior presents a notable contrast between long average sleep duration and subjective disturbance. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep is long (8 h 47 min; Z = 2.0), with high night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 133 min; Z = 0.73) and sleep start time (SD ≈ 140 min; Z = 1.26). Self-reported sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 6). The combination of objectively prolonged sleep duration with high variability and subjective poor sleep is a pattern that can be observed in populations with elevated depressive symptoms (hypersomnia and irregular sleep timing), and sleep variability shows a small positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (sleep SD Z-score correlations ≈ 0.19–0.21).

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are mixed and generally not strongly suggestive of severe functional impairment. The participant reports regular but moderate solitary exercise (1–2×/week) and socializing (1–2 hours/day; Z ≈ 0.16). Alcohol use is modest (beer monthly, wine/liquor 1–2×/week) and recreational drug use is absent. High engagement with listening to music (2–3 hours; Z = 1.13) may reflect a solitary coping behavior but is not by itself a marker of depressive severity. Academic performance is high (GPAs 3.52–4.0), which suggests preserved cognitive/academic functioning during the recording period.

Weighing evidence for likely CES-D group membership: strong indicators pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms include elevated trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES-D), low self-esteem (strong negative correlate), disturbed subjective sleep, long and irregular objective sleep, and mildly elevated resting heart rate. Countervailing evidence includes moderate self-reported happiness, average perceived stress, preserved circadian amplitude and stability, active academic functioning, and engagement in some social and physical activities. Given the particularly strong predictive relationships of STAI and self-esteem with CES-D in this sample (correlations 0.81 and -0.71, respectively), and the participant’s elevated anxiety and low self-esteem z-scores, the preponderance of multimodal evidence points toward relatively elevated depressive symptom burden compared with the overall study population. On balance, the participant is more consistent with being in the higher half of the CES-D distribution.

54030,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures describe a participant with generally low self-reported anxiety proneness (STAI = 27, Z = -1.41, classified “not anxious”), relatively high self-regard (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 1.52; large negative correlation with CES‑D, r = -0.71), and elevated momentary well-being (self-reported happiness Z = 1.64, r = -0.46). Perceived stress is modestly above average for the sample (PSS score 24, Z = 0.65, r = 0.29), and global health satisfaction is somewhat above average (Z = 0.72, r = -0.39). Behavioral self-reports show limited substance use, regular social contact (socializing 2–3 hours/day, Z = 0.95), and modest engagement in organized physical activity (sports/exercise with others 1–2×/week). Taken together, the survey profile contains multiple features associated with lower depressive symptom burden—especially high self-esteem and reported happiness—offset to a small degree by elevated perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features indicate reduced regularity and a relatively blunted daily cardiac rhythm. Non-parametric circadian measures show low interdaily stability (0.28, Z = -1.07) and markedly elevated intradaily variability (0.88, Z = 2.36), suggesting day-to-day irregularity and within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology. Parametric circadian features are consistent with this: amplitude is reduced (6.78, Z = -1.29) while MESOR is modestly below average (68.6, Z = -0.73). Resting heart rate is within the sample average (58.4 bpm, Z = 0.03). The hourly aggregate deviations from mesor show expected deep nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, with a relative late-evening elevation (e.g., a pronounced deviation at 10–11 pm, 14.19, Z = 1.22). These cardiac/circadian features point to attenuated amplitude and irregular timing of physiological rhythms—patterns that, in prior work, are associated with greater depressive symptoms, although correlations in this dataset are generally small.

Objective sleep metrics indicate a short and irregular sleep pattern with a pronounced delayed timing. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 18 min (Z = -1.09), and night-to-night variability is high (SD = 143 minutes, Z = 0.96). Median sleep start time is late (approximately 02:56 AM) with moderate variability (start-time SD 88 minutes, Z = 0.11). Mean daily naps are slightly elevated (0.22/day, Z = 1.75). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) is at the boundary typically considered “good,” suggesting the participant does not report substantial perceived sleep disturbance despite objectively short, irregular, and late sleep. These objective–subjective discrepancies and the delayed/variable sleep pattern represent behavioral features that can increase vulnerability to mood disturbance, though the dataset shows only small positive correlations between some sleep irregularity measures and CES‑D.

Integrative interpretation weighing survey and wearable data: survey indicators strongly favor lower depressive symptom burden—particularly the low trait anxiety and high self-esteem and happiness scores, which have relatively large associations with CES‑D in this sample (e.g., self‑esteem r = -0.71; STAI r = 0.81). Wearable-derived circadian and sleep markers reveal notable irregularity, fragmentation, and delayed timing—features that can elevate mood risk but here show only modest correlations with CES‑D in the cohort. Behavioral context (regular socializing, low substance use, some group exercise) further supports resilience. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (strong protective self-report indicators, modest risk from objective circadian/sleep measures, low anxiety) points toward a CES‑D score that is at or below the median of the study population rather than in the upper half.

34062,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Self-report measures indicate a generally favorable psychological profile with some areas of strain. The participant reports high self-esteem (Rosenberg z = +1.38) and elevated current happiness (z = +1.64), both of which are negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample and point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety is below the sample mean (STAI = 36, z = -0.52) despite a moderately elevated perceived stress score (PSS = 26, z = +1.19). Subjective health satisfaction is high (z = +1.8). In contrast, subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 10, z = +1.52), a metric commonly associated with depressive symptoms; this contributes a negative signal but must be interpreted alongside other measures.

Objective sleep and daily-rest patterns from the wearable present a mixed picture. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours and 6 minutes (z ≈ -0.11), within a typical range for the population, and mean daily naps are rare (0.14/day). Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is modest (sleep start SD ≈ 95 min, duration SD ≈ 80 min), which is not extreme. Thus, although the participant reports disturbed sleep subjectively, wearable-derived duration and nap behavior do not show substantial sleep loss or excessive daytime napping that often accompany higher depressive symptomatology.

Cardiovascular circadian metrics indicate a low overall heart-rate mesor and low resting heart rate (mesor 58.7 bpm, z = -2.08; resting HR 45.7 bpm, z = -1.48), suggesting generally low baseline physiological arousal. The cosinor amplitude is slightly below average and interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are reduced (interdaily stability z ≈ -0.41; autocorrelation z ≈ -0.87), implying somewhat weaker day-to-day regularity in heart-rate rhythms. Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and substantial daytime peaks (notably large positive deviations in late afternoon/early evening hours, e.g., 5–7pm), reflecting preserved diurnal mobilization rather than a flattened or blunted rhythm. Overall, the wearable physiology does not show a pattern of elevated tonic arousal or severely disrupted circadian structure that would strongly indicate elevated depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators align with adaptive functioning on several dimensions that are typically protective. The participant exercises frequently (exercising alone and with others three or more times per week), engages in moderate socializing (1–2 hours), has low recreational and non-prescribed drug use, and maintains good academic performance (GPAs generally above 3.4). These patterns (regular exercise, social contact, low substance use, sustained academic performance) are generally associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in young adult samples.

Holistic integration and likelihood estimate: weighing the different data streams, the strongest indicators point toward relatively low-to-average depressive symptom burden. Prominent protective signals include high self-esteem, elevated happiness, low trait anxiety, frequent exercise, social engagement, low substance use, and objective sleep duration within normal range. Countervailing signals are elevated perceived stress and poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI), and some reduction in circadian regularity, but these are moderate in magnitude and their correlations with CES-D in this sample are weaker than the correlations for self-esteem and trait anxiety. Wearable cardiac measures (low mesor and resting HR) are associated in this dataset with lower rather than higher CES-D. On balance, the multimodal evidence is more consistent with a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

18111,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but concerning profile with respect to depressive symptom correlates. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66) and the instrument’s score shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), which is a robust indicator that this participant’s anxiety-prone disposition is likely to co-occur with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also notably high (PSS = 28, Z = 1.74; r with CES-D = 0.28), consistent with increased risk for elevated CES-D scores. Subjective happiness is low (Current = 2.0, Z = -1.61; r = -0.46), another self-report item that aligns with higher depressive symptomatology. By contrast, self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31; r = -0.71), which would typically be protective against depressive symptoms. Taken together, the self-report battery presents both risk indicators (high anxiety, high stress, low happiness, disturbed sleep) and at least one protective signal (relatively preserved self-esteem), with the strongest statistical connector to CES-D being the elevated trait anxiety.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics suggest reduced circadian robustness and atypical hourly arousal patterns. Non-parametric circadian stability is low (interdaily stability = 0.24, Z = -1.4) and heart rate amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (amplitude = 6.21, Z = -1.48), both consistent with blunted or less-regular physiological rhythms. While correlations between these specific circadian metrics and CES-D are small in this sample (e.g., amplitude r = -0.09, interdaily stability r = 0.00), the pattern of reduced rhythmicity is often observed in populations with elevated mood symptoms and aligns conceptually with the participant’s disturbed sleep report. The participant’s resting heart rate is unremarkable (58.2 bpm, Z ≈ 0.01).

Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nighttime troughs and daytime/evening increases, but with relatively pronounced evening arousal: the largest positive deviations from mesor occur in the late evening (e.g., 8–9pm = +20.14, Z = 1.85; 9–10pm = +14.97, Z = 1.21). Mid-morning peaks are also present (9–10am = +10.82, Z = 1.04). Some afternoon hours show below-mesor values (e.g., 2–3pm = -4.74, Z = -2.17). Correlations between these hourly deviations and CES-D are small and generally negative for the evening peaks (e.g., r ≈ -0.14 at 8–9pm), indicating that in this sample higher evening heart-rate elevations are weakly associated with lower CES-D; however, those correlations are small and should be interpreted cautiously. Overall, the wearable heart-rate profile is characterized by reduced circadian amplitude and pockets of elevated evening physiological arousal, which, when combined with subjective sleep disturbance, is consistent with disrupted sleep–wake physiology rather than a clearly protective pattern.

Sleep measures present a mixed picture: median nightly sleep duration is within a typical range (7 h 16 m, Z = 0.1), but subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed, Z = 0.59), and napping behavior is elevated relative to peers (mean daily naps = 0.27, Z = 2.27; r with CES-D = 0.20). Sleep timing is late on average (median sleep start ~01:19), and night-to-night variability in duration is moderately elevated (SD = 113 minutes, Z = 0.27). The combination of disturbed subjective sleep, late and variable bedtimes, and higher-than-average napping is a pattern often associated with elevated depressive symptoms in student samples.

Lifestyle and social-behavioral indicators are heterogeneous. Alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2x/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and recreational drug use is absent. Physical activity is limited to light levels (exercising alone or with others 1–2x/week; sports not at all). Time use shows greater-than-average internet use (2–3 hours, Z = 0.85) and modest socializing (1–2 hours, Z = 0.16). These behaviors do not provide strong directional signals with respect to depression in this dataset (many correlations small), but lower structured activity and modest social engagement combined with high screen time and low sports participation are consistent with profiles frequently seen with higher symptom burden.

Holistic assessment and ranking: weighing the multiple data streams, several relatively strong and convergent indicators favor elevated depressive symptom burden. The most influential single indicator is elevated trait anxiety (STAI) which has a high correlation with CES-D in this population (r = 0.81) and is itself elevated for this participant. High perceived stress, low self-reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, increased napping, and reduced circadian amplitude/interdaily stability further support an interpretation of greater depressive symptom risk. The principal protective signal is relatively high self-esteem, which tempers but does not outweigh the convergent risk indicators. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports membership in the upper half of the CES-D distribution for this study sample.

59097,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"The self-report profile indicates several subjective signals commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 47, z = 0.56) and strongly positively correlated with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), indicating a notable propensity toward anxious affect that typically co-occurs with higher depression scores. Self-esteem is modestly lower than the sample average (RSES = 36, z = -0.31) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), supporting the interpretation that lower self-regard could be contributing to greater depressive symptom burden. Current self-rated happiness is substantially below the sample mean (score = 2.0, z = -1.61) and correlates negatively with CES-D (r = -0.46), again pointing toward elevated subjective distress. The PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score = 8, z = 0.59), which—although not uniquely diagnostic—commonly co-occurs with and can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle data provide mixed context. The participant reports frequent socializing (2–3 hours daily, z = 0.95) and good academic functioning (GPAs ~3.6–3.7), which are typically protective factors against high depressive symptom burden. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine 1–2 times/week; z ≈ 1.0) while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent; exercise frequency is relatively low (exercising alone or with others 1–2 times/month), which may reduce a behavioral buffer against low mood. Perceived stress is not unusually high relative to the sample (PSS score 20, z = -0.44), and overall health satisfaction is near average (z ≈ 0.05). These behavioral indicators therefore present both protective (social engagement, academic success) and vulnerability (low exercise, moderate alcohol use) elements.

Objective wearable-derived sleep and circadian/physiological metrics generally indicate preserved circadian structure and adequate sleep quantity but do not entirely align with the participant’s subjective sleep complaints. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 23 min, z = 1.5) and sleep timing is consistently late but stable (median sleep start ~01:07, low SD, z = -0.99), with no recorded naps. Circadian summary metrics from heart rate show high interdaily stability (z = 1.33), low intradaily variability (z = -1.52), a relatively large amplitude (z = 1.28), and a mesor modestly above average (z = 0.78), together suggesting a robust, regular daily rhythm and limited fragmentation. Resting heart rate is typical for the sample (≈59 bpm, z = 0.05). Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir and daytime elevations; correlations between these wearable features and CES-D are small. In sum, objective physiology and sleep quantity are more consistent with preserved circadian functioning than with severe behavioral disruption.

Integrative interpretation: subjective symptom measures (notably elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, low self-reported happiness, and disturbed sleep quality) collectively provide multiple, moderately to strongly weighted indicators that align with higher depressive symptom burden as measured by CES-D in this sample. Wearable data moderate this picture by indicating adequate sleep quantity and stable circadian organization, which argue against severe behavioral or physiological dysregulation. On balance—given the strong correlations between STAI/self-esteem and CES-D in the population and the participant’s profile of elevated anxiety and low happiness—the evidence favors placement in the upper half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

24833,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"Self-report psychological profile and affective indicators:
The participant’s self-report battery shows several favorable signals relative to the study population. Trait anxiety on the STAI is low (score 33; z ≈ -0.82), which in this sample is strongly correlated with CES‑D scores (r ≈ 0.81); a low STAI therefore provides a robust indication of lower depressive symptom burden. Self‑esteem is reported as relatively high (z ≈ 0.82; note the raw value appears inconsistent with the scale range but the z‑score and its correlation with CES‑D [r ≈ -0.71] both indicate comparatively higher self‑esteem), which is a strong protective correlate. Perceived stress is modest (PSS = 20; z ≈ -0.44) and overall health satisfaction is above average (z ≈ 0.8), both of which point away from marked depressive symptomatology. Subjective happiness is somewhat lower than average (z ≈ -0.53) and PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score = 7), which are risk-related signals, but these are smaller in magnitude and/or less strongly correlated with CES‑D than the low anxiety and high self‑esteem signals.

Sleep behavior and circadian physiology (wearable + self‑report):
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian features reveal mixed findings. Median nightly sleep duration is just under 7 hours (6 h 55 m; z ≈ -0.32), with moderate night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 98 minutes). The median sleep start time is late (≈ 02:10 AM), and PSQI indicates subjective sleep disturbance; together these suggest delayed and somewhat fragmented sleep. Circadian summary metrics show low interdaily stability (value 0.17; z ≈ -1.98) and low rhythmic amplitude (z ≈ -1.58), indicating weak, less regular day‑to‑day structure in heart‑rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (z ≈ 0.46), consistent with some fragmentation of daily patterns. Although these circadian and sleep irregularities are features that have been associated with depressive symptoms in prior work, in this dataset their measured correlations with CES‑D are small to negligible (correlations near 0 to -0.15 for most circadian metrics), so they constitute moderate risk signals but not decisive ones for this participant.

Physiological arousal and hourly heart‑rate patterning:
Resting heart rate is mildly elevated relative to the sample (64.7 bpm; z ≈ 0.78) and has a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting a slight physiological arousal signal that could be concordant with affective symptoms. Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor show an expected nocturnal trough and daytime elevations, with the MESOR slightly above average (z ≈ 0.4) and the acrophase near early evening (≈ 5:40 PM). There are no extreme or atypical hourly departures that would strongly implicate elevated depressive symptomatology beyond the modestly elevated resting HR and low amplitude/instability noted above.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
The participant reports regular moderate social and physical activity (exercise and socializing ~1–2 times per week; sports participation reported), low recreational drug use, and moderate alcohol use (1–2 times per week). These behavioral patterns are generally neutral to protective with respect to depressive symptoms in the study sample (correlations with CES‑D are small or negative). Academic performance (GPAs ~3.3–3.4) and health satisfaction are also consistent with functioning that does not suggest a high symptom burden.

Holistic interpretation and CES‑D group assignment:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most discriminating signals in this dataset point toward lower depressive symptom burden: notably low trait anxiety (strong positive predictor when high), relatively high self‑esteem (strong negative predictor when high), above‑average health satisfaction, and active engagement in social/physical behaviors. Countervailing indications—disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, low circadian stability and amplitude, and a mildly elevated resting heart rate—are present but either modest in magnitude or have weak correlations with CES‑D in this sample. Taken holistically, protective and low‑symptom indicators predominate over the moderate risk indicators, making it more likely that this participant’s CES‑D score falls at or below the median of the study population.

84502,18.0,0.7461139896373057,"Psychological trait and self-report profile: The participant’s self-report data indicate a generally adaptive trait profile with some symptomatic signals. Trait anxiety (STAI = 38; z = -0.33) is below the study mean and is classified as “not anxious,” which—given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.82)—is a protective indicator with respect to depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is relatively elevated (RSES z ≈ 0.4; sample correlation with CES-D ≈ -0.71), which also points away from elevated depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is modestly above average (PSS z ≈ 0.38; small positive correlation with CES-D), and current self-rated happiness is below average (z ≈ -0.53; moderate negative correlation with CES-D), indicating some momentary affective distress. Trust in others and health satisfaction are both above average (z ≈ 0.8 and 0.72 respectively) and correlate negatively with CES-D, which further supports lower depressive symptomatology on trait and social-resource dimensions. Behavioral risk factors such as substance and non-prescribed drug use are absent, and the participant reports frequent group-based exercise (≥3x/week; z ≈ 1.23), a behavior that is associated with lower CES-D scores in this sample.

Sleep and subjective sleep quality: Objective sleep timing and quantity from the wearable are broadly normative. Median sleep duration ~7 h 31 m (z ≈ 0.41) with no reported daily naps and modest night-to-night variability; median sleep onset is shortly after midnight (00:20) with a moderate SD of ~65 minutes. Despite these objectively adequate metrics, subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 10; z ≈ 1.52, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”). The divergence between normal objective duration and elevated subjective sleep disturbance suggests the participant perceives sleep problems (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep, or other complaints) even though wearable-derived duration and regularity are not markedly abnormal. Because poor subjective sleep often associates with higher depressive symptoms, this discrepancy is a focal point of concern, but it should be weighted alongside the otherwise normative objective sleep and activity data.

Circadian and physiological activity: Heart rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a well-structured and regular daily profile. Interdaily stability (value 0.55; z ≈ 1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 h (z ≈ 0.81) are above average, and intradaily variability is close to sample mean, together implying consistent day-to-day timing of activity and physiological state. Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than average (resting HR ≈ 52.6 bpm, MESOR z ≈ -0.94), and amplitude is modestly above average (z ≈ 0.53), with an acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:08 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and pronounced late-afternoon peaks (largest positive deviation 4–6 PM). These objective markers collectively reflect physiological regularity and relatively low tonic autonomic arousal—patterns that, in this sample, are more typical of lower rather than higher CES-D scores (correlations between many circadian features and CES-D are small in magnitude and mixed in sign).

Synthesis regarding depressive symptom burden: Integrating self-report, behavioral, and wearable signals yields a mixed but overall more protective profile with respect to depressive symptoms. Strong protective indicators include low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, frequent social exercise, absence of substance use, above-average interpersonal trust and health satisfaction, consistent circadian rhythms, and a relatively low resting heart rate. Signals that could point to elevated depressive symptoms are limited to poorer subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10) and somewhat lower momentary happiness, plus a modestly elevated perceived stress score. However, many of the strongest sample-level correlates of CES-D (notably trait anxiety and self-esteem) are favorable for this participant, and objective sleep and activity measures do not show dysregulation that typically aligns with higher CES-D burden. On balance, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s CES-D score would be more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

78783,13.0,0.5777202072538861,"Summary of self-report psychological characteristics and symptom-relevant measures:
The participant reports a mix of risk and protective psychological characteristics. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z ≈ 0.17) is mildly elevated relative to the sample and is a construct that, in this dataset, correlates strongly with depressive symptoms (STAI–CES-D r ≈ 0.81), suggesting anxiety-proneness may contribute to affective symptom burden. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11) and, in this population, has a strong negative association with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), indicating a robust protective factor against depressive symptomatology. Current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z ≈ -1.61) and shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.46), pointing to reduced momentary positive affect that would be expected to co-occur with higher depressive symptom reports. Perceived stress is near sample average (PSS = 21, Z ≈ -0.17), so stress exposure alone does not strongly distinguish this individual from peers in this dataset. Overall, the self-report profile indicates both meaningful protective resources (high self-esteem, moderate social engagement) and symptom signals (elevated anxiety proneness, low current happiness) relevant to depressive symptom burden.

Sleep behavior and circadian/physiological indicators:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures show irregular and late sleep timing with moderate sleep quantity. Median nightly sleep duration is just under seven hours (6 h 52 m; Z ≈ -0.39), while night-to-night variability in duration is high (SD ≈ 151 minutes, Z ≈ 1.13). The median sleep start time is very late (≈ 02:51), and sleep start time variability is markedly elevated (SD ≈ 173 minutes, Z ≈ 1.99). The participant takes naps more often than most peers (mean daily naps 0.26; Z ≈ 2.23). These features (irregular and late sleep timing, high variability, more naps) have modest positive correlations with CES-D in the dataset (sleep variability and nap frequency r ≈ 0.2–0.22), suggesting that their sleep irregularity and fragmentation are potential behavioral contributors to increased depressive symptoms. Circadian heart-rate measures show moderate amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ 0.49) and a mesor and resting heart rate that are lower than the sample average (mesor Z ≈ -0.58; resting HR Z ≈ -0.64), indicating relatively low baseline cardiovascular tone with preserved day–night modulation. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z ≈ 0.24) while interdaily stability is somewhat reduced (Z ≈ -0.41), consistent with irregular daily structure. Taken together, the sleep/circadian profile suggests circadian irregularity and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) that are more typical of individuals with elevated depressive symptoms, even though overall sleep quantity is only modestly reduced.

Behavioral lifestyle, social, and health-related indicators:
Behavioral data indicate several health-promoting practices and social engagement that typically relate to lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.07; additional sports and social exercise weekly) and relatively high social time with friends (2–3 hours, Z ≈ 0.95). Substance use is minimal (alcohol only 1–2 times/month; no recreational or non-prescribed drug use). Body mass index is elevated (BMI ≈ 28.8). Health satisfaction is relatively low (score ≈ 2.78, Z ≈ -1.11) and correlates negatively with CES-D (r ≈ -0.39), indicating poorer perceived health may co-occur with higher depressive symptoms. Leisure patterns include above-average time on video games and some solitary recreational screen time; however, the participant’s substantial exercise and social activity are notable protective behavioral factors in the context of mood.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
Balancing risk and protective indicators yields a mixed but interpretable picture. Risk signals for elevated depressive symptoms include low current happiness, elevated trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8), pronounced irregularity and lateness in sleep timing, and reduced health satisfaction; several of these variables (trait anxiety, happiness, sleep variability) have moderate correlations with CES-D in the study sample. Countervailing protective signals include very high self-esteem (a strong negative correlate of CES-D in this dataset), frequent exercise, and substantive social engagement; substance use is low. Physiological data (lower resting HR, preserved amplitude) do not show strong adverse signals for depressive burden and may reflect fitness or lower sympathetic tone rather than mood pathology. On balance, the most powerful statistical relationship in the available data is between self-esteem and CES-D, and this participant’s self-esteem score is near the top of the scale, which weighs substantially toward lower depressive symptom burden. The presence of sleep irregularity and low momentary happiness argue for some elevated symptom indicators but are not, in magnitude, as compelling as the protective factors recorded.

Overall ranking relative to the study population:
Considering the totality of self-report, behavioral, and wearable indicators — especially the combination of high self-esteem, regular exercise, and active social engagement versus only modestly elevated anxiety and clear sleep irregularity — the preponderance of evidence suggests the participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not in the top 50% for depressive symptom burden). {""cesd_group"": ""bottom_50""}"

The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) is notably above the sample mean and this scale shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the cohort (r ≈ 0.82), indicating that their anxiety proneness is a robust risk correlate. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92), and self-reported current happiness is below average (Happy = 3.0, Z = −0.53), both of which align with higher depressive symptoms in the study correlations (happy r ≈ −0.46). The PSQI score (7) exceeds common clinical cutoffs for poor sleep quality and, although its Z-score is near the mean (Z = 0.13), it provides additional subjective evidence of sleep-related difficulties that often accompany depressive symptomatology.

Objective wearable-derived sleep and circadian data present a mixed picture. Nighttime sleep duration is relatively short (median 6 h 34 m, Z = −0.77) and sleep onset is late on average (median start ≈ 01:45), patterns that are commonly associated with mood disturbance. However, sleep timing and duration show low-to-moderate night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 61 minutes, Z = −0.91; sleep start SD = 56 minutes, Z = −0.58), which can be protective compared with highly irregular sleepers. Circadian heart-rate metrics likewise show some protective features: the participant’s heart-rate-based amplitude is elevated (Amplitude Z = 0.64) and intradaily variability is lower than average (IV Z = −0.53), consistent with a relatively consolidated daily rhythm. Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than the study mean (RHR Z ≈ −0.68; MESOR Z ≈ −0.85), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic physiological arousal—factors that are typically linked to better affective health.

Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced daytime elevation, most notably an extreme positive deviation in the 3–4 PM hour (value = +38.33 bpm, Z = 5.3). This large afternoon peak substantially contributes to overall amplitude and may reflect periods of intense activity (e.g., exercise, classes) on many days rather than persistent physiological hyperarousal. The nocturnal hours show expected negative deviations from mesor. Correlations between most hourly deviations and CES-D are small in magnitude, suggesting these specific hourly patterns do not strongly track with depressive symptoms in the broader sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are heterogeneous. The participant reports moderate alcohol use (beer and liquor 1–2×/week) and infrequent recreational drug use, moderate frequency of exercise (generally 1–2×/week), and limited daily socializing (social time Z ≈ −0.62). Self-reported health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 1.63), a robust negative correlate of CES-D (r ≈ −0.39), which may buffer against depressive symptoms. There is an inconsistency in the self-esteem score (reported value outside the documented scale range), but its Z-score (0.82) and the strong negative correlation of self-esteem with CES-D (r ≈ −0.71) suggest higher perceived self-worth in this individual relative to the sample, another potentially protective factor.

Integrative assessment and ranking: weighing the available indicators, there is substantial evidence consistent with elevated depressive symptom burden—particularly the elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.86), higher perceived stress (PSS Z = 0.92), lower self-reported happiness, short and late sleep, and a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep. These signals are, in the study, strongly or moderately associated with higher CES-D scores. Counterbalancing evidence includes robust circadian structure (higher amplitude, lower intradaily variability), low resting heart rate, high health satisfaction, and an apparently higher-than-average self-esteem Z-score; these factors are associated with lower depressive symptoms. On balance, the pattern of elevated anxiety/stress and subjective sleep disturbance alongside reduced reported happiness carries greater weight for depressive symptomology given the strong correlations observed in the cohort. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the CES-D distribution relative to the study sample.

23270,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"The self-report profile presents a mixture of risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56) is elevated relative to the sample and, given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.82), is the single survey-based variable most strongly linked to higher depressive symptom scores. However, several other self-report indices point in the opposite direction: Rosenberg self-esteem is relatively high (score = 37, Z = -0.17) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), current happiness is above average (self-rated 4.0, Z = 0.55) and negatively associated with CES-D, perceived stress is lower than average (PSS Z = -0.71), and overall health satisfaction is above average. Collectively these suggest a generally favorable subjective functioning despite a modestly elevated trait anxiety score.

Behavioral and lifestyle data further support a low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden. The participant reports frequent exercise (alone and in sports; Zs 1.07–1.58), minimal substance use, and very strong academic performance (GPAs near 4.0). These behaviors are typically protective and, in this dataset, exercise and low substance use show small negative correlations with CES-D. One behavioral domain of potential concern is limited daily socializing (16–30 minutes; Z ≈ -1.41), which could convey some risk for low social support, though in this sample socializing shows little relationship to CES-D (near-zero correlation).

Objective sleep and circadian physiology are generally consistent with good sleep and robust daytime physiology. Fitbit-derived sleep shows long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 49 min; Z = 2.03) and a low PSQI (4.0, classified as good sleep), with modest variability in start time and duration. The absence of naps and the low sleep variability argue for consolidated nocturnal sleep; long sleep here may reflect healthy sleep opportunity rather than pathological hypersomnia given the favorable subjective sleep quality. Circadian summary metrics indicate moderate regularity (interdaily stability ≈ 0.38, slightly below average) and modest intradaily variability (0.60, slightly above average). Heart-rate features show a pronounced nocturnal nadir (large negative deviations overnight) and marked elevations in the mid-to-late morning and around midday; the acrophase at approximately 2:42 PM and a relatively low resting heart rate (~55 bpm) are consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Importantly, most wearable-derived circadian and sleep metrics show little or no correlation with CES-D in this dataset, suggesting limited predictive weight for depressive symptom burden here.

Integrative interpretation and CES-D placement: weighing the relative strengths of the indicators, the strongest single contributor toward higher CES-D would be the moderately elevated trait anxiety (high STAI and its strong dataset-level correlation with CES-D). However, multiple robust protective signals—high self-esteem, above-average happiness, low perceived stress, frequent exercise, minimal substance use, excellent academic performance, good subjective and objective sleep, and physiological markers consistent with fitness—provide substantial countervailing evidence for lower depressive symptomatology. Wearable circadian metrics and sleep do not substantially support elevated CES-D for this participant. On balance, the preponderance of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study population with respect to CES-D scores.

70125,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"The self-report profile shows a mixed but concerning pattern with respect to mood-related risk. The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86; classified “anxious”) and very elevated perceived stress (PSS = 29; Z = 2.01). These two measures have strong established associations with depressive symptomatology (the STAI score correlates 0.81 with CES-D in the sample, and PSS shows a moderate positive correlation), and their magnitudes here are meaningfully above the study mean. At the same time, global self-worth appears preserved (Rosenberg Self‑Esteem = 39; Z = 0.11) and momentary reported happiness is slightly above average (current happy = 4; Z = 0.55), both factors that tend to be protective against depression. Interpersonal trust is notably low (2.33; Z = -1.74), and overall health satisfaction is below average (Z ≈ -0.95), which may signal reduced social resources and lower perceived well-being despite adequate self‑esteem.

Sleep measures indicate subjective and objective disturbance that are relevant for mood. The PSQI classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7), and Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is slightly below the cohort mean (6 h 57 m; Z = -0.29). More salient is the high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 159 minutes; Z = 1.32) and a late median sleep onset (≈ 01:44), with moderate variability in sleep start times. Together these features—subjective poor sleep quality, large variability in duration, and late/irregular timing—are commonly linked to poorer mood and elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular summaries suggest a relatively dampened and less-stable circadian pattern. The cosinor amplitude and MESOR are below the sample mean (Amplitude Z = -0.52; MESOR Z = -0.41), interdaily stability is reduced (Value = 0.34; Z = -0.57), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -0.70), consistent with reduced day-to-day regularity in heart-rate rhythms. Resting heart rate is on the lower side (53 bpm; Z = -0.61). Hourly aggregate deviations show a normal nocturnal heart‑rate nadir and a relative evening increase, with particularly elevated deviation during 7–8 PM (Z = 1.03) and 8–10 PM windows—suggesting elevated evening physiological arousal. Overall, these patterns point to circadian attenuation and irregularity, which are often associated with mood dysregulation.

Behavioral and social habit indicators provide mixed inputs. The participant exercises frequently (exercising alone three times per week; Z = 1.07), a behavior typically linked with lower depressive symptoms. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), and recreational drug use is absent. Time spent socializing with friends is below average (Z = -0.62) and many sedentary/leisure activities are minimal; low social engagement and low interpersonal trust could reduce social buffering against stress and mood problems.

Weighing evidence across modalities: several strong risk signals for elevated depressive symptoms are present—very high perceived stress (Z = 2.01), elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.86, which has a high correlation with CES‑D in this sample), disturbed subjective sleep with large objective variability, low interpersonal trust, and attenuated/irregular circadian heart‑rate rhythms. Counterbalancing protective signals include relatively high self‑esteem, modestly elevated momentary happiness, regular solitary exercise, and a healthy resting heart rate. Given the magnitude of the stress and anxiety indicators (including the very high PSS) and their strong associations with CES‑D in the study, the overall pattern is more consistent with a CES‑D score in the upper half of the cohort distribution.

67192,32.0,0.9300518134715026,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological synthesis:

Self-report measures indicate a profile characterized by elevated anxious temperament and perceived stress alongside reduced positive self-appraisals. The participant’s trait anxiety score (STAI = 58, z = +1.65) and perceived stress (PSS = 31, z = +2.55) are both well above sample means; the STAI score in particular has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81). Concurrently, self-esteem is below average (RSES = 33, z = −0.73) and reported momentary happiness is low (2, z = −1.61); both of these measures are negatively correlated with CES-D (self-esteem r ≈ −0.71, happiness r ≈ −0.46). Other self-report signals that align with greater depressive symptom burden include low interpersonal trust (z = −2.39), low health satisfaction (z = −2.03), and a PSQI score in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7), all of which have nontrivial correlations with CES-D in the study sample. Taken together, the strongest self-report indicators (high trait anxiety, high perceived stress, low self-esteem and low happiness) align with an elevated likelihood of higher CES-D scores.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep timing show a mixed but concerning pattern. Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 71.8 bpm, z = +1.62; mesor = 88.67, z = +2.01) and both have modest positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.18), consistent with greater physiological arousal associated with higher symptom burden. The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show normal nocturnal dipping but notable evening elevation (notably 10–11 pm deviation high, z = +1.55), which could reflect elevated evening arousal or activity close to typical sleep onset. Circadian summary metrics indicate relatively high interdaily stability (z ≈ +0.91) and moderately low intradaily variability (z ≈ −0.32), suggesting that day-to-day timing of heart-rate rhythms is reasonably regular. However, sleep timing metrics reveal a late median sleep start time (≈ 1:15 am) with large night-to-night variability in sleep onset (start-time SD ≈ 110 minutes, z ≈ +0.59); these timing irregularities have small positive associations with CES-D in this sample. Notably, median sleep duration is near normal (≈7 h 16 m, z ≈ +0.10), which may help explain the normal intradaily variability and some preserved circadian regularity despite late and inconsistent bedtimes. Overall, physiologic signals emphasize elevated tonic arousal (elevated RHR/mesor) and late/irregular sleep timing, both of which are modestly related to higher depressive symptoms in the sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle context provides partial counterpoints and additional nuance. The participant reports substantial social time (socializing >4 hours/day, z ≈ +2.53), which is commonly a protective behavioral resource; however, the interpersonal-trust score is very low and its negative correlation with CES-D suggests this social contact may not fully buffer mood symptoms. Physical activity is low-to-moderate (exercise 1–2×/week), and sedentary leisure (video games, media) is above average; substance use is minimal. Low BMI (17.8) and low health satisfaction may reflect somatic or nutritional vulnerabilities that can interact with mood, though causal directions are not established here.

Holistic interpretation and weighting of evidence for CES-D group placement:

Evidence supporting a higher CES-D score (top 50% of the sample)
- Very elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress (high z-scores) with large correlations to CES-D.
- Low self-esteem, low self-reported happiness, low trust, and low health satisfaction — all of which are correlated with higher CES-D.
- Elevated resting heart rate and elevated mesor (z > +1.6 and +2.0 respectively), consistent with tonic physiological arousal linked to depressive symptoms.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) combined with late and irregular sleep onset (large start-time SD), features modestly associated with higher CES-D.

Evidence supporting a lower or average CES-D score (bottom 50% of the sample)
- Median sleep duration is within a normative range (~7 h 16 m) and intradaily variability is not elevated, which can be protective.
- Strong social engagement by reported hours could be protective against severe symptom burden.
- Low levels of substance use and some preserved circadian stability suggest behavioral regularity in certain domains.

Conclusion:
The preponderance of high-weight indicators associated with CES-D (particularly the very elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, plus low self-esteem/happiness and elevated resting heart rate/mesor) outweigh the more limited protective signals (normal average sleep duration, social time, circadian stability). Thus, the balance of multimodal evidence suggests this participant’s depressive symptom burden is more consistent with the higher half of the study distribution.

97448,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a psychological profile characterized by relatively low trait anxiety and generally positive self-regard. The STAI–Trait score is 33 (z = -0.82), placing the participant below the study mean for chronic anxiety proneness; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.81), this low anxiety score is a robust signal that aligns with lower depressive symptom burden. The Rosenberg self‑esteem score is elevated relative to the population (z ≈ 0.4) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), which further supports a lower CES‑D likelihood. Current self-rated happiness is modestly below the mean (z ≈ -0.53), and perceived stress is near or slightly below average (PSS = 20, z ≈ -0.44), so there are mild signals of reduced positive affect but not of pronounced stress or anxiety that would typically co-occur with higher CES‑D scores.

Behavioral and social habit data show mostly protective patterns with some social limitations. The participant exercises regularly (exercising alone three+ times per week; z ≈ 1.07) and demonstrates low resting heart rate (50.8 bpm, z ≈ -0.87), both of which are generally associated with better physical health and lower depressive symptoms (resting HR correlates positively with CES‑D in the sample, so a lower RHR points toward lower CES‑D). Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week) and non-prescribed/recreational drug use is absent. Social exercise and organized sports are not endorsed (z-scores strongly negative), and time spent socializing is modest (1–2 hours daily, z ≈ 0.16). High interpersonal trust (z ≈ 1.47, r ≈ -0.41 with CES‑D) suggests relatively good social attitudes, which is consistent with lower depressive symptom risk despite less group-based physical activity.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology show a pattern of adequate and regular rest with a late sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 12 min (z ≈ 0.02), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 63 minutes, z ≈ -0.86), and mean daily naps are rare. These features (adequate duration, low variability) are typically favorable with respect to depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) is in the “disturbed sleep” range, but only slightly above the common clinical cutpoint and not strongly divergent from the study mean (z ≈ -0.33). Median sleep onset is late (≈ 1:44 AM), which may reflect chronobiological habits or schedule constraints; late bedtimes can be associated with mood risk in some contexts, but here the combination of sufficient total sleep and regular timing (interdaily stability = 0.53, z ≈ 1.0; autocorrelation at 24 h z ≈ 1.15) indicates a relatively stable circadian pattern overall.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate dynamics reinforce an organized and physiologically robust daily rhythm. Cosinor amplitude is relatively high (z ≈ 1.29) and intradaily variability is near the population mean (z ≈ -0.04), indicating marked day–night separation and consistent day-to-day structure; in this dataset higher amplitude and greater stability are weakly associated with lower CES‑D, so these features point away from elevated depressive symptoms. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal declines (large negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations in mid-afternoon and evening; these aggregated patterns are consistent with preserved physiological diurnal variation and fitness-related low resting values, rather than blunted or flattened rhythms often observed with higher depressive symptomatology.

Integrated interpretation and ranking: multiple, converging indicators support a relatively low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden. Strong protective signals include low trait anxiety, comparatively high self‑esteem, high interpersonal trust, regular and sufficiently long sleep with low variability, frequent individual exercise, low resting heart rate, and robust circadian amplitude and stability. Mixed or mildly negative signals include a slightly elevated PSQI score (6), late habitual sleep onset, and self-rated happiness modestly below average. On balance, the preponderance and effect sizes of indicators associated with lower CES‑D make it more likely that this participant’s CES‑D score falls in the lower half of the study distribution.

The participant reports moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25; Z = 0.92); both measures have positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI r = 0.81, PSS r = 0.28), indicating these dispositions are strongly and moderately associated with greater depressive symptoms in this cohort. Global self-evaluations are relatively low: Rosenberg self-esteem is substantially below the sample mean (score = 31; Z = -1.01) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71). Current self-reported happiness is also low (score = 2.0; Z = -1.61; r = -0.46). Together, these self-report patterns—higher anxiety and stress plus low self-esteem and subjective happiness—constitute robust psychosocial signals that align with higher depressive symptom burden.

Lifestyle and behavioral measures provide additional context consistent with elevated risk. The participant endorses little or no exercise (exercise Z-scores between -1.09 and -1.93), minimal socializing (socializing Z = -0.62), and few structured recreational or sport activities. Sleep quality by self-report is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7; classified as disturbed sleep), and health satisfaction is low (Z = -1.2). BMI is in the obese range (30.04), which along with low health satisfaction can be associated with poorer mood. Substance use is minimal or none, which reduces some behavioral confounds but does not offset the cluster of sedentary and socially isolated habits that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian features show a mixed pattern: heart-rate–based circadian regularity appears relatively strong, which is typically a resilience-like marker. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.56; Z = 1.24) and 24-hour autocorrelation is high (Z = 1.4), while intradaily variability is lower than average (Z = -0.74). These metrics indicate a stable, regular daily rhythm in cardiovascular activity across the recording period. At the same time, central heart-rate values are somewhat elevated (MESOR = 82.08, Z = 1.11; resting HR = 65.2, Z = 0.84), and the mesor and resting HR have small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19). Aggregate hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and afternoon–evening peaks; there is no clear wearable-derived signature of fragmented or highly irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ~00:22, SD ~87 minutes). Median nightly sleep duration is slightly below sample average (~6 h 54 min; Z = -0.35), with low nap frequency. In sum, the wearable data present a relatively regular circadian profile (potentially protective) but with modestly elevated cardiovascular baseline indices that have small positive associations with depressive symptoms in the sample.

Integrating modalities yields a coherent picture: strong self-report signals (high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low happiness, elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, low social/physical activity, low health satisfaction) point toward an elevated depressive symptom burden. Wearable physiology provides partial counterbalancing evidence in the form of a stable circadian rhythm, but this does not fully offset the magnitude or number of psychosocial risk indicators; modestly elevated resting heart rate and MESOR are also consistent with greater symptom burden. Given the high correlations of anxiety and low self-esteem with CES-D in this population and the participant’s notable deviations on these measures, the overall evidence is more consistent with placement in the higher half of the CES-D distribution rather than the lower half.

87328,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant’s trait and state self-report measures consistently indicate relatively low internalizing symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is low (score 23, z = -1.81), and perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS z = -1.80), both of which contrast with patterns typically seen in higher depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are both elevated (SelfEsteem z = 1.66; Happy z = 1.64), measures that are strongly negatively associated with CES-D scores in this sample (notably self-esteem r = -0.71). Collectively, these high-positive indicators of self-regard and low anxiety/stress provide behavioral and cognitive evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms.

Social, academic and lifestyle behaviors: The participant reports high levels of social engagement (socializing >4 hours, z = 2.53) and above-average academic performance (GPAs ~3.8–3.92). Substance use is absent, and involvement in sports is above average (sports frequency z = 0.91), although more structured exercise alone or with others is infrequent. Leisure activities skew toward sedentary media use (watching TV/videos z = 2.54; music listening z = 1.6), which could reflect recreational preference rather than withdrawal. Overall, frequent social contact and strong academic functioning weigh against elevated depressive symptomatology, while some sedentary leisure patterns may be neutral or mildly risk-related but are not, in isolation, compelling indicators of high CES-D burden.

Sleep and circadian physiology (wearable + self-report): Objective sleep duration is within the typical range (median 7 h 25 min, z = 0.30) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD z = -0.57). However, habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep onset ~01:26) and subjective sleep quality is mildly disturbed (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed; z = 0.13). The wearable-derived circadian metrics show a well-structured rhythm: interdaily stability is above average (z = 1.0), amplitude is relatively high (z = 1.78), and autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (z = 1.57), consistent with a robust, regular 24-hour pattern of cardiac activity. Resting heart rate is modestly below average (54.4 bpm, z = -0.45). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal nadirs and pronounced evening elevations (notably 6–7 pm z = 2.62), indicating preserved diurnal modulation of physiological arousal. In sum, objective sleep quantity and circadian regularity are supportive of good physiological functioning despite subjective sleep complaints and late timing.

Integration and implications for depressive symptoms: Multiple independent indicators converge toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. Key self-report predictors that strongly correlate with CES-D in this sample (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, higher momentary happiness, low perceived stress) are all closer to the favorable (low symptom) end of the distribution. Behavioral context—ample socializing, high academic performance, absence of substance use—and physiological markers—adequate sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, robust circadian organization, and low resting heart rate—provide convergent objective support for lower CES-D scores. The main countervailing observations are a PSQI score suggesting subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing, plus elevated sedentary entertainment time and a modestly low health satisfaction score; these could exert small upward pressure on depressive symptoms but do not outweigh the multiple stronger indicators of low symptom burden.

Conclusion (CES-D distribution placement): Considering the preponderance of evidence from trait/state self-report, social and academic functioning, and objective wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology, the participant is most consistent with a CES-D score in the bottom half of the study distribution (relatively low or average depressive symptoms).

Rosenberg self‑esteem is low at 22 (Z = -2.28), a feature strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.70). Current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), and perceived stress is above average (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), both of which align with higher depressive symptom burden in the population (moderate correlations reported). Other interpersonal and well‑being signals—lower interpersonal trust (Z = -1.42) and only modest satisfaction with health (Z = 0.55)—further reinforce a self-report pattern associated with greater depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle data indicate a mix of risk and protective factors. The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three times per week; Z = 1.07), which is mildly protective relative to depressive symptoms, but reports no exercise with others (Z = -1.58) and limited socializing with friends (16–30 minutes; Z = -1.41), which point to reduced social engagement—an established risk factor for depressive symptoms. Recreation and screen use show elevated internet time (3–4 hours; Z = 1.52) and minimal sedentary hobbies or gaming, while substance and non‑prescribed drug use are reported at frequencies with very high sample Z‑scores (e.g., non‑prescribed drugs Z ≈ 13.8), though their direct correlations with CES‑D in this sample are small. Academic performance (GPA) and BMI are within normative ranges, which may provide some functional buffering.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology reveal delayed, irregular sleep timing and reduced circadian robustness. Median sleep onset is late (~01:14) with a very large night‑to‑night start‑time standard deviation (SD ≈ 204 minutes, Z = 2.65), indicating highly variable and delayed sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is ~6.5 hours (Z = -0.85) with elevated night‑to‑night duration variability (SD ≈ 148 min, Z = 1.06). Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05). Complementing these sleep reports, heart‑rate based circadian metrics show low interdaily stability (0.21, Z = -1.65) and reduced amplitude (5.95, Z = -1.56), consistent with blunted or irregular 24‑hour physiological rhythms. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.63, Z = 0.60), suggesting some fragmentation in activity/arousal patterns across the day. These objective and subjective sleep/circadian features are commonly associated with higher depressive symptom levels.

Aggregated diurnal heart rate deviations present expected nocturnal decreases and daytime increases, with a pronounced morning elevation (9–11am) and an atypical late‑evening HR elevation around 10–11pm (value and Z elevated). Resting heart rate and mesor are near the sample mean (both small positive Zs). Hourly HR deviation correlations with CES‑D are generally small; however, the broader pattern of reduced circadian amplitude and low day‑to‑day stability aligns with the participant’s self‑reported sleep irregularity and higher symptom indices.

Holistic synthesis and CES‑D ranking: convergent evidence from multiple modalities points toward relatively elevated depressive symptomatology. Strong signals driving this conclusion include markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI), markedly low self‑esteem, low self‑reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, late and highly variable sleep timing, and objectively reduced circadian stability and amplitude. Some protective signs exist (regular solitary exercise, normal academic performance, normative resting HR), but they do not outweigh the consistent pattern of risk markers across self-report and wearable-derived measures.

Sleep quality is mildly disturbed (PSQI = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which often co-occurs with depressive symptoms. At the same time, perceived stress is lower than the sample average (PSS Z = -0.71) and self-reported current happiness is above average (Happy Z = 0.55), suggesting the participant maintains some positive affect and lower subjective stress relative to peers. These mixed signals indicate salient internalizing symptoms (notably anxiety and low self-regard) alongside some preserved subjective well-being.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are largely neutral-to-protective. The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Exercise Alone Z = 1.07), minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and only occasional alcohol use—patterns that typically associate with lower depressive symptom burden or provide resilience. Socializing time is near the sample median (1–2 hours, Z = 0.16), while sedentary leisure and video-game time are comparatively high (Video Games Z = 2.47; Sedentary Hobby Z = 2.01), behaviors that in some contexts can be associated with higher depressive symptoms but here show only small positive correlations with CES-D in the study. Academic performance (GPA series) appears intact.

Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show above-average 24-hour regularity (Autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 1.06; Interdaily Stability Z = 0.58) and very low intraday variability (Intradaily Variability Z = -2.08), indicating a stable, entrained daily pattern with limited fragmentation. Resting heart rate and mesor are near sample averages. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and afternoon/evening elevations; none of these wearable circadian metrics show strong correlations with CES-D in this dataset (all correlations near zero).

Integrative interpretation and CES-D placement: the strongest, most CES-D–predictive signals in this profile are elevated trait anxiety and lower self-esteem—both of which have large correlations with CES-D in the sample and are meaningfully offset from the sample mean (STAI Z = +1.45; Self-Esteem Z = -0.87). PSQI-defined disturbed sleep adds converging evidence for symptom burden. Conversely, objective sleep duration, high regularity of circadian rhythm, regular exercise, low substance use, and modestly elevated self-reported happiness argue against severe or pervasive functional impairment. On balance, however, the magnitude and strength of the anxiety and self-esteem indicators (which are highly predictive of CES-D within this cohort) tilt the overall likelihood toward an elevated CES-D score relative to the study population.

33009,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"Trait and symptom self-report pattern: The participant reports comparatively high self-esteem (RSES = 40; Z = 0.26), a near-average trait anxiety score (STAI = 40; Z = -0.13), and a moderate perceived stress score that is below the sample mean (PSS = 19; Z = -0.71). Self-reported current happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (score = 3.0; Z = -0.53) and interpersonal trust is modestly low (score = 3.0; Z = -0.46). Of these, the strongest signal relevant to depressive symptoms is the very high self-esteem, which (given the large negative correlation with CES-D in the sample, r ≈ -0.71) is a protective indicator against elevated depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety and perceived stress show associations with CES-D at the sample level (positive correlations), but the participant’s scores on those measures are at or below average, providing little evidence of marked symptom elevation on these dimensions.

Sleep and subjective sleep quality: Objective sleep metrics are generally favorable. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long and above the sample median (median = 7 h 54 m; Z = 0.89) with low night-to-night variability in both duration and sleep start time (SD ≈ 55 minutes; Z for variability ≈ -1.03 and -0.61), and no recorded naps. These objective indices indicate regular, sufficient sleep quantity. In contrast, the participant’s PSQI score (7.0) crosses the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep and is slightly above sample average (Z = 0.13), suggesting some subjective difficulties or perceived sleep problems despite objectively adequate duration and regularity. The discordance between subjective poor sleep and objectively regular, sufficient sleep is notable; subjective sleep disturbance can relate to depressive symptom reports even when wearable measures appear normative.

Circadian and cardiac activity patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics show a relatively low mesor (mean HR ≈ 68.8 bpm; Z = -0.71) and a reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude ≈ 7.95; Z = -0.92), with acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈ 3:51 PM). Non-parametric rhythm indices indicate below-average interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.49) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.53). Together these signs suggest a somewhat blunted and less stable day–night heart rate rhythm compared with the study sample. Associations between these circadian metrics and CES-D in the sample are small to modest; amplitude has a weak negative correlation with CES-D (suggesting lower amplitude can be associated with higher symptoms), but the participant’s amplitude is only moderately reduced. Resting heart rate is typical for the sample (58.1 bpm; Z ≈ -0.01). The aggregated hourly deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal trough (~-14 bpm overnight) and daytime elevations (peaking ~10–11 bpm mid-day), indicating a preserved basic day–night pattern despite reduced amplitude.

Activity, social behavior, and substances: The participant reports moderate social and physical activity: exercising alone and with others 1–2 times per week, socializing with friends 1–2 hours daily, and limited sedentary recreational media use. Substance use is modest (wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; beer less frequent; no recreational/non-prescribed drugs). These behavioral patterns (regular, if moderate, social contact and some exercise, low recreational drug use) are generally associated with lower depressive symptomatology in the sample (negative but small correlations with CES-D), and there is no clear behavioral signal of withdrawal or major reduction in rewarding activities.

Synthesis regarding depressive symptom burden: Integrating the multimodal data, the preponderance of evidence points toward relatively low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. The strongest protective indicator is very high self-esteem (highly negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample). Objective sleep duration and stability are favorable, resting HR is typical, and social/exercise behaviors are not suggestive of marked behavioral withdrawal. Countervailing signals include a PSQI score indicating subjective sleep disturbance, somewhat reduced self-reported happiness and trust, and a modestly blunted circadian amplitude and lower interdaily stability; these features could reflect subclinical symptoms or individual differences in perception of sleep and well-being, but they are not large or pervasive enough to outweigh the protective signals. Considering the available correlations and z-scores together, the balance of evidence supports placing this participant in the lower half of the CES-D distribution (i.e., not among the higher-symptom group).

96184,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Self-report profile: The participant reports a modestly elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 42; Z ≈ 0.07) but not substantially higher than the cohort mean; the STAI–CES-D correlation in this sample is large (r ≈ 0.81), so anxiety would be an important predictor if it were elevated. Self-esteem is at the upper end of the scale (RSES = 40; Z ≈ 0.26) and, given the strong negative correlation between self-esteem and CES-D in this population (r ≈ −0.71), this is a salient protective marker against depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is somewhat above the population mean (PSS = 23; Z ≈ 0.38), and momentary happiness is somewhat below average (current happy = 3.0; Z ≈ −0.53), both pointing toward some distress but of small-to-moderate magnitude relative to the cohort. Sleep quality by self-report (PSQI = 7) meets a threshold commonly used to indicate disturbed sleep, which is relevant because PSQI scores have a modest relationship with CES-D in the sample.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics: Heart-rate circadian metrics indicate reduced circadian robustness. Interdaily stability is low (value 0.22; Z ≈ −1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z ≈ −1.79), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z ≈ 0.39). Parametric cosinor features show a relatively low mesor and a reduced amplitude (mesor Z ≈ −1.0; amplitude Z ≈ −1.48), suggesting blunted daily variation in cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is in the low-normal range (55.5 bpm; Z ≈ −0.32). The pattern of hourly deviations (large negative deviations during early-morning hours and modest positive deviations in afternoon/evening) is consistent with a circadian trough during sleep and an afternoon/evening rise, but the aggregated shape combined with low interdaily stability points to inconsistent day-to-day timing of these rhythms. In this dataset these circadian measures have relatively small correlations with CES-D overall, so they are contributory risk markers but not dominant predictors on their own.

Objective sleep and timing: The wearable sleep summary is a prominent and noteworthy signal. Median nightly sleep duration is short (5 h 27 min; Z ≈ −2.16) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is extremely high (SD ≈ 359 minutes; Z ≈ 5.88). Sleep start time is very late (median ≈ 04:42) and extremely irregular across days (start-time SD Z ≈ 7.44). Mean daily naps are low but slightly above average (Z ≈ 1.27). These objective features indicate chronic short sleep and marked irregularity of sleep timing—both of which are established behavioral correlates of depressive symptoms and here show modest positive correlations with CES-D (sleep SD r ≈ 0.24; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.28). The magnitude of these deviations (very high Z-scores for variability and substantially short median sleep) is one of the strongest single signals in the profile.

Behavioral context and lifestyle: The participant reports minimal substance use, infrequent exercise (exercising alone or with others 1–2 times per month), low engagement in sports, and very limited socializing (16–30 minutes; Z ≈ −1.41). These behavioral markers (low physical activity, limited social contact) are consistent with risk profiles for affective symptoms. Conversely, the participant indicates high self-esteem, moderate satisfaction with health, and low substance involvement—factors that reduce likelihood of elevated depressive symptom burden. Listening to music is relatively higher than average and may represent a coping or leisure behavior. Overall, the behavioral profile is mixed: protective traits in self-esteem and low substance use coexist with risk-related behaviors of sleep irregularity, low activity, and limited social engagement.

Holistic interpretation relative to CES-D distribution: Weighing the profile, the most robust objective signals supporting elevated depressive symptoms are the extreme short sleep duration and dramatic variability and irregularity of sleep timing—features with modest positive correlations to CES-D in this sample and with very large Z-scores within the cohort. However, several important protective indicators counterbalance that risk: maximal self‑esteem, only modest trait anxiety (near cohort mean), low substance use, and normal resting heart rate. Perceived stress and reduced momentary happiness suggest some distress but not extreme elevations. Because self-esteem has a strong negative association with CES‑D in the population (r ≈ −0.71) and this participant scores at the ceiling, that protective factor carries considerable weight in predicting lower depressive symptom burden. Taking the multimodal evidence together—severe sleep irregularity but otherwise mixed-to-protective psychological and behavioral markers—the overall balance favors a CES‑D score at or below the population median rather than the top half.

Self-esteem is low (RSES = 25; Z = −1.85), another strong inverse correlate of CES-D (r ≈ −0.70). Current self-reported happiness is also low (score = 2.0; Z = −1.61; r ≈ −0.46). Perceived stress appears moderate (PSS = 20; Z = −0.44) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is just above common cutoffs for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), but these have smaller correlations with CES-D in the provided data. Interpersonal trust and global health satisfaction are below the study mean (trust Z ≈ −1.1; health satisfaction Z ≈ −0.86), which align with the broader pattern of reduced psychosocial resources. In sum, self-report measures show several sizable deviations from the sample mean in directions that, given their reported correlations with CES-D, point toward a higher depressive symptom burden.

Objective wearable-derived behavior and physiology present a mixed but generally resilience-indicative pattern. Nightly sleep duration is near the sample median (median = 7 h 15 m; Z ≈ +0.09) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD ≈ 88 minutes; Z ≈ −0.29) and relatively low variability in sleep start times (SD ≈ 47 minutes; Z ≈ −0.80). Circadian regularity measures are relatively strong: interdaily stability (0.55; Z ≈ +1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 h (0.46; Z ≈ +1.15) are elevated, and intradaily variability is lower than average (0.47; Z ≈ −0.53). Resting heart rate is on the lower side of the sample (56.7 bpm; Z ≈ −0.17) and mesor and amplitude are near average, which together suggest generally intact cardiovascular fitness and a consolidated daily rhythm. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and an evening elevation in the 9–11 PM window (deviations ~+14 bpm; Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.26), indicating some late-evening physiological activation or alertness. Behavioral items that tend to protect against higher CES-D in this sample — exercising with others frequently (Z ≈ +1.23) and relatively regular daily structure — are present and moderate alcohol use is common for the sample. Overall, wearables indicate circadian regularity and adequate objective sleep duration, both of which are generally protective against depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation weighing modalities: psychological self-report and wearable data give a mixed picture, but the strongest and most CES-D-predictive signals in this participant come from self-report. High trait anxiety (large positive z and high r with CES-D), markedly low self-esteem, and low current happiness are substantial risk indicators for elevated CES-D scores. Wearable data show protective behavioral regularity (stable sleep timing, high interdaily stability, social exercise) that may buffer symptom severity but do not fully counterbalance the magnitude of self-reported emotional distress. Given the very large correlations reported for STAI and self-esteem with CES-D in this dataset and the participant’s pronounced deviations on those measures, the preponderance of evidence points toward a relatively elevated depressive symptom burden compared with the study population.

Conclusion (distributional judgment): considering the strong self-report indicators known to correlate highly with CES-D (high STAI, low RSES, low happiness) together with the moderating but weaker protective wearable signals, the participant is more consistent with scoring in the upper half of the study distribution on the CES-D.

The participant reports very low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71) and high self-esteem (RSES, Z = 1.66); these two scales have strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI r = 0.81; SelfEsteem r = -0.71), so the participant’s scores on these highly predictive measures point toward lower CES-D scores. Self-rated happiness is elevated (current = 5.0, Z = 1.64; Happiness r with CES-D = -0.46) and perceived stress is slightly below average for the population (PSS Z = -0.44), further supporting a low-to-moderate burden of affective symptoms. Health satisfaction is high (Z = 1.3) and academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.7–3.82), which are additional contextual indicators consistent with relatively low depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are broadly consistent with adaptive functioning. The participant reports regular physical activity (exercising alone three times a week or more, Z = 1.07) and modest social engagement (socializing 1–2 hours, Z = 0.16). Substance use is limited (beer 1–2 times/week; no wine/liquor or recreational/non-prescribed drug use), and daily recreational habits include reading and listening to music but little gaming. Sleep behavior, as reported and measured, is generally within normative bounds: median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 h 24 min (Z = 0.27), sleep timing is near midnight onset (median start ~00:38), variability in sleep duration and timing are lower than the sample mean (Z = -0.69 and Z = -0.21 respectively), and the PSQI score (5.0, Z = -0.8) is at the conventional threshold but classified here as “Good Sleep.” These behavioral footprints (regular exercise, adequate sleep duration with low variability, low substance use, and ongoing social/academic engagement) align with lower risk for elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate a generally regular and consolidated daily pattern with a small but notable elevation in mean heart-rate level. Non-parametric circadian metrics show moderate interdaily stability (0.46, Z = 0.42) and relatively low intradaily variability (0.38, Z = -1.16), suggesting consistent day-to-day structure and limited fragmentation of activity/physiology. Cosinor measures show a pronounced mesor (91.26, Z = 2.36) and an amplitude above the sample mean (Amplitude Z = 1.01); resting heart rate is modestly elevated (67.65 bpm, Z = 1.13). Hourly aggregated deviations display an expected nocturnal dip (substantial negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations peaking in the afternoon. In the correlational context, mesor and resting heart rate have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.2), meaning the participant’s elevated mesor/RHR could be a minor source of risk for higher CES-D, but effect sizes are small and other circadian measures (low intradaily variability, reasonable interdaily stability, normal sleep duration) are protective.

Evidence for lower CES-D (bottom 50): very low trait anxiety (STAI Z -1.71) and high self-esteem (Z 1.66) are the most predictive indicators and both strongly imply low depressive symptoms given their high sample correlations with CES-D. Elevated happiness, low-to-moderate perceived stress, good sleep duration with low variability, regular exercise and social/academic functioning, and low substance use all support the likelihood of lower CES-D. Evidence for higher CES-D (top 50): modestly elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ~2.36 and 1.13) are the primary wearable-derived signals that weakly associate with higher CES-D in the sample, but their correlations with CES-D are small and other physiological/circadian metrics are not indicative of dysregulation.

Holistic synthesis: the preponderance of high-weight self-report indicators (particularly low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, which have strong sample correlations with CES-D), combined with adaptive lifestyle patterns and stable sleep/circadian structure, outweigh the small risk signal from an elevated mesor/resting heart rate. Overall, the evidence most strongly supports placement in the lower half of the study population distribution for depressive symptoms.

22913,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant’s self-report instruments show a pattern consistent with relatively low affective symptom burden. Trait anxiety is low (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72; classified “not anxious”), and self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 38, Z ≈ -0.03 relative to sample mean) — two measures that are strongly linked to depressive symptom variability in this cohort (STAI–CES-D r = 0.81; SelfEsteem–CES-D r = -0.71). Perceived stress is modestly below the study mean (PSS Score = 20, Z = -0.44), and a single-item happiness rating is somewhat below average (Current Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53), suggesting some reduced positive affect but not the concomitant high anxiety or elevated stress commonly seen with higher CES-D scores. Overall, the self-report pattern (low trait anxiety, preserved self-worth, modest stress) points away from a high depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant reports limited structured physical activity (exercise alone and with others both ~1–2 times/month; sports: not at all; Z-scores range from -0.17 to -1.09) and some sedentary leisure (sedentary hobby Z = 0.82). Alcohol use is present at a light-to-moderate frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2×/week; Z ≈ +1.0), and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Socializing is mid-to-low relative to peers (reported ~31 minutes/hour; Z = -0.62). In isolation, low exercise and reduced social/leisure engagement are behavioral correlates that can be associated with higher depressive symptoms in some samples, but in this participant they are set against otherwise protective psychosocial indicators (low anxiety, high self-esteem), suggesting these lifestyle factors are not translating into a markedly elevated symptom profile.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: Objective sleep metrics indicate relatively long and stable nocturnal sleep (median sleep duration 8 h 37 m, Z = +1.79) with moderate variability (sleep duration SD = 92 minutes, Z ≈ -0.19) and typical sleep start time near midnight. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) is classified as “good sleep.” Circadian rhythm measures from heart rate show a pronounced mesor (MESOR = 87.24, Z = +1.81) and moderately elevated resting heart rate (RHR = 64.6 bpm, Z = +0.77), but low intradaily variability (IV = 0.29, Z = -1.8) and average interdaily stability (IS = 0.41, Z = 0.0). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime elevations with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:49 PM). Together, these wearable indicators suggest a well-structured, regular circadian profile and adequate sleep quantity — patterns that are generally inversely associated with depressive symptom severity in this dataset.

Integration and implications for depressive symptoms: The strongest predictors of elevated CES-D scores in this cohort are high trait anxiety and low self-esteem; this participant scores low on anxiety and high on self-esteem, which substantially reduces the a priori likelihood of a high CES-D. Objective physiology and sleep corroborate a lower risk profile (long sleep duration, low intradaily variability, structured daily rhythm). Behavioral shortfalls (infrequent exercise, limited social/leisure activities, elevated BMI) represent potential contributors to mood vulnerability but are relatively weaker predictors here based on their smaller correlations with CES-D in the provided data. Single-item happiness is modestly below average, which could reflect transient low positive affect, but in the context of low anxiety, good sleep, and strong self-esteem, it does not, by itself, indicate a high overall depressive symptom burden.

Synthesis and ranking relative to the study population: Considering the multimodal evidence and the relative strengths of predictors (notably the strong negative association of self-esteem and strong positive association of trait anxiety with CES-D), the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms. Protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, regular circadian rhythm, long sleep) outweigh the modest risk indicators (low exercise, lower happiness rating, higher BMI). Therefore the participant’s likely CES-D position is in the bottom 50% of the study population.

48969,42.0,0.9896373056994818,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple signals that commonly co-occur with elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is markedly elevated (STAI = 59, z = 1.75) and is strongly positively correlated with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), indicating anxiety-proneness that often amplifies depressive symptom scores. Self‑esteem is substantially low (Rosenberg = 22, z = −2.28) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r = −0.70), a pattern consistent with greater depressive symptoms. Current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2, z = −1.61). Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 22, z ≈ 0.1), suggesting stress is not an outlier driver here but may still contribute. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 13, z = 2.9), indicating clinically notable sleep disturbance by self-report; poor subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher CES‑D scores.

Behavioral patterns relevant to mood:
Daily activities indicate social withdrawal and high screen-based sedentary behavior. Time socializing is extremely low (≈15 minutes, z = −2.20), while video gaming and passive media use are among the highest in the sample (both >4 hours; z = 4.74 and 3.17 respectively). The participant reports exercising frequently but primarily alone (exercised alone three times/week, z = 1.07; exercised with others = not at all, z = −1.58). Substance use is minimal. Academically, GPAs are modest. Together, limited social engagement, high solitary screen time, low self-esteem, and elevated anxiety are behavioral and psychological configurations that tend to align with increased depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived median sleep duration is within the slightly-above-average range for the sample (median = 7 h 51 m, z = 0.84), with no recorded habitual naps, but there is relatively high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 116 minutes, z = 0.33) and a subjective report of poor sleep quality (PSQI). Median sleep start time is around midnight (00:06). These data indicate that although average sleep quantity is adequate, sleep timing irregularity and subjective sleep disturbance are present. Circadian metrics from heart rate show a modestly elevated mesor (mean level; 79.8 bpm, z = 0.79) and elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm, z = 1.24), suggesting a higher baseline cardiovascular tone. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (9.62, z = −0.38), which — together with objectively preserved interdaily stability (~0.4) and a normal-range acrophase (≈5:06 PM) — suggests a rhythm with typical timing but somewhat blunted day–night contrast. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations display an expected nocturnal trough and afternoon/evening peaks; the overall pattern does not show gross circadian misalignment but does show lower amplitude and elevated baseline arousal, features that have modest associations with depressive symptom burden in population studies.

Integration and weighing of evidence:
Evidence supporting higher depressive symptom burden: (1) very strong psychometric indicators tied to depression in this cohort — notably high trait anxiety (STAI) and low self‑esteem with large sample correlations to CES‑D; (2) pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (high PSQI) despite adequate objective sleep duration, a discordance often seen in affective symptomatology; (3) marked social withdrawal and extremely high solitary screen time, behavioral markers that correlate with higher depressive symptoms. Physiological indicators that align with elevated symptom levels include elevated resting HR and reduced circadian amplitude, both of which have modest positive associations with CES‑D in the sample. Evidence supporting lower/average depressive symptom burden: (1) objective average sleep duration is within a healthy range and there are no frequent daytime naps; (2) regular solitary exercise (three times/week) and low substance use are protective behaviors; (3) interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythm is near average. These counterpoints moderate but do not outweigh the stronger self-report signals (high anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep, social restriction) and their strong correlations to CES‑D.

Overall assessment of CES‑D distribution placement:
Considering the balance of multimodal information — particularly the strong, high-correlation self-report markers (STAI and self‑esteem), prominent subjective sleep disturbance, and behavioral signs of social isolation and high sedentary screen time — the preponderance of evidence indicates a higher depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. While some objective indicators (average sleep duration, regular exercise) are neutral or modestly protective, they are insufficient to offset the strong risk-signals. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the CES‑D distribution in this sample.

79731,27.0,0.8549222797927462,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 60; Z = 1.85) and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 29; Z = −1.29). Both of these measures are strongly associated with depressive symptoms in the study sample (STAI–CESD r = 0.81; self-esteem–CESD r = −0.71), indicating that this individual’s high anxiety proneness and lower self-regard are likely to co-occur with higher CES-D scores. Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38) and current self-rated happiness is slightly above average (Z = 0.55) but inversely correlated with depressive symptoms (happy–CESD r = −0.46), whereas low interpersonal trust and low health satisfaction (Z = −0.78 and −1.53, respectively) are additional psychosocial features that have moderate negative correlations with CES-D in this sample. Taken together, the self-report profile shows several risk-related dimensions (high anxiety, low self-esteem, poor health satisfaction, disturbed sleep complaints) that converge toward greater depressive symptom burden.

Subjective and behavioral sleep patterns: The participant reports clinically disturbed sleep (PSQI = 11; Z = 1.98). Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a long median sleep duration (8 h 17 m; Z = 1.37) but marked instability in sleep timing and quantity: sleep duration standard deviation is high (177 minutes; Z = 1.73) and the median sleep start time is very late (approximately 02:58), with moderate variability in start time. There are more naps than average (mean daily naps 0.19; Z = 1.34). This combination—subjective poor sleep quality, long but irregular sleep, late sleep timing, and frequent napping—is consistent with disrupted sleep architecture and circadian misalignment, patterns that in this sample are associated with higher depressive symptomatology.

Physiological and circadian indicators: Heart-rate-based circadian metrics suggest a pattern of higher basal cardiovascular activation and reduced circadian amplitude. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the cohort (71.2 bpm; Z = 1.55) and MESOR is above average (79.9; Z = 0.81), while cosinor amplitude is reduced (7.09; Z = −1.19) and acrophase occurs in the evening (around 6:27 PM). Non-parametric rhythm measures show somewhat elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.67) and below-average interdaily stability (Z = −0.57). Elevated resting heart rate and blunted amplitude are physiologically compatible with increased tonic arousal and dampened circadian rhythmicity; in this dataset these features have small positive correlations with CES-D (e.g., resting HR–CESD r ≈ 0.19) and, when combined with the strong self-report risk markers, point toward greater symptom burden.

Behavioral activity and social patterns: The participant reports minimal structured exercise (several exercise items Z ≤ −1.6 to −1.9), low engagement in organized sports, and modest social interaction (socializing with friends ~1–2 hours; Z ≈ 0.16). Recreational behaviors include elevated internet use and music listening (internet Z = 0.85; music Z = 1.6). Low physical activity, especially exercising alone or with others, and more sedentary recreational patterns are behavioral features that, in other studies and modestly here, are associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Alcohol and drug use are low to occasional and not prominent contributors in this profile.

Integrative interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Multiple, convergent indicators point toward relatively elevated depressive symptoms. The strongest single signals are high trait anxiety and low self-esteem—both tightly correlated with CES-D in this sample—and clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (high PSQI) combined with objective signs of circadian disruption (late and irregular sleep timing, reduced HR amplitude, elevated resting heart rate). Additional supportive features include low health satisfaction, low interpersonal trust, little exercise, and greater variability in sleep duration. A few features (long average sleep duration and modestly elevated self-reported happiness) are not strongly protective given the broader pattern of dysfunction and the known correlations in this dataset. On balance, the weight of evidence indicates the participant’s CES-D score is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) is below the study mean and is classified as “not anxious”; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), the low STAI score provides substantive evidence against elevated depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES reported value labeled 45, Z = 0.96; note: the provided raw value exceeds the conventional RSES range but the Z-score indicates above-average self-esteem), and self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), which further signals lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is high (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and perceived stress is below average (PSS score = 18, Z = -0.98); these directions (happiness negatively correlated with CES-D, stress positively correlated) are consistent with a lower CES-D burden. Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8), which does not suggest the sleep disturbance pattern often associated with higher depressive symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle data are largely consistent with adaptive functioning that would typically co-occur with lower CES-D scores. The participant reports minimal substance use (alcohol and drugs reported “not at all”), low solitary exercise but some group exercise (1–2×/week), and limited daily recreational screen time and internet use (often ≤15 minutes, with very low z-scores). Socializing time is modestly below the sample mean (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41), which is a potential risk factor if it reflected social withdrawal, but other indicators (higher happiness, elevated self-esteem, some group exercise) provide countervailing evidence of adequate social engagement and functioning. Academic performance (GPA values provided across terms, including a 3.93 term) does not suggest functional impairment.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics describe a robust and regular circadian profile with low nocturnal arousal and a pronounced daytime rhythm. Cosinor-derived amplitude is notably high (amplitude = 19.12, Z = 2.7) and interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are above average (interdaily stability Z = 1.41; autocorrelation Z = 1.32), indicating consistent daily structure across the monitoring period. Intradaily variability is not elevated (Z = -0.25), and the acrophase is in the late afternoon (≈4:23 PM), consistent with an organized daytime activity/physiology pattern. Resting heart rate is relatively low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99), and the hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show marked nocturnal declines and clear daytime elevations (peak deviations in the mid- to late-afternoon), which together indicate expected nocturnal quiescence and daytime activation rather than blunted or dysregulated arousal. Correlations between these wearable circadian metrics and CES-D are small in magnitude and mixed, but the participant’s high amplitude/stability profile is generally aligned with lower depressive symptomatology in many prior studies.

Objective sleep metrics show moderately short median nightly sleep duration (median = 6 hr 52 min, Z = -0.4) and a late but relatively consistent sleep onset time (median sleep start ≈ 01:07, SD ≈ 50 min, Z = -0.72). Sleep duration variability is low (SD = 42 minutes, Z = -1.33), and mean daily napping is absent. The combination of generally adequate subjective sleep quality, low night-to-night variability, and a regular circadian profile reduces concern about sleep-related contributors to elevated depressive symptoms despite a slightly shorter-than-average duration and a late bedtime.

Weighing the evidence holistically: strong, high-importance predictors of CES-D in this dataset (trait anxiety and self-esteem) both point toward lower depressive symptom burden (low STAI, high self-esteem), and other corroborating measures (high self-reported happiness, low perceived stress, good subjective sleep, robust circadian regularity, low resting heart rate, minimal substance use, and adequate academic performance) converge on the same conclusion. A few features that could be interpreted as minor risk factors—late sleep timing and below-average socializing time—are present but are outweighed by multiple stronger indicators associated with relatively low CES-D scores. Because no direct CES-D total score is provided, this is an inference based on multimodal correlates; nevertheless the preponderance and magnitude of protective indicators support classification in the lower half of the sample distribution.

17569,11.0,0.4844559585492228,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological synthesis:
The participant presents a mixed profile in which several robust protective indicators coexist with a few notable risk signals. On the self-report side, trait-level indicators that typically predict lower depressive symptom burden are prominent: self-esteem is relatively high for the sample (RSES Z = 0.68), interpersonal trust and overall health satisfaction are both well above the sample mean (Z = 1.15 and Z = 1.13 respectively), and the STAI–Trait score classifies the participant as “not anxious” (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33). These measures also have relatively strong correlations with CES-D in the study (self-esteem r = -0.71; STAI r = 0.81; trust r = -0.41; health satisfaction r = -0.39), so their directions and magnitudes point toward a lower depressive symptom burden overall. Current self-rated happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), both of which are aligned with small-to-moderate associations with CES-D (happiness r = -0.46; stress r = 0.28) and therefore provide some countervailing signal toward increased symptoms.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac measures indicate a generally well-entrained and physiologically low-arousal baseline. Heart-rate cosinor features show a relatively large amplitude (Z = 0.91) and high interdaily stability (Z = 1.16), and the aggregated hourly deviations reveal pronounced overnight declines and clear daytime peaks (e.g., large positive deviation at 9–10am, Z ≈ 2.05). Resting heart rate is low (47 bpm, Z = -1.33), and mesor is slightly below average (Z = -0.65). Taken together these features reflect stable daily structure and likely good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic physiological arousal—characteristics that, in this sample, are associated with lower CES-D scores or are at least not characteristic of elevated symptom profiles (correlations with CES-D for these metrics are small or near zero).

Sleep measures create the most salient risk signal in the multimodal record. Subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59), and the objective Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is quite short—5 hours 44 minutes (Z = -1.81). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:11) though variability in start time is fairly low (SD ~32 minutes, Z = -1.12). Short, late sleep with evidence of subjective disturbance is commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms; however, in this dataset the direct correlations between some sleep metrics and CES-D are small. Still, the magnitude of sleep restriction (large negative Z) is a clinically meaningful behavioral risk factor that increases the plausibility of elevated mood symptoms despite other protective factors.

Balanced interpretation for CES-D positioning:
Evidence supporting a lower or average CES-D score (bottom half): high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, strong interpersonal trust, high health satisfaction, regular and high-amplitude circadian heart-rate patterns, and low resting heart rate collectively form a coherent signal associated with lower depressive symptomatology in this sample. Several of these measures also have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the expected directions (notably self-esteem and STAI), increasing confidence in this inference.

Evidence supporting a higher CES-D score (top half): short objective sleep duration and disturbed subjective sleep quality constitute the main risk cluster for elevated depressive symptoms. Modestly elevated perceived stress and lower momentary happiness also point toward some symptomatology. These signals are meaningful but less numerous and, in several cases, have weaker correlations with CES-D than the protective indicators.

Holistic judgment:
Weighing the relative magnitude and consistency of the available signals, the protective indicators (particularly high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, strong trust and health satisfaction, robust circadian stability, and low resting heart rate) outweigh the principal risks (short/disturbed sleep, modest stress, lower current happiness). The overall pattern is more consistent with a participant whose CES-D score would fall in the lower or average range of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

77036,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Self-report profile: The participant reports a mixed psychological profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is slightly above the study mean and, given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), represents a notable indicator associated with greater depressive symptomatology. At the same time, global self-esteem is high (RSES = 38, Z = -0.03) and strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D (r = -0.71), which is a robust protective factor against depressive symptoms. Self-rated current happiness is above average (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55; r = -0.46 with CES‑D), also indicating lower symptom burden. Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38; r = 0.28), which would modestly increase risk for depressive symptoms. Trust and health satisfaction are somewhat below average (Trust Z = -0.46; Health Satisfaction Z = -0.53) and their correlations with CES‑D (Trust r ≈ -0.41; Health Satisfaction r ≈ -0.39) suggest these lower ratings modestly align with higher symptom levels. Overall, self-report contains both risk indicators (trait anxiety, stress, lower trust/health satisfaction, PSQI >5) and relatively strong protective signals (high self‑esteem, above-average happiness).

Behavioral habits and activities: The participant reports low frequency of most recreational and social activities (socializing 16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41) and minimal alcohol or drug use; exercise outside of organized sports is infrequent (exercise alone/with others: less than 1–2 times/month, Zs ~ -1.18 and -0.88), although participation in sports 1–2 times/week is reported (Z = 0.91). Reduced daily socializing and infrequent solitary exercise can be associated with higher depressive symptoms, but the participant’s involvement in sports and near-absent substance use are neutral-to-protective behavioral features. The pattern therefore suggests modest behavioral risk related to low day-to-day social engagement and low routine exercise, partly offset by structured sport participation and low substance exposure.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a well-structured rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.53, Z = 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (0.62, Z = 2.49), while intradaily variability is low (0.36, Z = -1.31). These features imply consistent day-to-day cardiovascular timing with little within-day fragmentation, a pattern typically associated with healthier circadian organization and not strongly associated with elevated CES‑D in this sample (correlations near zero or small). Mesor and resting heart rate are modestly above the mean (Mesor 78.5, RHR 61.2; Zs ~ 0.6 and 0.36) and both show small positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting only a weak association between slightly higher average heart rate and depressive symptoms. The hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and afternoon peak (acrophase ~4:14 PM) and do not indicate marked circadian phase delay or blunting that would strongly point to elevated CES‑D.

Sleep metrics: Objective sleep duration is slightly below seven hours (median 6 h 51 min, Z = -0.41) with low night-to-night variability (SD 67 min, Z = -0.77); daytime napping is absent. Subjective sleep quality crosses the common disturbance threshold (PSQI = 6) despite objective sleep consistency. The PSQI classification (“Disturbed Sleep”) combined with the elevated perceived stress suggests some sleep-related complaints that can co-occur with higher depressive symptoms; however, the combination of consistent sleep timing (median start ~ 00:47) and low variability is more characteristic of stable sleep schedules, which is not strongly linked to higher CES‑D here (sleep variability correlations are small). In sum, sleep data present a modest sleep disturbance signal by self-report but objectively show regular timing and limited variability.

Holistic integration and CES‑D positioning: Weighing the multimodal evidence, the participant shows both risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. The strongest risk-related signal is trait anxiety, which in this dataset is a strong correlate of CES‑D, but the participant’s STAI score is only slightly above average rather than extreme. Other modest risk signals include elevated perceived stress, subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI >5), reduced socializing, and somewhat lower interpersonal trust and health satisfaction. Offsetting these, the participant reports high self-esteem and above-average happiness, exhibits well-organized circadian patterns and consistent sleep timing on wearable measures, engages in sports weekly, and has low substance use. Many wearable circadian and sleep features that are typically associated with higher depressive symptoms are absent or in the protective direction (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, consistent sleep timing). Given the balance of moderately protective self-report factors (notably very high self-esteem and positive affect) and strong objective circadian regularity, together with only modest elevations in anxiety and stress, the overall pattern is more consistent with low-to-median depressive symptom burden relative to the study population rather than placing this individual in the upper half of CES‑D scores.

82986,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Multimodal summary — self-report measures:
The participant’s self-report profile contains multiple markers typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI) is well below the cohort mean (score 25; z = -1.61) and perceived stress is below average (PSS z = -0.71). Self-esteem and current happiness are notably above the cohort mean (Rosenberg self-esteem z = 1.66; self-rated happiness z = 1.64), and interpersonal trust is high (z = 1.79). Substance use is absent or minimal across alcohol and recreational drug items. Sleep quality on the PSQI is just above the common clinical cutoff (PSQI = 6) but only modestly elevated relative to the sample (z = -0.33 classification: “Disturbed Sleep”). Taken together, these subjective measures indicate a pattern of relatively high positive affect and self-regard, low trait anxiety and stress, and low reported substance use — features that typically correlate with lower CES-D scores in this population.

Wearable-derived sleep and timing:
Objective sleep and timing data diverge from the participant’s generally positive self-report profile. Median nightly sleep duration measured by Fitbit is short (5 hours 6 minutes; z = -2.60), and median sleep start time is late (approximately 02:24). Sleep-duration variability and sleep start variability are not markedly elevated (SDs ~61–68 minutes, z ≈ -0.48 to -0.75). There are essentially no recorded naps. Short sleep duration and a late sleep schedule are behavioral markers that can be associated with mood disturbance or with circadian misalignment, especially when extreme; in this case the sleep deficit is one of the most prominent objective abnormalities (large negative z for duration) and therefore warrants attention as a possible contributor to daytime functioning even though the participant reports good mood and self-esteem.

Circadian and autonomic metrics:
Heart-rate–derived circadian measures show reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude z = -1.04) and somewhat low interdaily stability (z = -0.66), indicating a blunted and less regular heart-rate rhythm across days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average (z = -0.45) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (z = 0.46). Resting heart rate is moderately elevated relative to the cohort (66.8 bpm; z = 1.03). The hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough with increases during waking hours and an evening peak; however the reduced amplitude and lower stability suggest a less robust circadian organization. Blunted amplitude and decreased stability can be associated with unfavorable mood outcomes in some studies, but the strength of those associations in this dataset is modest (correlations with CES-D for these wearable features are small-to-negligible).

Concordance and discrepant signals relevant to depressive symptoms:
Examining convergent signals, the participant’s strong subjective indices of well-being (high self-esteem, high happiness, low anxiety/stress, low substance use) point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. Objective sleep and circadian measures provide a contrasting signal: very short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and blunted circadian amplitude/stability are risk-relevant features that could increase vulnerability to mood disturbance or impair daytime functioning. Physiological arousal (resting HR slightly elevated) is a minor additional indicator of physiological stress. Importantly, in this dataset the strongest psychometric correlates of CES-D (e.g., trait anxiety correlation 0.81; self-esteem correlation -0.71) suggest that the participant’s favorable scores on those high-weight survey variables are protective against higher CES-D. Wearable feature correlations with CES-D in the cohort are generally small, indicating weaker direct predictive weight for those objective markers here.

Evidence for low/median CES-D (bottom 50):
- Low trait anxiety (STAI z = -1.61) and low perceived stress.
- High self-esteem (z = 1.66), high self-rated happiness (z = 1.64), and high interpersonal trust (z = 1.79).
- Minimal substance use and reasonably active social engagement (1–2 hours socializing).

Evidence for higher CES-D (top 50):
- Very short objective sleep duration (5 h 6 min; z = -2.60) and markedly late sleep timing (median start ~02:24).
- Blunted circadian amplitude (z = -1.04), reduced interdaily stability (z = -0.66), and modestly elevated resting heart rate (z = 1.03).
These objective features are plausible contributors to increased depressive symptoms but their correlations with CES-D in the sample are comparatively small.

Holistic assessment and group assignment:
Weighing the different modalities, subjective measures that strongly covary with depressive symptoms in this cohort (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness) are robust and point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. Objective wearable markers show important areas of concern (particularly extreme short sleep and late timing) that could increase risk, but within this dataset their association with CES-D is weaker than the protective self-report signals. On balance, the evidence supports that this participant would more likely fall in the lower half of the CES-D distribution (i.e., below the cohort median) rather than the top half.

11402,17.0,0.727979274611399,"The self-report profile contains mixed signals with several features that are salient for depressive symptomatology. The participant reports a high trait anxiety score (STAI = 54, Z = 1.25), a variable that in this sample shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81); elevated trait anxiety therefore represents a robust indicator of concurrent depressive symptom risk. At the same time, the participant reports very high self‑esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), a trait that is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r = -0.71) and would be expected to attenuate depressive symptom burden. Subjective happiness is modestly lower than average (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is near sample mean (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17); these mid-range stress/happiness indices are neither strongly protective nor strongly indicative of high depressive burden on their own.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators accentuate risk-relevant patterns. The participant reports limited structured physical activity (sports: not at all; exercise alone/with others 1–2 times/week, Zs ~0.3–0.5) and relatively high sedentary entertainment use (video games Z = 2.47, TV Z = 1.28, internet use Z = 0.85). Alcohol use (beer 1–2x/week, Z = 1.01) is elevated relative to peers. Interpersonal/psychosocial resources such as interpersonal trust (score 3.83, Z = 1.15) and health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.53) show modestly protective or neutral signals, respectively. Taken together, the behavioral profile suggests limited regular exercise and relatively high sedentary recreational time—behaviors that tend to align with increased depressive symptom risk in population studies.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology indicate irregular and delayed sleep timing with short average sleep. Fitbit-derived metrics show a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 19 minutes (Z = -1.07), a median sleep start time around 03:17 AM with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 135 minutes, Z = 1.14), and elevated sleep duration variability (SD = 136 minutes, Z = 0.8). Circadian measures from heart rate show modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.37, Z = -0.33) and low intradaily variability (0.34, Z = -1.45), along with relatively low autocorrelation at 24 h (0.20, Z = -1.03). The pattern is consistent with a late, somewhat irregular sleep schedule (consolidated sleep periods but variable timing), shorter-than-average sleep, and occasional napping (mean daily naps Z = 1.21). These sleep/circadian features (late timing, short duration, irregular schedule) have been associated with depressive symptoms in prior work; correlations in the present dataset for sleep variability and timing are modestly positive with CES-D (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.22; sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20).

Physiological arousal markers show modest elevations in central tendency of heart rate. Resting heart rate (63.4 bpm, Z = 0.62) and MESOR (83.48, Z = 1.30) are above the population mean, while amplitude is around average (Z = 0.4) and the acrophase occurs in the early evening (~6:58 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations reflect expected nocturnal decreases in heart rate and evening increases; correlations between hourly deviations and CES-D are generally small. Slightly higher tonic cardiovascular measures (MESOR and resting HR) have small positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting a weak link between elevated baseline autonomic activity and depressive symptoms here.

Integrating modalities: the strongest single signal favoring elevated depressive symptom burden is the high trait anxiety (STAI) which has a very strong positive association with CES-D in this sample and is elevated for this participant. Sleep timing and short sleep duration, irregular schedule, low levels of structured exercise, and high sedentary recreational use provide additional risk-relevant behavioral corroboration, though each of these shows only modest correlations with CES-D in the dataset. Offsetting these risk signals are robust protective traits—especially very high self-esteem and relatively high interpersonal trust—that are strongly (for self-esteem) or moderately (for trust) inversely related to CES-D. Physiological markers are only mildly suggestive of elevated risk. On balance, the preponderance of risk indicators (notably the highly predictive elevated STAI score together with late/irregular short sleep and low activity) outweighs the protective effects, suggesting that this participant is more likely to fall above the median CES‑D level in the study population.

38610,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures portray a participant with relatively strong positive psychosocial functioning. Trait anxiety (STAI) is low (score 28, Z = -1.31) and the STAI–CES-D correlation in the sample is large and positive (r = 0.81), so this low anxiety score is a robust indicator that depressive symptoms are likely lower for this individual. Self-esteem is markedly elevated versus the study sample (Z = 1.66) and has a strong negative association with CES-D (r = -0.71), which further points toward fewer depressive symptoms. Current happiness and general health satisfaction are also high (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 1.13) and both are inversely associated with CES-D in the sample (happiness r ≈ -0.46; health satisfaction r ≈ -0.39), consistent with lower symptom burden. Academic functioning and social engagement show generally favorable signals (high GPAs; frequent exercise with others, Z = 1.23), and substance use is minimal — all of which are either neutral or protective with respect to depressive symptoms.

Objective wearable and sleep-derived measures present a mixed but not strongly depressogenic profile. Sleep duration is relatively short (median 5 h 46 min; Z = -1.76) and sleep start times are late (median ~02:39), with a modestly elevated PSQI (score 7, classified as disturbed sleep). Short sleep and delayed timing can be risk factors for mood disturbance; however, in this dataset sleep duration shows essentially no association with CES-D (r ≈ -0.01), so the short sleep here does not strongly track with higher depressive scores in the study sample. Heart rate–based circadian metrics indicate a somewhat elevated mesor and resting heart rate (both Z ≈ 1.14) — small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.20) suggest a weak association between higher baseline cardiac activation and depressive symptoms. Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is relatively low (Z = -1.15), while interdaily stability is mildly below average (Z = -0.33) and intradaily variability mildly above average (Z = 0.32); the sample-level correlations between these circadian measures and CES-D are small, indicating limited predictive weight in this cohort.

Integrating subjective and objective data, the strongest, most diagnostically informative signals favor lower depressive symptom burden. High self-esteem and low trait anxiety are particularly influential because they have the largest sample-level correlations with CES-D (strong negative and positive associations, respectively) and the participant’s scores are on the protective side of both measures. Moderate markers of risk (short sleep duration, some objective signs of blunted circadian amplitude and slightly elevated resting heart rate) are present but show weak or inconsistent associations with CES-D in the study data. Overall, the preponderance and magnitude of evidence (notably the powerful inverse relationships of self-esteem and low trait anxiety with CES-D) indicate that this participant’s CES-D score is more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution.

These three measures have comparatively large correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI r = 0.81; SelfEsteem r = -0.71; Happy r = -0.46), and the participant’s scores align with the directions associated with lower CES-D scores. General health satisfaction is also high (7/7, Z = 2.05), which further aligns with lower depressive symptomatology in the cohort. Taken together, the strongest self-report predictors—low trait anxiety and high self-esteem—favor a lower standing on depressive symptom measures.

Behavioral and lifestyle signals: The participant reports minimal substance use and limited sedentary/leisure screen time, which are neutral-to-protective versus peers. Physical activity is mixed: “sports” frequency is above average (1–2 times/week, Z = 0.91) but structured exercise alone is infrequent (Z = -1.18). Socializing minutes are below average (Z = -0.62), but the correlation between socializing and CES-D in this dataset is near zero, suggesting relatively little weight from that variable here. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8, classified as “Disturbed Sleep,” Z = 0.59) is a notable negative indicator; poorer subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptoms. Overall, behavioral data contain a few modest risk factors (subjective sleep disturbance, late bedtimes) but more and stronger protective signals (low substance use, some regular sporting activity).

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a well-structured and relatively robust daily rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.51, Z = 0.83), amplitude (13.98, Z = 1.03), and a clear daytime acrophase (~4:20 PM) suggest consistent daily cardiovascular rhythms across the recording period. Intradaily variability is not elevated (Z = -0.25), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip and higher afternoon arousal—patterns consistent with consolidated nighttime rest and daytime activity. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (60.8 bpm, Z = 0.32). Sleep timing is late (median start ~01:21) with relatively low variability in start time (SD Z = -0.77), and median nightly sleep duration is modestly below seven hours (6 h 53 min, Z = -0.37). Wearable circadian features have small correlations with CES-D in this sample (near zero to small effects), and the participant’s circadian regularity and amplitude are more consistent with lower depressive symptom burden than with a disrupted circadian profile.

Integrated interpretation and weighting of evidence: The strongest available predictors in this dataset (trait anxiety and self-esteem, both with large correlations to CES-D) indicate relatively low depressive symptoms for this participant: low STAI and high self-esteem strongly favor placement below the sample median on CES-D. Additional supporting evidence includes high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, robust and regular heart-rate circadian rhythms, normative resting heart rate, and engagement in sports. Countervailing evidence is limited and of smaller magnitude: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), a late habitual bedtime, and somewhat limited social/leisure engagement are modest risk signals but either correlate weakly with CES-D in this sample or are outweighed by the stronger protective indicators. On balance—giving priority to measures with larger sample correlations and to consistent protective signals across domains—the overall pattern is more compatible with a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

Self-esteem is low (RSES = 28; Z = -1.43) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), a pattern that further points toward greater risk for elevated depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is modestly above average (Current = 4.0; Z = +0.55) and is inversely associated with CES-D (r = -0.46), which may exert some protective influence but does not fully offset the signal from high trait anxiety and low self-esteem. Perceived stress is relatively low for the sample (PSS = 17; Z = -1.26), and health satisfaction and substance use are in ranges that do not suggest clear elevated risk. Subjective sleep quality is in the “disturbed” range (PSQI = 7), a factor commonly linked to depressive symptoms, though its Z-score is near the population mean.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators show several neutral-to-mildly protective patterns alongside behaviors that could modestly relate to mood. The participant engages in some regular exercise (1–2 times per week, both alone and with others) and reports typical socializing (1–2 hours), which are generally protective behavioral features. Alcohol use is infrequent (1–2 times per month) and recreational drug use is absent. Leisure patterns include comparatively high time listening to music (3–4 hours; Z = +1.6), which in this dataset shows a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.25) and may reflect coping or rumination-related behavior depending on context. Overall activity and social engagement do not show the marked withdrawal that often accompanies more severe depressive presentations.

Wearable-derived physiological and sleep data provide an objective behavioral context that is largely mixed and not strongly indicative of extreme depressive symptomatology. Nightly sleep duration is slightly below the study mean (median 6 h 55 min; Z = -0.33) with a modest night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 70 minutes; Z = -0.7) and a late median sleep onset (~01:02), consistent with delayed sleep timing; these features can be associated with mood disturbance but are not extreme. The participant reports virtually no naps. Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than average for the sample (resting HR = 52.4 bpm, mesor ≈ 68.8; both Z ≈ -0.7), suggesting relatively good cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic tone, features that are not typical markers of elevated depressive burden in this dataset. Circadian summary measures show modestly reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.57) but low intradaily fragmentation (Z ≈ -0.25), indicating somewhat less regular day-to-day structure in heart rate rhythms but not marked circadian disruption. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show a clear daytime acrophase (~3:28 PM) with pronounced midday elevations and nocturnal troughs as expected; correlations between these hourly deviations and CES-D are generally weak in this sample.

Weighing the data holistically, the strongest and most diagnostically informative signals in this multimodal profile are the elevated trait anxiety and the relatively low self-esteem, both of which have strong and direct associations with CES-D scores in the study (r = 0.82 and r = -0.71, respectively). Sleep is somewhat disturbed and sleep timing is late, which can contribute to depressive symptoms but are of smaller magnitude here. Objective wearable metrics (resting HR, circadian amplitude, sleep duration) do not provide a strong countervailing signal of severe depressive burden; some features (e.g., low resting HR, moderate exercise and socializing) can be protective or neutral. On balance, the preponderance of evidence—primarily driven by trait anxiety and low self-esteem—points toward a higher depressive symptom burden relative to the study population median.

Trait anxiety (STAI = 40, Z ≈ -0.13) sits near the study mean and is labeled “anxious,” indicating some baseline anxiety proneness but not an extreme elevation; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.81), even moderate anxiety is a relevant contributor to depressive symptom variance. Self-esteem is at the top of its scale (RSES = 40, Z ≈ 0.26), a robust protective signal given the large negative correlation of self-esteem with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71). Perceived stress is noticeably elevated (PSS = 24, Z ≈ 0.65), and subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7, Z ≈ 0.13); both of these factors are commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms and therefore provide moderate risk evidence. Current self-rated happiness is lower than average (score = 3.0, Z ≈ -0.53), and general health satisfaction is relatively low (Z ≈ -0.78), adding modest risk-relevant context.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a largely normative quantity of sleep but a late and somewhat variable sleep schedule. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 h 7 min (Z ≈ -0.08), suggesting adequate total sleep on average, though night-to-night variability is elevated (SD ≈ 108 minutes, small positive z). The median sleep start is late (≈ 02:12 AM), and sleep onset timing variability is present (SD ≈ 72 minutes), which can be behaviorally relevant because late and irregular sleep timing is often linked to poorer mood regulation. Objective circadian features of heart rate indicate modest rhythmic robustness: interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.17) while intradaily variability (fragmentation) is elevated (Z ≈ 0.67). The participant’s mesor and amplitude are both low relative to the sample (mesor Z ≈ -1.95; amplitude Z ≈ -1.21) and resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm, Z ≈ -1.18). These physiological values indicate a lower daytime-average heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude; correlations with CES-D are small to modest (mesor and resting HR r ≈ 0.19), which provides only weak evidence either way for depressive symptom burden.

Integrating modalities, the strongest individual predictors in this dataset (based on sample correlations) are trait anxiety (positive) and self-esteem (negative). In this case self-esteem is a prominent protective factor (high absolute score), while trait anxiety is not extreme. Perceived stress and disturbed subjective sleep add moderate risk signals, and behavioral factors such as low socialization (Z ≈ -1.41) and high internet use (Z ≈ 0.85) align with behavioral patterns often associated with elevated depressive symptoms, though their sample correlations with CES-D are small-to-moderate. Objective physiology provides mixed information: adequate average sleep duration and low resting heart rate are more consistent with lower depressive burden, while increased circadian fragmentation and late sleep timing are modest risk indicators.

Weighing evidence for both sides: evidence supporting a lower or average CES-D placement (bottom 50%) includes notably high self-esteem, near-average trait anxiety, normative total sleep duration, and low resting heart rate—several of which are strongly or moderately associated with lower CES-D in the sample. Evidence supporting a higher CES-D placement (top 50%) includes elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep quality, late and variable sleep timing, low socializing, and high intradaily variability; however, many of these risk indicators have smaller correlations with CES-D in the sample than self-esteem and trait anxiety. Overall, the balance of strong protective signals (particularly the maximal self-esteem score) against moderate risk signals suggests this participant’s overall depressive symptom burden is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

29885,17.0,0.727979274611399,"Summary of self-report psychological measures:
The participant reports a mix of modest affective risk and protective factors. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, z = 0.17) is slightly above the study mean and the trait measure is strongly correlated with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), indicating that anxiety proneness is an important correlate of depressive symptoms in the cohort. Self-esteem (RSES = 33, z = -0.73) is below average and has a strong negative association with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), suggesting lower self-worth as another relevant vulnerability. Subjective happiness is above average (current = 4.0, z = 0.55) and perceived stress is lower than average (PSS = 20, z = -0.44), both of which point toward adaptive mood and coping relative to the sample. The PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score 7), a mild signal of sleep-related difficulty that can relate to mood symptoms, though its z-score is near the mean.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns:
Behaviorally, the participant shows several protective routines. Exercise frequency is high (exercising alone and with others three+ times per week; z ≈ 1.1–1.2) and BMI and resting-heart-rate are consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Social time with friends is present (1–2 hours daily) and recreational substance use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2x/week) with no recreational drug use. However, the participant reports a relatively high amount of time in a sedentary hobby (1–2 hours, z = 1.41), which is a small risk vector for lower activity diversity. Overall, lifestyle indicators are more protective than they are risk-laden.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian, and physiological signals:
Wearable data indicate a highly regular circadian structure with relatively strong interdaily stability (z = 1.0), low intradaily variability (z = -0.81), and high amplitude (z = 1.25), consistent with a stable, consolidated daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.2 bpm, z = -0.59), supporting the idea of good cardiorespiratory fitness. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:57) but tightly regular (sleep start SD ≈ 35 minutes, z ≈ -1.06) and sleep duration is near 7 hours (median 6 h 56 min, z = -0.31) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD z = -1.5). Hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and a pronounced evening elevation around 9–10 pm (9–10pm deviation z = 1.9), which may reflect late-evening arousal or activity but does not appear to disrupt sleep regularity. Napping is rare.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptomatology:
Balancing the data, the participant presents a mixture of modest affective vulnerabilities (slightly elevated trait anxiety and below-average self-esteem, both of which are strongly associated with higher CES-D in the sample) against several behavioral and physiological protective factors (regular circadian rhythms, consistent sleep duration, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, lower perceived stress, and above-average momentary happiness). The subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and the late sleep timing are potential contributors to mood risk, but the objective wearable data show stable sleep schedules and low variability, which mitigate concerns about fragmented or irregular sleep as a persistent driver of depressive symptoms. Correlational guidance in the dataset flags anxiety and self-esteem as especially predictive of CES-D, but the participant’s absolute values on those measures are only mildly deranged rather than extreme.

Evidence for lower/median CES-D (bottom 50%):
- Regular, high-amplitude circadian rhythms, low intradaily variability, and high interdaily stability — patterns typically associated with lower mood disturbance in ambulatory studies.
- Frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, and above-average health satisfaction and current happiness.
- Low perceived stress and consistent sleep duration/night-to-night stability.

Evidence for higher CES-D (top 50%):
- Trait anxiety modestly above average and self-esteem below average; both measures have strong sample correlations with CES-D, so they represent nontrivial risk factors.
- PSQI indicates subjective sleep disturbance and the participant has a late sleep schedule, which can relate to mood symptoms even when sleep is regular.

Holistic conclusion:
Weighing the relative magnitude of protective versus risk signals, the participant’s behavioral and physiological profile is predominantly favorable (stable circadian rhythm, regular sleep, consistent exercise, low RHR, lower perceived stress, and above-average current happiness). The primary psychological risk indicators (trait anxiety and reduced self-esteem) are present but moderate in magnitude. On balance, the combined evidence supports depressive symptom burden that is more likely in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

79167,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a profile broadly consistent with low depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety is low (STAI score z = -1.71), perceived stress is markedly low (PSS z = -3.16), and state happiness is relatively high (z = 1.64). Self‑esteem is elevated relative to the sample (z = 1.24) and overall health satisfaction is high (z = 2.05). The PSQI score is at the threshold for “good sleep” (score = 5, z = -0.8), suggesting few subjective sleep complaints. These survey variables are each correlated with CES‑D in expected directions in the sample (e.g., anxiety positively, self‑esteem and happiness negatively), and the participant’s values on these key predictors are systematically protective against higher CES‑D scores.

Objective sleep and wearable-derived physiology further support a low symptom interpretation. Fitbit-recorded median nightly sleep duration is long relative to peers (8 h 11 m, z = 1.25) with low night-to-night variability (sleep SD z = -0.32) and few naps (z = -0.86). Resting heart rate is comparatively low (52.7 bpm, z = -0.65), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and absence of chronic arousal. Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations; there are pronounced morning and midday positive deviations (notably around 6–8 AM and near noon) and negative deviations across sleeping hours, which aligns with typical sleep–wake physiology rather than blunted or inverted patterns associated with clinical circadian disruption.

Circadian summary metrics are mixed but not strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology. Non‑parametric interdaily stability is below average (z = -1.07), and intradaily variability is modestly elevated (z = 0.74), suggesting somewhat less rigid day-to-day regularity and a degree of within‑day fragmentation. Parametric features show a reduced amplitude (z = -1.03) and a mesor slightly below the sample mean (z = -0.81). However, sample correlations provided between these circadian/variability metrics and CES‑D are small or near zero in this dataset, indicating limited predictive weight for depressive symptoms here. The wearable-derived signals therefore contain a few deviations from the most regular circadian patterns, but these deviations are neither extreme nor strongly linked to higher CES‑D in the study correlations.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are overall protective. The participant exercises frequently (alone and with others, sports three times weekly or more; z-scores > 1), reports modest social contact (1–2 hours socializing, near average), and engages in little recreational drug use or excessive sedentary media time. Alcohol use is occasional (1–2 times per week for beer and wine/liquor) but not extreme. Academic performance (GPA values reported) is strong. Taken together, these behavioral features typically associate with lower depressive symptoms in young adult samples.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: strong protective self-report indicators (very low perceived stress, low trait anxiety, high happiness and self‑esteem), objective restorative sleep duration and stable sleep timing, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and socially normative behaviors all point toward a lower CES‑D score relative to the study population. Although there are modest reductions in circadian regularity (interdaily stability, amplitude) and a mildly elevated intradaily variability, the correlations provided indicate these circadian features have little to no association with CES‑D in the sample and do not outweigh the multiple, concordant protective signals. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with placement in the lower half of the CES‑D distribution.

22455,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Self-report indicators of mood and trait affect point primarily toward a relatively low burden of depressive symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) is well below the sample mean; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this cohort (r ≈ 0.82), this low anxiety score is a substantial signal in favor of lower depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem is elevated (Rosenberg score reported high, Z = 1.10) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), further supporting lower depressive symptom levels. Current self-rated happiness is also high (Current = 5.0, Z = 1.64; r ≈ -0.46 with CES-D) and health satisfaction is elevated (Z ≈ 1.96; r ≈ -0.39), both consistent with lower depressive symptoms. These survey measures are robust predictors in the study correlations and collectively provide multiple convergent signals associated with reduced depressive symptom burden.

There are nonetheless risk-relevant self-report features that partially counter the protective signals. Perceived stress is high (PSS = 30, Z = 2.28), and although its correlation with CES-D is modest (r ≈ 0.29), elevated stress levels represent an important proximal risk factor for mood symptoms. Interpersonal trust is notably low (Z = -2.71) and correlates moderately with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.42); low trust may reflect or contribute to social vulnerability that can elevate depressive symptoms. Behavioral patterns show frequent solitary exercise (exercised alone three times/week or more; Z ≈ 1.07), minimal substance use (no alcohol/other drugs), and moderate social time with friends (2–3 hours/day, Z ≈ 0.95). These activity patterns (regular exercise, low substance use, and some social contact) are either neutral or modestly protective with respect to CES-D based on cohort correlations.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology present a mixed picture with limited direct association with CES-D in this dataset. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, classified as “good sleep”, Z ≈ -0.8) is near the cohort average, but objective sleep duration is on the shorter side (median 6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33) with relatively high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 142 minutes, Z ≈ 0.94). Circadian rhythm features derived from heart rate show reduced rhythm amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -1.52) and lower MESOR (Z ≈ -1.04), with interdaily stability also below average (Z ≈ -0.90) — a pattern consistent with a somewhat damped and less-regular circadian profile. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced early-morning elevations (large positive deviations around 5–7 AM, Z-scores up to ~6.2) and reduced evening/night deviations, which may reflect early morning arousal or activity on many days. However, correlations between these wearable circadian/sleep metrics and CES-D are small in this sample, so these physiological features should be considered secondary to the stronger self-report predictors.

Integrative interpretation: weighing evidence across modalities, the strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset indicate relatively low depressive symptom burden. Low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem and happiness, elevated health satisfaction, regular physical activity, and absence of substance use are all robustly associated with lower CES-D scores in this cohort. Contrasting risk signals — notably very high perceived stress and markedly low interpersonal trust, along with some objective sleep shortness and dampened circadian amplitude — introduce important caveats and may increase vulnerability under stress, but they do not outweigh the convergent protective signals from the trait and affect measures. On balance, the multi-modal profile is more consistent with a CES-D score in the lower half of the study population distribution.

57443,19.0,0.7616580310880829,"Self-report profile: The participant’s survey data present a mixed but overall low-to-moderate affective symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is in the mid-range (Z = -0.13) and the instrument is highly correlated with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), but the absolute value here is not elevated relative to peers. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39; Z = 0.11) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which is a protective signal. Current self-reported happiness is above average (score = 4, Z = 0.55). Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25; Z = 0.92) and shows a modest positive association with CES-D (r = 0.28), indicating a potential stress-related vulnerability. Other lifestyle indicators: low substance use, low frequency of exercise, modest social time (1–2 hours daily), and high time listening to music; trust in others is lower than average (Z = -0.78). Overall, subjective measures show some risk (elevated stress, reduced interpersonal trust, low exercise) but also several protective features (high self-esteem, above-average happiness, limited substance use).

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate summary: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a reasonably robust and regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.50; Z = 0.75) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.46; Z = 1.15) are above-average, suggesting consistent day-to-day timing of physiological activity. Intradaily variability is near the population mean (0.55; Z = 0.03), and amplitude is moderately elevated (12.91; Z = 0.69), indicating a discernible day–night difference in heart rate. The cosinor mesor (80.19; Z = 0.85) is somewhat higher than average while resting heart rate (61.2 bpm; Z = 0.36) is slightly above mean but within typical range; together these indicate normal nocturnal troughs and daytime rises rather than blunted or flattened rhythms. The acrophase (≈4:40 PM) and the hourly aggregated deviations show expected low heart rates overnight (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and clear positive deviations in mid-afternoon and early evening (notably ~1–3 PM and ~6–8 PM). Given these features and the low intradaily variability, the physiological signal reflects a coherent circadian structure rather than the disrupted rhythms often associated with more severe depressive symptomatology.

Sleep behavior and stability: Objective sleep metrics are broadly consonant with adequate sleep and regular timing. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 14 minutes (Z = 0.06), within normative ranges for the sample, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is low (SD = 42 minutes; Z = -1.33), indicating consistent sleep duration. Median sleep start time is shortly after midnight (00:24), with modest variability across nights (SD ≈ 81 minutes; Z ≈ -0.03). The PSQI score is 5 (Z = -0.8), classified as “good sleep” in this dataset. The participant reports essentially no naps. These objective and subjective sleep indicators (adequate duration, low variability, and overall good subjective sleep) are generally protective in relation to depression risk.

Integration with CES-D–relevant predictors and likely symptom burden: Several available measures that are strongly associated with CES-D in this study point toward lower depressive symptom burden for this participant. High self-esteem (strong negative correlate with CES-D) and congruent positive affect/happiness are notable protective factors. Wearable-derived markers—regular circadian structure (high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation), clear amplitude, consistent sleep duration and timing—are also features more commonly observed in lower-depression profiles. Countervailing signals include elevated perceived stress (Z ≈ 0.92) and modest reductions in interpersonal trust and exercise frequency; trait anxiety is present at a mid-range but not elevated relative to peers. Many of the wearable heart-rate features and sleep measures have only small or negligible correlations with CES-D in this sample (correlations near zero to small positive), and those that are more predictive (STAI, self-esteem) show values here that, taken together, suggest more resilience than risk.

Conclusion: On balance, the multilevel pattern (high self-esteem and reported happiness, adequate and regular sleep, coherent circadian physiology, low substance use) outweighs the moderate risk indicators (elevated perceived stress, low exercise, lower trust). The overall evidence points toward a CES-D score that is more likely in the lower half of the study distribution.

94579,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"Self-report profile and psychosocial risk/protective factors:
The participant’s survey responses present a mix of protective and risk-relevant indicators for depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety on the STAI is modestly elevated (score = 44, Z = 0.27), and the STAI–CES-D correlation provided is large and positive (r = 0.81), indicating that higher anxiety scores in this sample are strongly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Countervailing that risk signal, Rosenberg self-esteem is relatively high (score = 37, Z = -0.17), with a strong negative sample correlation to CES-D (r = -0.71), which suggests a robust protective relationship between this participant’s self-esteem and lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is low (PSS = 17, Z = -1.26), and health satisfaction is above-average (score = 5, Z = 0.55), both of which are consistent with lower symptom burden. Behavioral patterns captured in surveys—frequent exercise (three times/week or more; exercise Z-scores > 1.0), regular socializing (2–3 hours/day, Z ≈ 0.95), low substance use, and substantial reading and music listening—are generally protective or neutral with respect to CES-D in this dataset. Current self-reported happiness is somewhat below average (current = 3.0, Z = -0.53), which aligns with a modest negative relation to CES-D (r = -0.46), but on balance the self-report psychosocial profile contains more indicators linked to lower depressive symptom burden than to high burden.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures:
Objective sleep and circadian metrics identify notable irregularity and lateness in sleep timing. Median sleep duration is 6 h 38 min (Z = -0.69), which is somewhat shorter than typical for this population, and the standard deviation of nightly sleep duration is very large (SD = 242 minutes, Z = 3.21), indicating marked night-to-night variability. Median sleep start time is late (about 02:07 AM) with substantial variability in sleep onset (SD Z = 1.54). Mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z = -0.86). Circadian summary measures from heart rate are broadly within normal-to-moderately-structured ranges: interdaily stability is above average (0.49, Z = 0.67), intradaily variability is near average (0.52, Z = -0.18), mesor and resting heart rate are slightly below the study mean (mesor ≈ 72, Z = -0.27; resting HR = 57.6, Z = -0.07), and amplitude and acrophase (peak around 4:17 PM) indicate a preserved day–night rhythm. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal declines and daytime elevations (largest positive deviations mid-morning to mid-afternoon), with a relatively low early-evening deviation (6–7 pm). Taken together, the wearable data indicate preserved circadian structure but with late and highly variable sleep timing—features that have been associated in prior work with greater mood symptom risk even when core circadian rhythmicity remains detectable.

Integration and implications for depressive symptom burden:
When integrated, the multimodal data suggest more evidence of lower-than-average depressive symptom burden than of elevated burden. Strong protective signals include high self-esteem (strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in this sample), low perceived stress, frequent exercise and social engagement, low substance use, and generally intact circadian rhythm metrics (interdaily stability, amplitude, mesor, and resting HR near or below the mean). Contrasting risk signals are modest: trait anxiety is somewhat elevated (STAI = 44) and correlates strongly with CES-D in this dataset, current happiness is somewhat below average, and objective sleep shows short average duration and unusually high night-to-night variability with late sleep onset—sleep patterns that are associated with increased depressive symptoms in many studies and are modestly positively correlated with CES-D here. The magnitude of the protective factors (notably the strong inverse relationship between self-esteem and CES-D, and robust engagement in exercise and social activities) appears larger and more consistent than the risk signals, which are either modest in magnitude (slightly elevated anxiety) or circumscribed to sleep timing/regularity rather than pervasive functional impairment.

Overall assessment relative to the study distribution:
Balancing the modality-specific indicators and their sample correlations with CES-D, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s depressive symptom burden is likely in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not among the higher-CES-D participants). The strongest individual predictors in this dataset point toward lower CES-D (high self-esteem, low perceived stress, active lifestyle), and while late/irregular sleep and modestly elevated trait anxiety warrant consideration as vulnerability factors, they do not, in combination with the other data, outweigh the protective pattern.

29257,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"Self-report measures indicate a profile more consistent with lower-than-average affective distress. Trait anxiety (STAI-T = 31, Z = -1.02) is below the sample mean and interpretable as low anxiety proneness; this measure also has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r ≈ 0.81), so the low STAI score argues strongly for lower depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES-derived Z = 1.1; study correlation with CES-D r ≈ -0.71), which also predicts lower depressive symptoms. Perceived stress (PSS ≈ 19, Z = -0.71) and subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4, classified as good sleep, Z = -1.26) are both below sample means, further supporting a low-to-average symptom load. Other psychosocial items — relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 0.72), moderate social activity, and low reported recreational drug use — align with a generally adaptive psychosocial profile. A few behavioral indicators diverge from a strictly “low-risk” pattern (frequent music listening, Z = 2.06, which shows a modest positive correlation with CES-D), but these are secondary and small in relation to the stronger protective signals from STAI and self-esteem.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data show mixed signals. Sleep quantity is adequate on average: median nightly sleep ~7 h 49 min (Z = 0.79), and naps are essentially absent, both consistent with normative sleep duration. However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD ≈ 151 minutes, Z = 1.14) and sleep onset is relatively late (median start ≈ 01:32), suggesting irregular sleep timing. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate show reduced interdaily stability (value 0.26, Z = -1.23) and a lower amplitude of the heart rate rhythm (amplitude Z = -0.75), consistent with a somewhat weakened or less regular circadian structure. Resting heart rate (≈59 bpm) and mesor are within typical ranges, and hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and afternoon elevations; these cardiovascular markers do not indicate overt physiological arousal that would typically accompany higher depressive symptom burden. In sum, objective data show generally sufficient sleep duration but increased variability and modest circadian irregularity — possible contributors to risk but alone not determinative.

Integrated interpretation weighing modalities: the strongest predictors available in this dataset point toward lower depressive symptomatology. The two survey measures most strongly correlated with CES-D in this study — trait anxiety (positive correlation) and self-esteem (negative correlation) — both indicate a low-risk profile for this participant. Subjective sleep quality is good and perceived stress is below average, reinforcing that signal. Wearable evidence does introduce caution: elevated night-to-night sleep variability and diminished circadian stability/amplitude are known to associate with mood disturbance and could reflect behavioral patterns (late and irregular sleep timing) that increase vulnerability over time. However, the magnitude of those wearable deviations is moderate and is not accompanied by physiological markers of elevated arousal (resting HR is normative). Secondary behavioral indicators that weakly correlate with higher CES-D (heavy music listening) are present but have small effect sizes.

Evidence for lower/median CES-D (bottom 50): low trait anxiety (strong inverse predictor), high self-esteem (strong inverse predictor), good subjective sleep quality, below-average perceived stress, normative resting HR and overall adequate sleep duration. Evidence for higher CES-D (top 50): increased night-to-night sleep duration variability, later average sleep onset, reduced interdaily stability and lower HR amplitude (circadian weakening), and one behavioral correlate (high music listening) modestly associated with higher CES-D. Overall weighting of the evidence places greater emphasis on the strong, highly correlated self-report predictors (low STAI and high self-esteem) and good subjective sleep; wearable irregularities are notable but moderate and do not override the dominant protective signals.

Conclusion: based on the balance of self-report and wearable indicators, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

49539,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a profile more consistent with lower affective symptom burden than with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant reports very low trait anxiety (STAI = 23, Z = -1.81) and relatively high self-regard (SelfEsteem Z = +0.96), both of which show strong correlations with CES‑D in this sample (STAI r ≈ +0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71) and therefore represent substantial protective signals against higher CES‑D scores. Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS Z ≈ +0.1) and momentary happiness is modestly below average (Happy Z ≈ -0.53), but neither of these deviations is large relative to the stronger, more CES‑D–predictive indices noted above. The participant also reports above-average satisfaction with physical health (Health Satisfaction Z ≈ +0.8) and essentially no substance use, which are additional factors generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and social activity patterns are mixed but do not strongly indicate elevated depressive symptoms. The participant engages in sports at a positive frequency (1–2 times per week, Z ≈ +0.91) while reporting very little exercise alone or with others (both Z < -0.8). Time spent socializing and in typical recreational sedentary hobbies is below the sample mean (socializing Z ≈ -0.62; sedentary hobby Z ≈ -0.96). These patterns suggest some structured physical activity but relatively low routine social/leisure engagement, which can be a mild risk factor for depressive symptoms; however, correlations between these specific activity items and CES‑D are small in this dataset, so their predictive weight is limited.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data show a combination of generally adequate, regular sleep duration with features that could modestly increase risk. Objective median sleep duration is within the typical range (7 h 20 m, Z ≈ +0.18) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep-start time are lower than average (sleep SD Zs ≈ -1.47 and -0.96), indicating relatively stable sleep quantity and timing. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) meets the study criterion for “disturbed sleep,” however, which signals some perceived sleep difficulty not captured by duration alone. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Z ≈ +0.75) alongside elevated intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +2.01). Elevated IV indicates more fragmentation or irregularity in activity/physiology within days; while IV’s direct correlation with CES‑D is small in this sample, the combination of subjective sleep disturbance and within-day fragmentation suggests circadian or arousal patterns that could modestly relate to mood symptoms.

Cardiovascular and hourly heart-rate patterns largely point away from elevated depressive symptom burden. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are notably low relative to the sample (resting HR Z ≈ -1.23; mesor Z ≈ -1.57), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low baseline autonomic arousal; in this dataset, higher resting HR has a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ +0.19), so the participant’s low resting HR is a weak protective marker. The hourly aggregate deviations show a healthy nocturnal decline in heart rate (negative deviations across the early morning hours) and marked daytime increases, with an acrophase in the early evening (≈5:26 PM). One unusually large positive deviation around 11:00 PM–12:00 AM (Z ≈ +4.79) suggests episodic late-night arousal or measurement artifact; taken with the late median sleep-start time (~1:45 AM), this may reflect late-evening activity or heightened physiological arousal before sleep, aligning with the self-reported disturbed sleep.

Integrating modalities and weighting the strongest predictors, the balance of evidence favors a lower overall depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. The most influential measures for CES‑D in this dataset—trait anxiety and self-esteem—both point toward lower CES‑D (very low STAI, above-average self-esteem). Objective physiology (low resting HR, regular sleep duration) and absence of substance use further support lower risk. The main countervailing signals are subjective sleep disturbance, late sleep timing with occasional late-night arousal, limited routine socializing, and high intraday fragmentation; these indicate modest vulnerabilities but are of smaller magnitude or weaker correlation to CES‑D in this sample. Overall, the multimodal profile is more consistent with placement in the lower half of the CES‑D distribution for this study population.

63904,30.0,0.9119170984455959,"Self-report traits and symptom indicators:
The participant reports multiple trait and state measures that, in aggregate, align with elevated affective symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 53, z ≈ +1.16) is well above the study mean and the STAI–trait score has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), indicating that this elevation is a robust predictor of higher depressive symptom scores in the cohort. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 30, z ≈ -1.15) and the RSES has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), which likewise points toward greater depressive symptom burden when self-esteem is reduced. Current self-rated happiness is also low (score = 2.0, z ≈ -1.61; happiness correlates negatively with CES-D, r = -0.46). Perceived stress is modestly above average (PSS = 23, z ≈ +0.38; r = 0.28), and overall health satisfaction is slightly below average. These self-report indices—particularly the combination of elevated trait anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and low reported happiness—are the strongest survey-based signals that, within this dataset, align with a higher CES-D score.

Sleep behavior and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate short nighttime sleep (median 5 h 49 min; z ≈ -1.69) with a relatively low night-to-night duration variability (SD ≈ 30 minutes; z ≈ -1.61). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:34) and sleep start shows moderate variability (SD ≈ 60 minutes). The participant’s PSQI score of 6 meets a conventional threshold for disturbed subjective sleep. Short sleep duration and late sleep timing are commonly associated with affective symptoms; however, in this dataset median sleep duration has near-zero correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.01), reducing confidence that short sleep alone in this sample predicts higher CES-D. Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively robust daily rhythm: interdaily stability (z ≈ +1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 h (z ≈ +1.06) are above average, amplitude and mesor are near the sample mean, and intradaily variability is only modestly elevated (z ≈ +0.6). These wearable-derived circadian features suggest a reasonably regular rest–activity/physiological rhythm across days, which, within this cohort, might be relatively protective against depressive symptom burden despite short sleep and late timing.

Behavioral patterns and social/activity context:
The participant reports minimal engagement with substances and recreational drug use (all “not at all”), and low participation in exercise or organized sports (all “not at all”), which could reduce some behavioral buffers (exercise is typically negatively associated with depressive symptoms, though here exercise variables have weak correlations with CES-D). Social time is notable: the participant reports socializing with friends 2–3 hours per day (z ≈ +0.95), which is relatively high and potentially protective; the correlation of socializing with CES-D in this sample is near zero (r ≈ -0.02), so its predictive value is limited here. Internet use is above average (2–3 hours, z ≈ +0.85). Interpersonal trust is low (z ≈ -2.07), a potential social vulnerability that correlates modestly with CES-D (r ≈ -0.40). Overall, behavioral data present a mixed picture: relative social contact and low substance use could mitigate risk, whereas low exercise, low interpersonal trust, and limited leisure engagement in other domains are not supportive.

Physiological arousal and diurnal heart-rate patterning:
Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor indicate expected overnight heart-rate suppression (largest negative deviations between ~1–6 AM) and daytime elevations concentrated mid-afternoon to early evening. Resting heart rate is typical for this population (≈ 60.5 bpm, z ≈ +0.28). There are no unusually high nocturnal heart-rate elevations or blunted daytime variation that would suggest marked physiological dysregulation; circadian amplitude and mesor are near average. Taken together, heart-rate physiology implies a generally intact diurnal arousal pattern rather than clear autonomic signs of elevated depressive symptom burden.

Synthesis and likelihood of elevated CES-D:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest indicators supporting elevated depressive symptoms are the high trait anxiety (STAI) and low self-esteem, both of which have large correlations with CES-D in this sample and are substantially deviant from the cohort mean. Low self-reported happiness further reinforces this signal. Objective wearables provide a mixed picture: short nocturnal sleep and late sleep timing are risk factors but show weak predictive correlations with CES-D here, while relatively high interdaily stability and normal heart-rate amplitude suggest preserved circadian regularity, which may lessen symptom severity. Behavioral factors (low exercise, low interpersonal trust) add modest risk, whereas frequent socializing and low substance use are potential protective factors. On balance, because the measures most strongly correlated with CES-D (trait anxiety and self-esteem) are both in the direction associated with higher depressive symptoms and are substantially deviant from the sample mean, the cumulative evidence favors placement in the higher half of the CES-D distribution for this study population.

20335,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"Self-report measures indicate a constellation of protective psychological features. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 23, Z = -1.81), relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66), above-average self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64), and below-average perceived stress (PSS Z = -0.71). Health satisfaction is elevated (Z = 1.3) and sleep quality by PSQI is at or just below the common clinical cutoff (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8, classified here as “Good Sleep”). These survey-derived indicators align with profile features that correlate negatively with CES-D in the study (e.g., STAI positively correlates with CES-D, r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem correlates negatively, r ≈ -0.71), and the participant’s scores on those measures point toward lower depressive symptom burden relative to the sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle data likewise show several supportive patterns. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; exercise Z = 1.07) and substantial social time (socializing 3–4 hours, Z = 1.74). Substance and recreational drug use are minimal to moderate (beer and wine/liquor use in low-to-moderate ranges; no recreational or non-prescribed drug use). Leisure patterns include some elevated sedentary hobby time and video game use (sedentary hobby Z = 2.01; video games Z = 1.71), which are potential behavioral risk correlates in small effect sizes in the sample but are not strongly associated with CES-D here (correlations small, typically |r| < 0.2). Overall, frequency of exercise and social engagement are prominent protective behaviors in this profile.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics suggest relatively regular circadian organization and low baseline autonomic arousal. Interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ 0.9) are above the sample mean, indicating consistent day-to-day structure in heart-rate rhythms; intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.81) but not extreme. Resting heart rate is low (55 bpm, Z = -0.37), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal. The cosinor-derived MESOR is slightly above average (MESOR Z = 0.57) and amplitude is moderately elevated (Z = 0.9), with acrophase (~6:06 PM) indicating a typical evening peak. Wearable hourly deviations show a pronounced positive deviation near midnight (12–1am, Z = 3.66) and broadly negative deviations through early morning, consistent with a late and concentrated activity window rather than fragmented nighttime physiology.

Sleep timing and duration present a mixed but interpretable pattern: median sleep start time is late (about 01:54 AM) yet relatively consistent (start-time SD Z = -1.24), and median sleep duration is somewhat shorter than average (6 h 35 m, Z = -0.74) but not severely reduced. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI) sits at the common cutoff but here is classified as “Good Sleep.” The combination of a consistent late sleep schedule, moderate short sleep duration, and stable circadian rhythmicity suggests the participant may follow a stable evening chronotype (typical of many students) rather than experiencing irregular or highly disrupted sleep that often accompanies higher depressive symptom burden.

Integrative interpretation and comparison to CES-D distribution: across modalities this participant shows multiple indicators associated with lower depressive symptomatology—markedly low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, low perceived stress, strong social engagement, regular exercise, consistent circadian rhythmicity, and low resting heart rate. Risk signals are present but modest: a late habitual bedtime with somewhat shortened total sleep and relatively high sedentary leisure time. The survey metrics that most strongly correlate with CES-D in the sample (e.g., STAI, self-esteem, happiness) are favorable for this participant, while wearable circadian measures do not indicate the kind of disruption that typically tracks with higher depression scores. On balance, the multimodal evidence is more consistent with a below-median (lower) CES-D score than with an elevated score.

35031,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Self-report measures indicate a profile more consistent with relatively low depressive symptom burden. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 27, z = -1.41) and a relatively high global self-esteem score (RSES reported as 43, z = 0.68), both of which have strong population-level correlations with CES-D in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71). Perceived stress is below the study mean (PSS = 18, z = -0.98) and subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z = -0.80) is classified as “good” in this dataset. Behavioral indicators from surveys show active social engagement (socializing 2–3 hours, z = 0.95) and consistent academic functioning (high GPAs), which are conventionally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Together, the direction and magnitude of these self-report and behavioral variables—particularly the combination of low anxiety, higher self-esteem, low perceived stress, and substantial social contact—strongly favor a lower CES-D score relative to the study population.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures provide a mixed but not strongly contradictory picture. Nighttime sleep quantity is above average (median 8 h 3 min, z = 1.08) with modest night-to-night variability; nap frequency is low (0.14/day, z = 0.82). These sleep metrics are generally neutral-to-protective with respect to depressive symptoms in this dataset (median sleep duration correlation with CES-D ≈ 0.0). In contrast, heart-rate–based circadian metrics show notable physiological irregularities: low interdaily stability (0.19, z = -1.81), low autocorrelation at 24 hours (z ≈ -1.87), reduced amplitude (5.05, z = -1.85), and an elevated mesor and resting heart rate (mesor 82.2 bpm z = 1.13; resting HR 75.5 bpm z = 2.06). These heart-rate features indicate relatively blunted circadian amplitude and higher baseline cardiac activity. However, in this sample the wearable circadian features show only weak correlations with CES-D (resting HR r ≈ 0.2; amplitude r ≈ -0.11; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.01), meaning that while physiological dysregulation may be present, it provides only modest additional evidence for elevated depressive symptoms compared with the stronger self-report signals.

Integrating self-report, behavioral, and wearable data yields a coherent assessment: psychosocial and symptom self-reports (low trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, low perceived stress, good subjective and objective sleep duration, active social engagement, intact academic performance) provide relatively strong evidence for lower depressive symptom burden compared with the study cohort. Physiological signals (elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude/stability) are potential risk or stress markers but have smaller effect sizes and weaker observed correlations with CES-D in this dataset, so they do not outweigh the protective/self-report indicators. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports that this participant’s CES-D score is likely in the lower half of the study distribution.

88185,7.0,0.31865284974093266,"Self-report measures indicate a psychological profile that is generally inconsistent with high depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI-T = 29, Z = -1.22) is low relative to the sample and STAI–Trait shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), so the participant’s low anxiety level suggests lower CES-D risk. Self-esteem is above the sample mean (RSES Z = 0.82) and self-esteem is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), again pointing toward lower depressive symptoms. Current self-rated happiness is relatively high (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and perceived stress is modest (PSS Z = -0.44); both of these patterns (higher happiness, lower stress) align with lower expected CES-D scores.

Health behaviors and lifestyle reports largely support resilience factors. The participant reports no substance use, regular solo exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), and moderate social activity (2–3 hours of socializing; Z = 0.95). Interpersonal trust is above average (Z = 0.83), a variable that correlates negatively with CES-D (r = -0.41). High frequency of listening to music (>4 hours, Z = 2.06) is a notable outlier in daily activities; this variable shows a small positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.26), so it is a potential marker to monitor but, in isolation, does not outweigh the several protective behavioral indicators.

Subjective and wearable sleep metrics show some inconsistencies that warrant attention but are moderate in magnitude. The PSQI score of 6 classifies as disturbed sleep (just above the common cutoff), and median nightly sleep duration is somewhat shorter than the sample mean (6 h 37 min, Z = -0.7). The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 02:25), and night-to-night variability in sleep timing is moderate (sleep start SD ~88 minutes). Objective nap frequency is essentially zero. In sum, there is evidence of late and slightly shortened sleep with mild subjective disturbance, which could modestly elevate CES-D risk, but these sleep features are not extreme.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular indicators are consistent with a well-entrained and physiologically regulated daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.57, Z = 1.33) and amplitude is higher than average (Z = 1.06), while intradaily variability is low (Z = -0.32); together these suggest consistent day-to-day structure and stronger day/night differentiation in heart rate. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.3 bpm, Z = -0.1), and the hourly deviations show an expected pronounced nocturnal decline and afternoon/evening rises with an acrophase around 5:00 PM. These circadian and autonomic patterns generally align with lower depressive symptomatology or more intact physiological regulation rather than the blunted rhythms sometimes observed with higher depressive symptoms.

Integrated evaluation weighing all modalities favors placement in the lower half of the CES-D distribution. Strong contributors to a lower expected CES-D score include low trait anxiety (strongly predictive), above-average self-esteem (strong inverse predictor), higher self-reported happiness, low substance use, regular exercise, higher interpersonal trust, and robust circadian stability and amplitude. Countervailing signals are relatively minor: mild subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), somewhat short and late sleep timing, and an elevated daily music-listening behavior that has a small positive correlation with CES-D. Overall, the magnitude and consistency of protective signals across psychological self-report and objective physiology outweigh the modest risk signals from sleep, supporting a probabilistic placement in the lower half of the sample distribution for depressive symptoms.

35344,28.0,0.8756476683937824,"Trait-level self-report and symptom measures indicate a profile consistent with elevated internalizing symptomatology. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 62; z = 2.05) is markedly high relative to the sample and strongly positively correlated with CES-D in the cohort (r ≈ 0.81), indicating anxiety-prone temperament that commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptom scores. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 27; z = -1.57) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in the study (r ≈ -0.71), which provides additional evidence that this participant’s affective self-evaluation aligns with higher depressive symptom burden. Current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0; z = -1.61), and perceived stress is above average (PSS = 24; z = 0.65); these affective indicators further amplify the pattern of elevated internal distress and are consistent with higher CES-D scores.

Sleep-related data present a mixed picture. Objectively derived sleep duration is in the slightly-above-average range for the cohort (median 7 h 47 m; z = 0.74) with no daytime napping, and circadian heart rate metrics show a reasonably regular diurnal pattern (interdaily stability and intradaily variability near sample mean; mesor and amplitude only modestly elevated). However, subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9; z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep). The discrepancy between adequate objective sleep duration/regularity and poor subjective sleep quality suggests the participant perceives sleep problems despite generally preserved sleep timing and nocturnal heart-rate dipping. In this sample PSQI and subjective sleep disturbance tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptoms, so the participant’s reported sleep disturbance supports elevated symptom burden even though wearable-derived circadian regularity does not show major disruption.

Behavioral and social indicators show both risk and protective signals. The participant reports regular solo exercise (≥3×/week; z = 1.07), which is a modest protective behavior relative to depressive symptoms, and alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine 1–2×/week). However, time spent socializing is low (16–30 minutes; z = -1.41) and many recreational/social activities are minimal, which reduces a potential social buffer and aligns with features commonly associated with higher depressive scores. High interpersonal trust (z = 1.79) and average health satisfaction provide some countervailing, potentially protective factors, but their correlations with CES-D in the cohort are moderate and do not outweigh the strong signal from anxiety and low self-esteem.

Integrating modalities: the strongest and most diagnostically relevant signals are high trait anxiety and low self-esteem—both highly correlated with CES-D in this population—accompanied by low self-reported happiness and subjective sleep disturbance. Wearable-derived physiology (resting HR and circadian metrics) and objective sleep duration do not show major pathological deviation and therefore temper the case for very severe or biologically dysregulated depression, but they do not negate the robust self-report indicators of elevated affective symptom burden. On balance—given the magnitude of anxiety and self-esteem deviations and their known strong correlations with CES-D in the cohort—the evidence supports that this participant’s CES-D score is more likely to be in the higher half of the study distribution.

Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) and current self-reported happiness is below average (Z = -0.53), both features that align with increased depressive symptoms but are of moderate magnitude. Self-esteem appears relatively high (RSES Z = 0.4), a strong inverse correlate of depressive symptoms in this dataset (r ≈ -0.71), which is likely to exert a protective effect against higher CES-D scores.

Sleep-related self-report and wearable-derived sleep metrics point to notable sleep disturbance that can be relevant for mood. The PSQI indicates disturbed subjective sleep (score = 8). Fitbit-derived metrics show unusually long median nightly sleep (9 h 34 min; Z ≈ 2.96) and very high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 249 minutes; Z ≈ 3.37). Long sleep duration together with large variability and poor subjective sleep quality can be associated with elevated depressive symptoms in university samples; here the sleep variability has a small positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.21), suggesting some risk contribution despite the median sleep duration itself not correlating with CES-D in these data.

Wearable circadian and cardiovascular signals are largely consistent with regular daily structure and relatively low physiological arousal. Interdaily stability is near average (Z ≈ -0.16) and intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -1.73), indicating limited fragmentation of activity rhythms—an indicator generally associated with better mood regulation. Mesor and resting heart rate are on the lower side of the population (mesor Z ≈ -1.28; RHR Z ≈ -0.04), and amplitude is modestly blunted (Z ≈ -0.81). Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and daytime peaks with a mid-afternoon acrophase; none of these aggregated hourly deviations shows substantial correlations with depressive symptoms in this dataset.

Behavioral and social factors on balance suggest protective engagement. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise and sports participation (both Z > +1), and substantial socializing time (3–4 hours, Z ≈ +1.74). Recreational screen use and music listening are elevated but not strongly associated with CES-D here. Substance use is moderate but not elevated for drugs; overall activity patterns (regular exercise and social interaction) are factors typically linked to lower depressive symptom burden.

Integrating modalities: risk indicators include disturbed subjective sleep, extreme and variable sleep durations, elevated perceived stress, and lower momentary happiness. Protective indicators of similar or greater weight include relatively high self-esteem, frequent exercise and sports participation, substantial social contact, and stable day–night activity rhythms measured by low intradaily variability. Given the moderate-to-weak magnitude of risk signals (sleep disturbance and stress) and the presence of several robust protective features (notably self-esteem, regular exercise, social engagement, and coherent circadian structure), the overall balance of evidence favors a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

Trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) is modestly elevated relative to the study sample and is one of the strongest correlates of CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.82), which indicates a vulnerability factor for higher depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is lower than the sample mean (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73) and, given its strong negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), also points in the direction of greater symptom risk. Current self-rated happiness is below average (Z = -0.53) and is moderately inversely related to CES-D. Perceived stress, however, is slightly below the study mean (PSS Z = -0.44), which does not support a high concurrent stress burden.

Behavioral and social indices are largely favorable and constitute potential protective factors. The participant reports frequent exercise both alone and with others (≥3 times/week; Z-scores > 1.0), above-average social time with friends (3–4 hours, Z = 1.74), low recreational drug use, and only moderate alcohol use. Health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 1.3) and academic performance is strong (GPA ~3.7–3.8). These behavioral features have small negative correlations with CES-D in the sample and collectively suggest relatively good psychosocial functioning and engagement, which typically mitigate depressive symptom severity.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology present a mixed but predominantly non-pathological picture. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5.0, Z = -0.8) is in the “good sleep” range. Wearable-recorded median nocturnal sleep duration is long (median 9 h 2 min, Z = 2.3)—longer than the sample average—and sleep timing is moderately regular (median sleep start ~23:14, modest start-time variability). Mean number of naps is negligible. From a clinical-epidemiologic perspective, prolonged sleep duration can sometimes accompany depressive presentations (hypersomnia), but in this case the sample-level correlation between sleep duration and CES-D is essentially null; therefore the long sleep by itself is not a strong indicator of higher CES-D in this cohort.

Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a pronounced and regular diurnal rhythm rather than a blunted or disorganized one. The participant has a relatively high mesor and amplitude (mesor Z = 0.77; amplitude Z = 1.0), a strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.06), and only modest interdaily instability or intradaily fragmentation (interdaily stability and intradaily variability Zs near 0–0.5). Resting heart rate is low–normal (≈58.7 bpm). Hourly aggregated deviations show a large morning rise (8–9 AM) and afternoon peaks, and deep nocturnal troughs; these time-of-day patterns are consistent with robust circadian entrainment. Across the available circadian and hourly heart-rate features the correlations with CES-D are small, suggesting limited predictive value in this sample for depressive symptom burden.

Integrative appraisal: risk-related self-report traits (modestly elevated trait anxiety, below-average self-esteem, and somewhat lower reported happiness) point toward increased CES-D scores relative to peers, and these scales are among the strongest correlates of CES-D in the dataset. However, the participant shows multiple protective behavioral and physiological indicators—regular and frequent exercise (including social exercise), substantial social engagement, good subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, strong academic functioning, low substance use, and a pronounced, regular circadian rhythm—all of which are associated with lower depressive symptomatology or functional resilience in this sample. On balance, the protective behavioral and physiological profile appears to outweigh the moderate trait-level risk indicators. Given the overall pattern (mixed but more protective signs than risk signs, and generally weak wearable–CESD correlations), the participant is more consistent with the lower half of the CES-D distribution in this study population.

96689,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Self-report profile — affect and trait symptoms:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47; z ≈ 0.6, classified “anxious”), but concurrently reports high global self-esteem (RSES = 39/40; z ≈ 0.1) and modest current happiness (self-rated “3.0”; z ≈ −0.5). Perceived stress is not elevated relative to the sample (PSS = 20; z ≈ −0.4). Health satisfaction is relatively low (2.11 on 1–7; z ≈ −1.6). Taken together, the self-report pattern is mixed: there is a clear signal of chronic anxiety proneness, but other self-evaluative measures (high self-esteem, moderate stress, substantial reported social time) do not align with a broadly elevated profile of depressive symptomatology.

Sleep — objective vs. subjective:
Objective wearable sleep metrics indicate generally adequate and consistent nocturnal sleep: median duration ≈ 7 h 18 min (z ≈ 0.14) with low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 38 min; z ≈ −1.4) and a stable sleep onset time (median ≈ 01:55 AM with low SD; z ≈ −1.2). However, the participant’s PSQI score is 6, which exceeds common cutpoints for clinically meaningful sleep disturbance and suggests subjective sleep complaints despite objectively sufficient and regular sleep opportunity. This divergence (subjective disturbance vs. objectively sufficient, regular sleep) may reflect either sleep quality concerns not captured by duration or effortful late sleep timing relative to circadian preferences.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a well-structured rhythm: elevated amplitude (z ≈ 1.36), above-average interdaily stability and intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.7–1.0), and a clear acrophase in the late afternoon (~5:14 PM). The mesor and resting heart rate are within typical-to-lower ranges for the sample (mesor z ≈ 0.5; resting HR ≈ 58.8 bpm, z ≈ 0.1). Hourly aggregated deviations demonstrate the expected deep nocturnal heart rate troughs and daytime elevations, with particularly large relative elevations in the early evening hours. The combination of high amplitude and good day-to-day stability generally aligns with intact circadian organization; intradaily variability is somewhat elevated, which can reflect more pronounced within-day transitions but, in context with the strong 24-hr structure, does not indicate gross circadian disruption.

Behavioral patterns and lifestyle:
The participant reports minimal substance use and virtually no structured exercise or sports (exercise “not at all”; z-scores strongly negative), yet reports relatively high time socializing with friends (2–3 hours/day; z ≈ 0.95). Daily recreational activities otherwise show low engagement in sedentary hobbies. BMI is in the normal–overweight boundary (≈ 24.9). The behavioral profile suggests limited physical activity (a risk factor for mood symptoms) but substantial social interaction and low substance exposure (both potential protective factors).

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
Indicators that would support elevated depressive symptoms are limited: trait anxiety is notable, subjective sleep complaints exist (PSQI > 5), and self-rated happiness is somewhat below sample median. However, several objective and self-report features point away from high depressive burden: high self-esteem, regular and adequate sleep duration, strong circadian amplitude and stability, low substance use, and relatively high social engagement. The physiological metrics do not show the flattened circadian or elevated nocturnal heart rate that often accompany higher depressive symptomatology in this kind of sample. On balance, the evidence favors a relatively low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden compared with the study population rather than a high burden.

Self-esteem is higher than the sample mean (RSES Z = 0.4) and this measure has a strong negative correlation with CES-D in the sample, suggesting that higher self-regard is a protective factor for depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is modest (PSS score 20; Z = -0.44) and overall health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z = 0.22). The PSQI score (6) is just above the common cutoff for disturbed sleep, indicating some subjective sleep complaints despite other indicators of relative well-being.

Behavioral and lifestyle data show a mix of potentially risk-related and protective features. The participant reports moderate alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1) but no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise is infrequent (exercising alone 1–2×/week; sports “not at all”), and social exercise is rare. Leisure patterns include high sedentary hobby engagement (more than 4 hours; Z = 3.19) and modest internet use (2–3 hours; Z = 0.85). Socializing time is near the sample mean. The combination of low organized physical activity and high sedentary hobby time could be behaviorally relevant to mood regulation, but correlations between these specific activities and CES-D in the sample are small.

Objective sleep and circadian measures from the wearable show generally adequate sleep duration but late and somewhat variable timing. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = -0.13), and night-to-night duration variability is low-to-moderate (SD 63 minutes; Z = -0.85). Median sleep start is late (around 01:42), with moderate variability. Daytime naps are relatively more frequent than the sample mean (mean daily naps 0.26; Z = 2.23), and napping has a small positive sample correlation with CES-D. Subjectively reported disturbed sleep (PSQI) combined with late sleep timing and increased napping could reflect circadian misalignment or compensatory sleep that is relevant to mood, although the objective duration is within a typical range.

Cardiovascular circadian metrics indicate a lower-amplitude, lower-mesor heart rate rhythm with elevated fragmentation. Resting heart rate is low (51.2 bpm; Z = -0.83) and the mesor (mean modeled HR) is below the population mean (63.24; Z = -1.46). Amplitude is reduced (7.12; Z = -1.18), while intradaily variability (0.65; Z = 0.74) is elevated and interdaily stability is somewhat lower (0.35; Z = -0.49), consistent with a rhythm that is less robust and more fragmented across days. Hourly aggregate deviations show a pronounced morning increase in heart rate (notably a large positive deviation around 10–11 AM; Z ≈ 2.7) and deeply negative values overnight and in early morning hours, consistent with nocturnal quiescence and a distinct daytime activation period. Overall, these features (reduced mesor/amplitude and greater fragmentation) can be associated with behavioral irregularity and have modest correlations with depressive symptoms in the sample, but the effect sizes in this participant’s data are small.

Synthesis and CES-D placement: weighing the multimodal evidence, the balance favors relatively low-to-average depressive symptom burden. Several robust indicators that correlate strongly with CES-D in the sample point toward lower symptomatology in this participant: low trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, above-average reported happiness, modest perceived stress, and adequate objective sleep duration. Countervailing signals include a slightly elevated PSQI score (subjective disturbed sleep), late sleep timing with increased napping, high sedentary hobby time, and wearable indices of circadian fragmentation and reduced heart rate amplitude. However, these latter factors show only small sample correlations with CES-D or are of modest magnitude in this participant. On balance, the preponderance of psychological self-report markers and the absence of strong objective indicators of elevated depressive symptom burden support classification in the lower half of the study CES-D distribution.

36117,16.0,0.7020725388601037,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) together with high self-regard (Rosenberg-related score Z = 0.96) and elevated current happiness (score 5.0, Z = 1.64). These features are strongly informative for depressive symptom burden in this sample: trait anxiety correlates positively with CES-D (r = 0.81) while self-esteem and happiness correlate negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71 and r = -0.46, respectively). Perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 21, Z ≈ -0.17) and interpersonal trust is relatively high (Z = 1.79, r with CES-D = -0.41). Taken together, the self-report pattern indicates multiple protective psychosocial signals (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high reported happiness and trust) that are associated with lower CES-D scores in this population.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Objective wearable data show a median nightly sleep duration of about 7 hours 39 minutes (Z = 0.58) with no reported daily naps (Z = -0.86). However, subjective sleep quality is worse (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), and sleep timing is late and somewhat variable (median sleep start ≈ 01:13, start-time SD ≈ 100 minutes). The combination is a partial discrepancy: adequate total sleep duration by Fitbit but subjectively disturbed and irregular timing. Circadian heart-rate measures are relatively robust: high interdaily stability (0.55, Z = 1.16), low intradaily variability (0.27, Z = -1.94), elevated amplitude (Z = 1.58) and a pronounced diurnal pattern with acrophase in the late afternoon (≈17:06). These features indicate a consistent, consolidated 24-hour rhythm in physiological arousal despite late bedtimes. Sleep timing variability and sleep variability have modest positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.20–0.22), suggesting the participant’s subjective sleep complaints and timing irregularity could relate to higher depressive symptoms, but objective rhythm regularity argues against severe circadian disruption.

Cardiovascular and activity markers: The participant’s resting heart rate and fitted mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 72 bpm, Mesor = 88.9; Z-scores 1.65 and 2.04 respectively). These elevated mean cardiac levels show small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), implying a weak association between higher baseline physiological arousal and depressive symptoms in the cohort. Hourly aggregate deviations display the expected overnight decreases and daytime/evening increases; there is no evidence of blunted diurnal variation. The overall wearable-derived profile—good 24-hour autocorrelation, strong amplitude, low fragmentation—reflects organized behavioral and physiological rhythms, which in prior studies often associate with lower depressive symptom load.

Behavioral context and lifestyle: The participant reports high social engagement (socializing >4 hours daily, Z = 2.53) and frequent group exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.23), both behaviors generally linked to better mood and lower CES-D (exercise with others shows a negative correlation with CES-D, r ≈ -0.23). However, there are also higher sedentary/leisure behaviors (sedentary hobby >4 hours, Z = 3.19; internet use >4 hours, Z = 2.19) that correlate modestly with higher CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.12–0.25). Substance use is minimal. Overall, social activity and organized group exercise are likely protective; high sedentary leisure and heavy internet use are potential risk factors but are counterbalanced by social and physical activity.

Integrated interpretation and likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms: Multiple strong, CES-D–relevant indicators point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden for this participant. Specifically, low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated current happiness, frequent social engagement, and robust circadian regularity are all associated with lower CES-D scores and are prominent in this participant’s profile. Countervailing signals are subjective sleep disturbance and late/variable sleep timing, modestly elevated resting heart rate/mesor, and high sedentary/internet time; these have smaller associations with CES-D in this sample. Considering the magnitude of the protective indicators (particularly the very high self-esteem and happiness Z-scores and low trait anxiety) versus the more modest risk signals, the balance of evidence supports that this participant’s CES-D score is likely within the lower half of the study distribution.

92515,4.0,0.15284974093264247,"Summary of self-report psychological profile and symptom-related measures:
The participant’s self-report profile is characterized by relatively low chronic anxiety (STAI trait = 36, z = -0.52) and elevated positive factors that are strongly inversely related to depressive symptoms in the sample (high self-esteem: RSES z = 0.4; current happiness z = 1.64; interpersonal trust z = 0.83). Of these, self-esteem has a large negative correlation with CES‑D in the study (r = -0.71), making it a particularly informative protective indicator. Perceived stress is low-to-moderate (PSS = 19, z = -0.71), and although the PSQI indicates some subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), many of the symptom‑related self-report measures (low anxiety, high happiness, high self‑esteem, moderate stress) point away from a high burden of depressive symptoms.

Sleep timing and subjective/behavioral sleep characteristics:
Wearable and self-reported sleep metrics show a clear late sleep schedule and shortened habitual sleep duration. Median sleep onset is late (2:57 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is short (5 h 55 min, z = -1.58), with moderate night-to-night variability in sleep start time (SD ≈ 110 min, z = 0.59). The PSQI classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep, but the study‑level correlation between objective sleep duration and CES‑D is essentially null (r ≈ -0.01), and sleep variability shows only a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.22). In short, the participant exhibits late timing and restricted sleep—features that are behavioral risk-factors for mood dysregulation—but in this sample those specific sleep metrics carry limited weight with respect to CES‑D variance.

Circadian and cardiovascular rhythm features:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a generally regular daily structure. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability are close to the cohort mean (z ≈ 0.09 and -0.11, respectively) and autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively elevated (z = 0.73), consistent with consistent day-to-day heart rate patterns. Mesor and amplitude are slightly below average (mesor z = -0.23; amplitude z = -0.36), suggesting modestly lower overall heart rate and somewhat blunted amplitude, but correlations of these measures with CES‑D are small. The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal troughs and midday peaks with an acrophase near mid-to-late afternoon (4:43 PM); these diurnal patterns are physiologically coherent and do not exhibit strong associations with CES‑D in this dataset.

Behavioral activity, social and substance-use context:
The participant reports regular social and group-based physical activity (exercising with others and sports ~1–2x/week; exercise-with-others z = 0.53, sports z = 0.91), and limited solitary exercise. Social engagement and group exercise variables have small negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample (protective direction). Alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2x/week) is modest and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Daily recreational patterns show some screen time (watching video content ~31 minutes/hour) but overall sedentary hobby engagement is low. Taken together, behavioral engagement and social interaction metrics are more consistent with mid-to-lower depressive symptom burden than with elevated burden.

Integration and weight of evidence regarding depressive symptom burden:
When weighting indicators by their association with CES‑D in this study, the strongest signals favoring lower depressive symptoms are high self‑esteem (large negative correlation with CES‑D), elevated self-reported happiness, low trait anxiety, and behavioral markers of social and group exercise participation. Physiological circadian regularity and a relatively low resting heart rate further support an organized behavioral-physiological profile. Countervailing signals include objectively short nightly sleep and late sleep timing and a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep; however, these sleep metrics show little-to-moderate relationships with CES‑D in the cohort and therefore carry less inferential weight than the strong negative predictors (especially self‑esteem). Overall, the balance of multimodal evidence indicates that this participant is more likely to have CES‑D scores in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

49790,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report profile and symptom-relevant traits:
The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI trait score well below the sample mean, Z = -1.41) and relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = +1.1). Both measures have strong expected associations with depressive symptoms in this sample (STAI positively correlated r ≈ 0.81 with CES‑D; self‑esteem negatively correlated r ≈ -0.71), and the directions observed here favor lower depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is modestly elevated relative to the sample (PSS Z ≈ +0.38; correlation with CES‑D r ≈ 0.28), and current self‑reported happiness is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.53; r with CES‑D ≈ -0.46), indicating some transient negative affect or stress but not a profile of marked trait affective disturbance. Other self‑report indicators that typically buffer against depressive symptoms—higher health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.22) and higher interpersonal trust (Z ≈ +1.47)—also suggest psychosocial resources that would be expected to relate to lower CES‑D scores.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle:
Substance use is minimal-to-moderate (no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use; alcohol use mostly wine/liquor ~1–2×/week), and academic performance is good (GPAs in the mid‑3.5 range). Physical activity is present but limited (exercise alone and with others about 1–2×/week; no organized sports). Socializing time is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.62). Overall, lifestyle indicators present a mix of modest social and activity engagement without heavy substance use—patterns that are not strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology in this cohort.

Sleep and circadian behavior:
Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (≈8 h 4 min; Z ≈ +1.1), and naps are essentially absent. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7) crosses the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep, suggesting perceived sleep problems. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:18) with high night‑to‑night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 169 minutes; Z ≈ +1.89). Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate show low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.32) and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ -1.54), indicating an irregular daily structure. Late and variable sleep timing and reduced rhythm stability are features that have been associated with higher depressive symptoms in prior research; in this dataset the sleep‑timing variability and circadian irregularity show modest positive correlations with CES‑D (r ~ 0.2–0.23), so they represent moderate risk factors for increased depressive symptoms for this participant.

Wearable physiological signals:
The participant’s resting heart rate and MESOR (mean circadian heart rate level) are both elevated relative to the study sample (resting HR Z ≈ +2.09; MESOR Z ≈ +2.03). Elevated tonic heart rate shows a modest positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.20), suggesting a small link between autonomic arousal and depressive symptoms here. The circadian amplitude is somewhat reduced (Z ≈ -0.97), while hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and daytime peak but with an overall elevated baseline. Intradaily variability is near the mean (Z ≈ +0.17) and its correlation with CES‑D is negligible. In sum, physiological measures indicate higher-than-average cardiac tone/activation but only weak associations with CES‑D in this cohort.

Integrated interpretation and weighting of evidence:
Findings are mixed but tilt toward lower overall depressive symptom burden. The strongest predictors in the available data—trait anxiety (very low) and self‑esteem (above average)—both point toward lower CES‑D scores and have large sample correlations with CES‑D. Objective and subjective sleep features (late and irregular sleep timing, subjective disturbed sleep) and elevated resting heart rate provide countervailing evidence that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms, but their correlations with CES‑D in this dataset are smaller in magnitude. Perceived stress is modestly elevated and happiness slightly reduced, representing mild risk signals; however, positive indicators such as high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, good academic performance, high health satisfaction, and low substance use are comparatively prominent and have stronger links to lower CES‑D in the study data.

Conclusion — CES‑D distribution placement:
Weighing the relative magnitudes and directions of the measures and their correlations with CES‑D, the preponderance of evidence indicates a lower or average depressive symptom burden relative to the study population (bottom half of the CES‑D distribution).

78657,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant reports generally favorable psychological traits that are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI is slightly below the study mean (score 38, Z = -0.33) despite the strong positive population-level correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D (r = 0.81); Rosenberg self-esteem is high (score 39, Z = 0.11) and has a strong inverse correlation with depressive symptoms in the sample (r = -0.71). Perceived stress is low relative to the cohort (PSS = 17, Z = -1.26), and substance use is minimal for recreational/non-prescribed drugs; alcohol use is moderate and typical for the sample. Self-rated current happiness is slightly below the mean (3.0, Z = -0.53), and satisfaction with physical health is lower than average (Z = -1.53), which are potential modest negative signals, but the overall self-report pattern favors lower overall depressive symptomatology (more protective than risk-inducing features).

Behavioral and social activity: The participant shows several behavioral markers that typically protect against elevated depressive symptoms. Exercise is frequent (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; Z-scores > 1), and reported socializing time is above average (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95). Recreational patterns include above-average time listening to music and video-game use, but no regular non-prescribed drug use and only moderate alcohol consumption. These activity and social engagement indicators suggest sustained behavioral activation and social contact, both of which are generally associated with lower CES-D scores in young adult samples.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Objective wearable and subjective sleep data identify clear sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity. Median nightly sleep duration is reduced (6 h 30 min, Z = -0.85) and the PSQI indicates disturbed subjective sleep (score = 7). Sleep timing is markedly delayed (median sleep start ~03:38 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = 0.88), and no daytime napping. Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.31, Z = -0.82) and elevated intradaily variability (0.67, Z = 0.88), consistent with an irregular and fragmented 24-hour pattern. The cosinor-derived mesor (≈68.8 bpm) and amplitude are near cohort averages, with an acrophase in the early evening (about 6:50 PM). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor reveal relatively elevated cardiovascular activation across late evening to early nighttime hours (largest positive deviations in the 7–11 PM and around midnight–1 AM windows; several of those hourly values have high positive Z-scores), and pronounced negative deviations during early morning and morning hours—patterns consistent with a delayed, nocturnally biased activity/arousal profile.

Integration with depressive-symptom correlates and overall interpretation: Several strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, low perceived stress, frequent exercise, above-average social engagement, minimal drug use) weigh toward a lower CES-D score compared with the sample. Opposing signals are present in the sleep/circadian domain: disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), short median sleep duration, delayed sleep timing and high night-to-night variability, and objective circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability). Those sleep and rhythm features are modestly associated with depressive symptoms in population research and with modest positive correlations to CES-D in this dataset (e.g., sleep variability correlation ≈ 0.22), but the magnitude of those associations here is smaller than the protective self-report and behavioral indicators. Physiological signals (resting heart rate, mesor, and hourly deviation correlations) show only weak associations with CES-D in this sample. Weighing the totality of evidence, protective psychosocial and behavioral factors appear to predominate over the sleep-related risk markers, suggesting the participant’s overall CES-D score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

48154,3.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a profile characterized by relatively low affective risk factors and several protective features. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 30, z = -1.12) and comparatively high self-esteem (RSES z = 1.66) and momentary happiness (current happy z = 1.64). Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS score 21, z ≈ -0.17) and health satisfaction is modestly above average (z = 0.47). Substance use and recreational habits are low-to-moderate for this cohort (infrequent beer, weekly wine/liquor, rare recreational drugs) and exercise frequency is relatively high when done alone (exercise-alone z = 1.07). These self-report features that are strongly correlated with CES-D in the sample (notably STAI with r ≈ 0.81 and SelfEsteem with r ≈ -0.71) point toward lower depressive symptom burden in this individual.

Behavioral and social activity data provide additional context consistent with low-to-average depressive symptoms. The participant reports 1–2 hours of socializing with friends (z ≈ 0.16) and modest daily recreational screen time (internet use 2–3 hours, z = 0.85) but does not engage in several sedentary hobbies. Regular solitary exercise and some team/sport activity (sports z ≈ 0.91) suggest preserved behavioral activation and routine engagement in rewarding activities; these behaviors in the cohort show small negative correlations with CES-D. There is no indication of frequent non-prescribed drug use, and overall lifestyle markers (BMI 23.2, health satisfaction) are within typical ranges for the sample.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology show a mixed but largely non-alarming pattern. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration is relatively long compared with the cohort (median 8 h 3 min, z = 1.08) and sleep duration variability is lower than average (SD z = -0.85), indicating consistent and ample night sleep. Subjective sleep quality is rated in the “good” range on the PSQI (score = 5, z = -0.8). The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:03 AM), which indicates a delayed-evening chronotype, but this late timing is paired with sufficient duration and low nap frequency. Circadian regularity measures from heart rate show lower interdaily stability (z = -1.23), suggesting less day-to-day regularity in the rhythm of physiological activity, while intradaily variability is near the sample mean (z ≈ 0.1). In this dataset these circadian metrics have small or inconsistent correlations with CES-D (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.01; intradaily variability r ≈ -0.05), such that the primary implication is a somewhat irregular daily schedule rather than a clear signal of elevated depressive symptoms.

Cardiovascular markers are consistent with a physically fit or low-arousal profile. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, z = -0.26) and MESOR of aggregated heart rate is below the study mean (z = -0.78). Hourly aggregated deviations from the MESOR show pronounced nocturnal troughs (notably large negative deviations in the early morning hours) and a typical evening peak (acrophase ≈ 5:29 PM, and large positive deviations around 5–6 PM, z ≈ 1.13). These features are consistent with intact diurnal modulation of autonomic tone and do not map strongly onto higher CES-D in this sample (hourly correlations with CES-D are small and mixed).

Integrative interpretation and CES‑D likelihood: across multiple domains the participant shows several markers associated with lower depressive symptom burden—low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, regular and ample sleep, frequent exercise, and normative cardiovascular resting indices. The primary potential concerns are a delayed sleep timing and reduced interdaily stability of circadian heart rate rhythms, but these physiological markers have weak correlations with CES-D in the cohort and are offset by strong protective self-report indicators. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors classification in the lower half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

21793,15.0,0.6658031088082902,"Self-report indicators show a mixed but concerning profile with respect to depressive symptomatology. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z = 0.17; classified as ""anxious""), and perceived stress is substantially above the sample mean (PSS = 27; Z = 1.47). Current self-reported happiness is below average (score = 3; Z = -0.53). Sleep quality is subjectively poor (PSQI = 9; Z = 1.05, classified as ""Disturbed Sleep""), which commonly co-occurs with elevated depressive symptoms. In contrast, global self-esteem is relatively preserved (Rosenberg = 37; Z = -0.17) and substance use is minimal, which are features that would tend to mitigate risk. The reported pattern of increased stress and anxiety, reduced subjective happiness, and disturbed sleep collectively align with components of higher CES-D symptom burden, especially given the strong sample-level correlations reported between anxiety/stress measures and CES-D.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics provide behavioral and physiological evidence consistent with disrupted sleep/circadian organization. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 hr 9 min; Z = -1.29) and their median sleep start time is very late (03:36:45) with large night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD Z = 1.04). Mean daily naps are elevated (0.33 naps/day; Z = 3.05), indicating frequent daytime sleep episodes. Circadian summary metrics derived from heart rate show low interdaily stability (0.17; Z = -1.98) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = -1.45), together indicating weak day-to-day regularity of physiological rhythms. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.68; Z = 0.95), and cosinor-derived amplitude and mesor are lower than average (amplitude Z = -1.38; mesor Z = -1.13), suggesting a flattened and less robust heart-rate rhythm. These patterns—late, short, irregular sleep combined with reduced circadian stability and increased napping—are behavioral/physiological markers that have been associated in the literature with higher depressive symptom scores and, in the present dataset, have small-to-moderate correlations with CES-D.

Hourly heart-rate deviations and resting cardiac measures are broadly consistent with a blunted and shifted daily pattern rather than a profile of generalized autonomic hyperarousal. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm; Z = -0.47), and aggregate hourly deviations show pronounced reductions relative to the mesor in early morning hours and relative elevations in afternoon–evening hours (notably 3–4 pm and 7–8 pm). The cosinor acrophase at ~6:32 PM and reduced amplitude align with the late sleep timing and attenuated circadian rhythmicity described above. While some individual hourly deviations have weak correlations with CES-D, the overall pattern of reduced amplitude and instability is more informative at the group level for associations with depressive symptoms than any single hourly deviation.

Behavioral and contextual features provide additional, mixed information. The participant reports limited regular physical activity (exercise alone 1–2×/week; exercising with others infrequent), moderate levels of social time (1–2 hours; Z ≈ 0.16), high engagement with music (listening 3–4 hours; Z = 1.6), and low recreational drug use. Academic performance shows variability with a notable drop in one semester (2016 Fall GPA = 2.17), which could reflect situational stressors or functional impact; however, health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z = 0.3). Taken together, lifestyle data do not strongly contradict the signal from stress, anxiety, disturbed sleep, and circadian irregularity—factors that more strongly point toward elevated depressive symptom burden.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: there are several convergent indicators associated with higher CES-D scores in this sample (elevated trait anxiety with a strong sample-level correlation to CES-D, high perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, short and irregular sleep timing with elevated napping, and markedly low interdaily stability of physiological rhythms). Protective signals (relatively high self-esteem, low substance use, some social activity) are present but appear weaker in magnitude than the risk-related signals. On balance, the pattern of self-report and wearable-derived features is more consistent with placement in the higher half of CES-D scores for this study population.

37218,24.0,0.8238341968911918,"Summary of self-report measures and affective indicators:
The participant’s pattern of questionnaire responses shows several strong signals that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) is above the study mean and has a large positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), indicating that persistent anxiety proneness is a salient correlate of higher depressive symptoms for this sample and for this individual. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which also tends to track with greater depressive symptom burden. Current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2, Z = -1.61), another affective indicator associated with higher CES-D scores (r = -0.46). These affective and trait measures together form a coherent picture of elevated internal distress and lower positive affect/self-worth relative to the study population.

Sleep, circadian, and wearable physiology:
Subjective and wearable-derived sleep metrics converge on disrupted sleep and a delayed, compressed sleep schedule. PSQI is elevated (score = 10, Z = 1.52), classified as “disturbed sleep,” and median nightly sleep from the Fitbit is short (6 h 1 m, Z = -1.45) with a very late median sleep start time (03:56). Sleep timing variability is moderate (SD ~74 minutes). Circadian summary metrics show modest interdaily stability (IS = 0.48, Z = 0.58) but a relatively low cosinor amplitude (8.83, Z = -0.63), which can reflect blunted daily physiological variation; MESOR and resting heart rate are near or slightly above the population mean (MESOR Z = 0.30; RHR = 61, Z = 0.34). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show elevated relative arousal in late evening/early night hours (e.g., positive deviations around midnight–1am) and stronger negative deviations during early morning hours, consistent with late sleep onset and nocturnal arousal. Poor subjective sleep, short duration, late/tardive timing, and blunted amplitude together are patterns that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptom levels in student samples.

Behavioral habits and social/contextual factors:
The participant reports low engagement with alcohol or drug use and high levels of time socializing with friends (3–4 hours daily, Z = 1.74), both of which are typically protective or neutral with respect to depression in cross-sectional samples. Exercise frequency is very low (reports “not at all” for both alone and with others; Zs ≪ 0), which removes an expected behavioral buffer against mood symptoms. Recreational habits include high music listening (>4 hours, Z = 2.06), which may reflect a coping strategy; the study-level correlation between music listening and CES-D is positive (r ≈ 0.25), suggesting this pattern is sometimes linked with higher depressive symptoms in the sample. Academic performance (reported GPA 3.76) is high and may reflect preserved functional domains.

Integration and relative weighting of evidence for depressive symptom burden:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, affective trait measures (high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low self-reported happiness) and sleep disruption are the strongest and most directly relevant correlates of CES-D in this dataset (notably, STAI and self-esteem show large correlations with CES-D). Wearable physiology supports the subjective reports of disturbed and delayed sleep and shows a lower circadian amplitude, which is concordant with elevated risk for depressive symptoms. In contrast, several factors would argue against a strongly elevated CES-D: the participant reports low perceived stress relative to peers (PSS Z = -2.07), substantial time socializing, abstinence from substances, and strong academic performance. These protective signals are meaningful but appear to be outweighed by the clustering of strong risk-related indicators (affective measures and sleep/circadian disruption), particularly given the high correlations those measures have with CES-D in the study population.

Overall assessment relative to the study distribution:
On balance, the preponderance of evidence—especially elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low reported happiness, disturbed and late sleep with short duration, and blunted circadian amplitude—aligns with patterns that are associated with higher CES-D scores in this sample. While there are noteworthy protective features (low substance use, high social time, low perceived stress, high GPA), the magnitude and directness of the affective and sleep-related risk indicators make it more likely that this participant’s CES-D score would fall in the upper half of the study distribution rather than the lower half.

Perceived stress is lower than average (PSS Z ≈ -0.98) and general health satisfaction is relatively high (Z ≈ 0.97), which further align with lower depressive symptom burden.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian rhythm metrics indicate robust daily structure and cardiovascular fitness. Interdaily stability (Z ≈ 1.08) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ 1.65) are above the cohort mean, while intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -1.24), consistent with a regular, consolidated circadian pattern. Resting heart rate and mesor are both lower than average (RHR ≈ 48.7 bpm, RHR Z ≈ -1.13; mesor Z ≈ -1.01), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness; daytime heart rate shows a pronounced midday increase (peak around 11:00–12:00 with z-scores up to ~1.99) and expected nocturnal decreases (-18 to -25 bpm below mesor across early-morning hours), consistent with intact nocturnal physiological downregulation. Wearable sleep measures show a relatively long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 35 min, Z ≈ 1.74) and few naps, but objective long duration co-occurs with subjective poor sleep quality (high PSQI), indicating possible nonrestorative sleep or sleep fragmentation not fully captured by duration alone.

Synthesizing across modalities, the preponderance of evidence favors a relatively low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden. Strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, low perceived stress, high health satisfaction, frequent exercise, regular circadian rhythms, and low resting heart rate) weigh heavily toward lower CES-D scores. The most salient risk signal is markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ 2.9), which is an important correlate of depressive symptoms; however, other objective sleep and behavior metrics (regular sleep timing variability, long duration, consolidated circadian rhythmicity) and several strong inverse correlates of CES-D mitigate the isolated high PSQI score. Taken holistically, the balance of measures suggests this participant is more likely to lie in the lower half of the study distribution for CES-D scores.

81420,25.0,0.8393782383419689,"Self-report psychological profile and symptom-relevant traits:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86), a measure that in this sample is strongly positively correlated with CES-D scores (r ≈ 0.81). They also endorse lower than typical self‑esteem (RSES = 31; Z = -1.01), and self‑esteem in this dataset is strongly inversely correlated with depressive symptoms (r ≈ -0.71). Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38), and current self‑rated happiness is slightly above average (score = 4.0; Z = 0.55), though happiness correlates inversely with CES-D (r ≈ -0.46). Overall, the combination of relatively high trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem provides robust self‑report evidence that is predictive of higher CES‑D symptom burden, even though some positive well‑being items (reported happiness) attenuate that signal.

Sleep timing, subjective sleep quality, and circadian organization:
Objective sleep duration is near sample average (median = 7 h 12 min; Z ≈ 0.02) with modest night‑to‑night variability, but the participant’s median sleep onset is late (about 02:40 AM) and they report clinically relevant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; classified as disturbed sleep). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show reduced circadian amplitude (Amplitude Z ≈ -0.74) and reduced interdaily stability (IS Z ≈ -0.99), indicating a blunted and less regular heart‑rate rhythm across days. Resting heart rate is slightly above average (62.6 bpm; Z ≈ 0.53). Taken together, objective and subjective sleep/circadian indicators point to late and irregular timing with blunted physiological rhythmicity — a pattern that often co-occurs with elevated mood symptomatology even when total sleep time is adequate.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
The participant endorses relatively frequent exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ 1.07) and reports routine social activity (1–2 hours socializing), low recreational drug use, and limited daily media exposure. These behavioral factors (regular physical activity, moderate social engagement, low substance use) are conventionally protective or associated with lower depressive symptom scores in this sample (correlations generally weak but in the protective direction). Health satisfaction is low (score 2.78; Z ≈ -1.11), which aligns with other indicators that correlate with higher CES‑D scores.

Integration and implications for depressive symptom burden:
There is a mixed signal: protective lifestyle behaviors (regular exercise, some socialization, low substance use) and average objective sleep duration weigh against high depressive symptom burden, while strong risk indicators — notably elevated trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem — strongly favor higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep disturbance, late and irregular sleep timing, blunted circadian amplitude, and modestly elevated resting heart rate further align with patterns commonly associated with elevated CES‑D scores. Given the high predictive weight of the anxiety and self‑esteem measures in this dataset (large correlations with CES‑D), and the presence of additional supportive indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, low health satisfaction, blunted circadian rhythm), the balance of evidence indicates this participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study population’s CES‑D distribution.

67709,29.0,0.8989637305699482,"Self-report measures show a pattern of elevated internal distress on anxiety and stress indices alongside lowered self-regard. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 46, z = 0.46) and perceived stress (PSS = 26, z = 1.19) are both above the sample mean, and the STAI score has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.82). Rosenberg self-esteem is below average (score = 33, z = -0.73) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), indicating that lower self-esteem in this individual co-occurs with the kinds of affective symptoms that typically load on the CES-D. Subjective happiness is modestly above average (current = 4.0, z = 0.55) and health satisfaction is slightly above mean (4.56, z = 0.22), which are protective indicators, but these are smaller signals relative to the robust anxiety and low self-esteem measures.

Sleep-related self-report and wearable metrics point to a late and irregular sleep pattern with substantial night-to-night variability. The PSQI score of 6 (classified as disturbed sleep) signals subjective sleep difficulties. Objective Fitbit-derived sleep shows a long median nightly duration (8 h 16 m, z = 1.34) but a very large sleep-duration standard deviation (173 minutes, z = 1.65), and an unusually late median sleep-start time (about 03:45). The sleep-start variability is also elevated. These features—long but highly variable sleep and a very delayed sleep timing—are associated in the literature with affective dysregulation and align with small positive correlations in this dataset between sleep irregularity and CES-D (e.g., sleep variability r ≈ 0.19; sleep start time SD r ≈ 0.22).

Cardiovascular and circadian-derived features indicate a weakly regular circadian profile with a pronounced evening physiological peak. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show low-to-average interdaily stability (0.38, z = -0.24) and low intradaily variability (0.46, z = -0.6), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.19, z = -1.12), together suggesting reduced day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms. Parametric cosinor results indicate a lower mesor (67.9 bpm, z = -0.83) and modest amplitude; the acrophase is in the early evening (around 6:15 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations reveal a very large positive deviation from mesor at 5–6 PM (+29.45, z = 2.76), consistent with a pronounced evening arousal peak. These circadian irregularities and the late evening physiological activation are congruent with the late sleep timing and can reflect disrupted daily structure that is often found in people reporting greater depressive symptoms, though wearable–CES-D correlations in the dataset are generally small.

Behavioral context provides mixed signals: the participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use), frequent exercise with others (three times a week or more, z = 1.23), modest socializing (1–2 hours daily, near average), and moderate internet and music use (both above average, internet z = 1.52, music z = 1.13). Exercise with others and low substance use are protective and have negative correlations with CES-D in this sample (exercise with others r ≈ -0.24). Conversely, greater internet use and solitary evening activities can relate weakly to higher CES-D (internet r ≈ 0.25). Overall, behavioral habits present some resilience (social exercise, low substance use), but do not fully offset the combination of elevated anxiety/stress, low self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep, highly variable and delayed objective sleep, and circadian irregularity.

Weighing evidence for low/median versus elevated CES-D burden: evidence supporting a lower or median CES-D (bottom 50%) includes protective health behaviors (low substance use), regular social exercise, normal BMI, and modestly positive self-rated happiness and health satisfaction. However, the strongest and most directly CES-D–relevant signals favor elevated depressive symptomatology: very strong associations of trait anxiety and low self-esteem with CES-D in this dataset, PSQI-defined disturbed sleep, markedly delayed and inconsistent sleep timing, reduced 24-hour rhythm regularity, and evening physiological hyperactivation. These converging subjective (anxiety, stress, low self-esteem) and objective (sleep timing variability, circadian irregularity) indicators more strongly align with patterns seen in the higher half of CES-D scores in the study population.

36552,10.0,0.43005181347150256,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant presents a mixed symptom pattern across self-report instruments. Trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) is modestly elevated relative to the sample and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.81), indicating that the participant’s anxiety proneness is a potential signal for greater depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress is also above average (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) and shows a positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.28), consistent with stress-related risk. Conversely, global self-esteem is high (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and self-esteem has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), which is a substantial protective factor against depressive symptoms. Current self-rated happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53; r with CES-D = -0.46), providing additional, but moderate, evidence of lowered positive affect.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), minimal substance use, high academic functioning (GPAs in the mid-3.5–3.8 range), and above-average satisfaction with health (score = 5/7, Z = 0.55). Social exercise and certain social/leisure activities are less frequent (e.g., exercising with others and some social activities have negative Z-scores), which may reduce social buffering effects. Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 7, Z = 0.13), suggesting clinically meaningful sleep complaints despite other healthy lifestyle features; disturbed sleep is commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms in prior literature.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics: Objective sleep is shorter than the sample median (median duration ≈ 6 h 23 min, Z = -1.0) and bedtimes are late (median sleep start ≈ 01:28), although nightly variability in duration and start time is relatively low (SD ≈ 49 min, negative Z-scores), indicating consistent but curtailed late sleep. Mean daily naps are essentially absent. Circadian measures derived from heart rate show reduced amplitude (amplitude Z = -1.07), low interdaily stability (Z = -0.99), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), a pattern consistent with blunted and somewhat fragmented circadian organization. These wearable circadian features (low amplitude and stability, higher fragmentation) are physiologically plausibly linked with mood dysregulation, though the dataset’s direct correlations between these specific measures and CES-D are small to modest.

Cardiovascular and diurnal arousal patterns: Resting heart rate is moderately elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 64.3 bpm, Z = 0.73; r with CES-D = 0.19), and aggregated hourly deviations from the heart rate mesor show an unusually large positive deviation in the mid-to-late afternoon (3–4 PM: +19.9 bpm, Z = 1.99). Nighttime hours show appropriate downward deviations relative to the mesor. The afternoon peak may reflect a reliably higher physiological arousal period or scheduled activity during that time; an elevated resting heart rate and atypical daily arousal profile can be associated with stress-related physiology and correlate modestly with depressive symptoms in this sample.

Synthesis and weighting of evidence: The profile contains both risk and protective indicators. Strong protective markers include very high self-esteem, good academic performance, regular exercise, minimal substance use, and reasonably high health satisfaction. Risk indicators include elevated trait anxiety (with a large dataset-level association with CES-D), above-average perceived stress, subjectively disturbed sleep and objectively shortened, late sleep, blunted circadian amplitude with greater intraday fragmentation, and a modestly elevated resting heart rate. Several of the strongest dataset correlations with CES-D (notably trait anxiety and self-esteem) point in opposite directions for this participant: trait anxiety suggests greater depressive symptom burden while high self-esteem suggests lower burden. On balance, the risk signals are present but generally moderate in magnitude and partially offset by multiple functioning and resilience indicators.

Assessment relative to the study distribution: Evidence consistent with a low/median CES-D score (bottom 50%) includes high self-esteem (r = -0.71), high academic functioning, regular exercise, low substance use, and reasonable health satisfaction. Evidence consistent with a higher CES-D score (top 50%) includes elevated trait anxiety (STAI) with strong dataset-level association to CES-D, elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), objectively short and late sleep, blunted circadian amplitude and increased intraday variability, and a moderately higher resting heart rate. Given the mix of moderate risk signals that are offset by substantial protective and functional markers, the overall pattern best supports a CES-D level that is not in the highest half of the distribution. The balance of high self-esteem and preserved functioning argues against placement in the top 50% for depressive symptom burden despite some concerning indicators.

63138,8.0,0.36787564766839376,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports moderate trait anxiety (STAI = 40, Z ≈ -0.13) but relatively high self-regard and positive affect (Rosenberg self‑esteem = 38, Z ≈ -0.03; Current happiness = 4.0, Z ≈ 0.55). Perceived stress is elevated relative to the study mean (PSS = 23, Z ≈ 0.38) but not extreme. Global health satisfaction and academic performance are high (multiple GPAs ~3.8–3.9; health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.38). Correlational patterns in the dataset show that higher anxiety is strongly associated with higher CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81) and higher self‑esteem is strongly associated with lower CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), indicating that these two self‑report dimensions are important, opposing influences on depressive symptom burden for this participant. Overall, the self‑report profile contains several protective signals (high self‑esteem, reported happiness, good academic functioning) alongside modest risk signals (elevated perceived stress, some trait anxiety).

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart‑rate cosinor parameters indicate a well‑defined daily rhythm with a mesor slightly above the sample mean (Mesor = 77.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0.44) and a relatively large amplitude (13.5, Z ≈ 0.88), with acrophase in the late afternoon (≈5:09 PM). Interdaily stability is near average (0.43, Z ≈ 0.17) while intradaily variability is elevated (0.71, Z ≈ 1.16), suggesting greater within‑day fragmentation of heart‑rate activity even though day‑to‑day timing is reasonably stable. Resting heart rate is modestly higher than average (62.9 bpm, Z ≈ 0.56). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor are consistent with a nocturnal trough and an afternoon/evening peak (largest positive deviations late afternoon/early evening), consistent with an intact but somewhat accentuated diurnal rhythm. Taken together these wearable signals indicate an overall preserved circadian structure but with higher short‑term variability and slightly elevated cardiovascular tone—features that can accompany stress or elevated arousal but are not uniquely diagnostic of depressive symptomatology in isolation.

Sleep timing and quantity: Objective sleep metrics show long typical sleep duration (median 8 h 21 m, Z ≈ 1.45) with low day‑to‑day variability in both duration (SD 66 min, Z ≈ -0.8) and start time (median start ≈ 01:37 AM, SD ≈ 58 min, Z ≈ -0.54). The participant reports essentially no napping and shows a late sleep schedule. Long sleep duration in the context of a late schedule can reflect either healthy recovery or hypersomnolent patterns; in this dataset median sleep duration has essentially no correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.0), and sleep timing variability is low, which argues against pronounced sleep instability commonly associated with higher depressive burden.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports regular moderate alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.94–1.01) but no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use, limited solo exercise, and low engagement in sedentary hobbies and gaming. Socializing time is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.62) but not absent. Academic performance is strong. Trust and health satisfaction are above average (Z ≈ 0.5 and 0.38 respectively). Many of these lifestyle indicators (high academic functioning, high self‑esteem, low drug use, reasonable social contact) are typically protective against elevated depressive symptoms. Limited frequency of exercise and somewhat reduced in‑person social time are potential risk factors but correlate only modestly with CES‑D in the provided data.

Integrative assessment of depressive symptom burden: Weighing multimodal evidence, protective indicators predominate. High self‑esteem, above‑average happiness and health satisfaction, strong academic performance, and absence of drug use argue for relatively low depressive symptom burden compared with the sample. Modest risk signals include elevated perceived stress, some trait anxiety, elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (suggesting within‑day rhythm fragmentation), a late sleep schedule, and relatively frequent alcohol use; these could elevate risk but the magnitudes and the provided CES‑D correlations for most wearable metrics are small. The combination of strong protective self‑report measures and generally preserved circadian structure suggests the participant is more likely to fall at or below the median CES‑D in this population rather than in the upper half.

16654,0.0,0.015544041450777202,"Self-report measures indicate a psychological profile more consistent with low-to-moderate depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72) is below the sample mean and correlates strongly with CES-D in the cohort (r = 0.81), which suggests lower anxiety-related risk for depressive symptoms in this participant. Global self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11) and strongly inversely related to CES-D in the study (r = -0.71), providing further evidence toward lower depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is modest (PSS score = 20, Z = -0.44) and reported current happiness is slightly below average (happiness Z = -0.53; happiness correlates moderately negatively with CES-D, r = -0.46), so there is a small countervailing signal of lower momentary positive affect but not a strong pattern of elevated distress across trait measures.

Behavioral and social lifestyle indicators are generally protective relative to the study population. The participant reports frequent social activity (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = 0.95) and regular group exercise (exercised with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23), both of which are associated with lower depressive symptoms in the literature and show slight negative correlations with CES-D in this dataset. Alcohol use is present at a modest weekly level (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week, Z ≈ 1.0) but recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Health satisfaction is high (6/7, Z = 1.3) and body mass index is in the healthy range (BMI = 22.3), which together align with lower CES-D correlations observed here (health satisfaction r ≈ -0.39).

Objective sleep and circadian physiology support a pattern of regular, sufficient sleep and a well-structured circadian rhythm. Median nightly sleep duration is near eight hours (7 h 46 m, Z = 0.73) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 55 minutes, Z = -1.04) and tightly clustered sleep onset times (median start ~01:37, start-time SD = 30 minutes, Z = -1.17). Although the self-report PSQI score (6) crosses a common threshold for mild sleep disturbance, objective Fitbit-derived metrics show stable sleep quantity and timing, which are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show relatively high interdaily stability (0.54, Z = 1.08) and a large amplitude (15.22, Z = 1.44), indicating a strong, regular daily rhythm; these features do not point toward the flattened rhythms often seen with higher depressive symptomatology in this cohort (interdaily stability correlation with CES-D ≈ 0.0, amplitude r ≈ -0.09).

Aggregated heart-rate patterns reflect a robust diurnal profile without clear signs of pathological nocturnal arousal. Resting heart rate is within a healthy range (59.7 bpm, Z = 0.18). Hourly deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations ~ -24 bpm in early morning) and daytime/early-evening elevations peaking in the early afternoon (+18.8 bpm at 1–2 pm). Several evening hours show above-mesor values (e.g., 10–12 pm positive deviations with Zs ≈ 1.1–1.3), but overall the cosinor summary (MESOR, amplitude, acrophase ~5:23 pm) and modest intradaily variability (0.58, Z = 0.24) indicate preserved circadian organization rather than the dysregulated or blunted patterns sometimes associated with higher CES-D scores. Small positive correlations between resting heart rate and CES-D (r ≈ 0.19) suggest vigilance to elevated physiological arousal when interpreting isolated heart-rate elevations, but the participant’s overall physiological profile is not strongly indicative of elevated depressive symptomatology.

Integrated interpretation and weighing of evidence: multiple converging lines (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, low perceived stress, robust social engagement, frequent group exercise, high health satisfaction, sufficient and regular sleep, and strong circadian rhythm amplitude/interdaily stability) point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. The main contrary signals are a modestly elevated PSQI score indicating subjective sleep disturbance and somewhat lower self-reported current happiness; these are notable but modest in magnitude and are offset by stronger protective indicators. Given the balance of objective and subjective measures and their known correlations with CES-D in this sample, the overall evidence favors placement in the lower half of the distribution for depressive symptoms.

29134,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33, classified “not anxious”) and high self-esteem (RSES = 39 of 40, Z = 0.11). Current self-reported happiness is slightly above average (score 4.0, Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17). These three measures are among the strongest correlates of CES-D in the sample (STAI correlates 0.81 with CES-D; self-esteem correlates -0.71; current happiness correlates -0.46), and the participant’s profile on these high-weight variables is protective: low anxiety, high self-esteem, and above-average happiness would be expected to associate with lower depressive symptom burden.

Sleep: Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, classified as “Disturbed Sleep,” Z = 1.98), indicating notable perceived sleep problems. Objective Fitbit-derived sleep duration shows a median nightly sleep of about 7 hours 40 minutes (Z = 0.6), which is slightly above average, but there is substantial variability in both duration (SD = 159 minutes, Z = 1.33) and especially in sleep timing (median sleep start 01:13 AM; sleep start SD = 183 minutes, Z = 2.2). Napping is minimal (mean daily naps 0.12, Z = 0.61). The pattern—adequate median duration but large variability and very irregular sleep timing, alongside a high PSQI—reflects discordance between objective quantity and subjective quality. Because sleep variability and unstable sleep timing are positively correlated with CES-D in the sample (sleep variability correlations ~0.20–0.22), the participant’s irregular sleep schedule provides some signal toward increased depressive symptom risk, though the signal is moderate relative to the stronger psychological-protective measures described above.

Circadian and cardiovascular indicators: Heart-rate–derived circadian summary measures are broadly within a modest range. Mesor (mean level) is slightly below sample average (69.9 bpm, Z = -0.56) and amplitude is lower than average (9.21, Z = -0.51), indicating somewhat blunted rhythmic amplitude; interdaily stability is near average (0.41, Z ≈ 0), and intradaily variability is modestly lower than average (0.52, Z = -0.18). Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33). The hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal heart rate nadir (largest negative deviations in early morning hours) and daytime elevations with a mid-day/early-evening acrophase (reported acrophase ~5:06 PM). Several circadian and heart-rate features have small correlations with CES-D in the sample (mesor and resting HR correlation ~0.19; amplitude correlation ~-0.10), suggesting only a weak link to depressive symptoms. Overall, the participant’s cardiovascular/circadian profile indicates regularity at the day-to-day level but reduced amplitude, which is a mild signal but not a dominant indicator of elevated depressive symptoms.

Behavioral, social, and lifestyle context: The participant engages in frequent group exercise and sports (exercised with others three or more times per week, Z = 1.23; sports three or more times per week, Z = 1.58), reports moderate social contact and leisure usage, and has normal BMI (21.7). Alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2 times per week, Z ≈ 1.0), and recreational drug use is absent. Trust in others and health satisfaction are above average (trust Z = 0.83; health satisfaction Z = 0.55). These lifestyle and social engagement indicators tend to correlate negatively (protectively) with CES-D in the dataset (exercise and social engagement correlations are modestly negative). Taken together, the behavioral and social data point toward protective behavioral patterns (regular activity, sports, social exercise) that are associated with lower depressive symptom levels in the sample.

Synthesis and likelihood of CES-D placement: There are mixed signals but the preponderance of evidence favors a lower depressive symptom burden relative to the study population. Strong predictors of higher CES-D (high trait anxiety and low self-esteem) are absent; instead the participant shows low trait anxiety and very high self-esteem, both of which have the largest sample correlations with CES-D and here indicate lower risk. Objective physiological markers and circadian amplitude are modestly reduced and subjective sleep quality is notably poor with high sleep-timing variability—these aspects provide some evidence toward elevated symptoms but their correlations with CES-D are smaller. Behavioral factors (frequent group exercise, sports, social engagement, normal BMI, above-average health satisfaction) are additional protective signals. Balancing the strong protective psychological indicators against the moderate sleep/circadian risk signals, the overall pattern is more consistent with placement in the lower half of the study CES-D distribution.

Concurrently, global self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29; Z = −1.29). These three self-reported measures form a coherent pattern: high anxiety and stress together with reduced self-regard. The provided score–CES-D correlations indicate strong associations in this sample (STAI–CES-D r ≈ +0.81; Self‑esteem–CES-D r ≈ −0.71), suggesting that the participant’s anxiety and low self-esteem are likely to be accompanied by higher depressive symptom scores relative to the study population. Subjective happiness is modestly above average (current happy = 4.0; Z = +0.55), but its negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46) further underscores that lower mood states would be expected to track with the other risk indicators.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-derived sleep and circadian features show a mixed but somewhat stress-linked profile. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 46 min (Z ≈ −0.52), and the PSQI score is 6 (classified as disturbed sleep), indicating modestly shortened and subjectively disturbed sleep. Sleep timing shows variability (median start ≈ 22:45 with SD ≈ 99 minutes), consistent with some night-to-night irregularity. Heart rate circadian measures show a normal mesor (≈72.9 bpm; Z ≈ −0.15) and a low resting heart rate (≈54.6 bpm; Z ≈ −0.42), but non-parametric rhythm metrics point to elevated fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.70; Z ≈ +1.09) with only modest interdaily stability. The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations reveal pronounced overnight heart-rate drops (large negative deviations around 12–4 AM) and a strong morning rise (peak deviations 6–7 AM; Z ≈ +4.77), consistent with a relatively consolidated nocturnal low and an early-morning activation. Overall, sleep quantity and subjective disturbance combined with higher intradaily variability can be interpreted as contributing to behavioral and physiological stress load that commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral and social activity patterns: The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others, and sports three times a week or more; Zs +1.07 to +1.58), which is a protective behavioral feature and is weakly inversely correlated with CES‑D in the dataset. Substance use is absent. However, leisure patterns include relatively high engagement in sedentary and solitary activities (video games Z ≈ +2.47; listening to music Z ≈ +2.06; sedentary hobby Z ≈ +2.01) while time socializing with friends is below average (Z ≈ −0.62). This combination suggests that although the participant is physically active, social connectedness may be limited and leisure is oriented toward solitary, sedentary pursuits—patterns that are often associated with elevated depressive symptoms in student samples. Academic functioning (GPA) appears strong, which may buffer risk to some degree.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Multiple converging indicators point toward an elevated depressive symptom burden relative to the study sample. The strongest signals are psychological: elevated trait anxiety and very high perceived stress together with lower self-esteem—each strongly associated with higher CES‑D scores in the sample (notably the high STAI–CES‑D and low self‑esteem–CES‑D correlations). Sleep disturbance and elevated intradaily variability add physiological and behavioral evidence consistent with greater symptom burden. Protective factors (regular exercise, absence of substance use, good academic performance, and relatively low BMI) are present and may mitigate risk but do not fully counterbalance the prominent psychological risk markers. On balance, the preponderance and magnitude of risk-relevant indicators suggest that the participant’s CES‑D score is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators also align with lower depressive symptom risk. The participant reports no use of alcohol, wine/liquor, or recreational/non-prescribed drugs (z-scores markedly below sample means), and exercises frequently (exercised alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07). Social and recreational engagement is modest (socializing ~31 minutes/hour, Z = -0.62; reading and light hobbies are present), and health satisfaction is relatively high (score = 5, Z = 0.55; CES-D correlation -0.39). These behavioral patterns — regular physical activity, low substance use, and reasonable social/leisure activity — are generally associated with lower depressive symptomatology in this sample.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics indicate regular, adequate sleep timing and a well-structured daily rhythm. Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 h 56 min (Z = -0.31) with a moderate night-to-night SD of ~61 minutes (Z = -0.91), and median sleep start time near 01:00. The Fitbit-derived nonparametric circadian indices show relatively high interdaily stability (0.59, Z = 1.49) and low intradaily variability (0.37, Z = -1.24), consistent with stable, regular day-to-day activity rhythms. The PSQI score of 4 (Z = -1.26) further indicates subjectively good sleep quality. Together, objective and subjective sleep/circadian indicators favor a profile not characteristic of elevated depressive symptoms.

Cardiovascular physiology and aggregated hourly heart rate patterns reinforce the impression of low physiological arousal at rest and intact diurnal modulation. Resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99) and the cosinor-derived mesor is somewhat below the sample mean (67.8, Z = -0.84); amplitude is modestly elevated (13.48, Z = 0.87) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (4:28 PM). Hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines and mid-day/afternoon elevations in heart rate, indicating normal day–night separation of activity and rest. Correlations between these heart-rate parameters and CES-D are small in this sample; nonetheless, the combination of low resting HR, regular circadian structure, and normal diurnal heart rate variation is more consistent with lower depressive symptom burden than with the physiological dysregulation often seen with higher CES-D scores.

Risk indicators are limited and comparatively minor. The participant reports relatively low interpersonal trust (score = 2.67, Z = -1.10), which in the sample correlates modestly with CES-D (r = -0.41), implying that lower trust can be associated with higher depressive symptoms; however, this is an isolated finding amid multiple other indicators suggesting lower symptom burden. Perceived stress is near sample-average and not markedly elevated. No strong behavioral or physiological markers point toward elevated depression severity.

Weighing self-report, behavioral, sleep/circadian, and physiological evidence holistically, the preponderance of indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, above-average happiness, good subjective and objective sleep, regular circadian rhythms, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and minimal substance use) point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden compared with the study population. Although low interpersonal trust is a potential countervailing signal, it is not supported by other domains. Therefore the participant is most consistent with being in the bottom half of the CES-D distribution.

49086,1.0,0.04145077720207254,"Self-report measures present more evidence for relatively lower depressive symptom burden than for elevated burden. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) is substantially below the sample mean and the STAI–CES-D correlation is strongly positive, so this low anxiety score points toward lower concurrent depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is elevated relative to peers (SelfEsteem Z = 1.1; score reported above the usual scale maximum but the standardized value indicates high self-regard) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D, which again suggests protection against higher depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is modestly below the sample mean (Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is mildly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38), both of which point in the direction of some affective strain; however, their effect sizes (correlations with CES-D) are smaller than those for STAI and self-esteem.

Behavioral and social indices are mixed but include factors associated with lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports relatively high social time with friends (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z = 0.83), both of which correlate negatively with CES-D and are typically protective. Substance use is low to moderate and recreational drug use is absent. A notable behavioral risk domain is physical activity: the participant reports no exercise (large negative Z-scores for exercising alone and with others), which often relates to higher depressive symptoms; in this dataset the exercise–CES-D correlations are small to modest, so the absence of exercise represents a potential but not decisive risk indicator.

Sleep and circadian physiology yield a largely normative picture with a few nuances. Median nightly sleep duration is adequate (7 h 18 m, Z = 0.15) though the PSQI score (6) meets a common threshold for disturbed sleep, indicating some subjective sleep difficulties. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~02:19 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈78 minutes), signaling a delayed sleep schedule rather than short sleep. Wearable-derived circadian metrics show modestly reduced amplitude and MESOR (amplitude Z ≈ -0.57; MESOR Z ≈ -0.61) but preserved stability and low intradaily fragmentation (interdaily stability and intradaily variability near sample mean). Resting heart rate is low-normal (56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22). Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show elevated relative activity around midnight (12–1am, Z = 1.66) and a clear dip across the early-morning sleep window; these patterns are consistent with late sleep timing rather than gross circadian disruption. Overall, objective sleep duration and circadian regularity do not strongly indicate elevated depressive symptomatology, although the late timing and subjective PSQI score could contribute modestly to mood symptoms.

Integrating modalities, the strongest, most consistent protective signals are low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, substantial social engagement, and physiological markers consistent with good cardiovascular conditioning (low resting heart rate and preserved circadian regularity). Risk signals that could elevate depressive symptoms are moderate perceived stress, slightly lower momentary happiness, absence of regular exercise, and a borderline PSQI indicating disturbed sleep; these signals are present but smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with CES-D in this sample than the protective indicators. Academic performance (GPAs) is high, which is typically associated with functioning that would not support a high depressive symptom burden.

Weighing all available evidence, the balance favors a relatively low-to-moderate level of depressive symptoms compared with the study population. Protective factors (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, strong social engagement, adequate sleep duration, and low resting heart rate) are prominent and have comparatively strong associations with CES-D in this dataset; risk factors are present but weaker. On balance, the participant is more consistent with a CES-D score in the lower half of the study distribution.

95490,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56) and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 34; Z = −0.59). Both of these measures have strong correlations with CES-D in the study sample (STAI r ≈ 0.81; Self-Esteem r ≈ −0.71), indicating that in this cohort higher anxiety proneness and lower self-worth co-occur with greater depressive symptom burden. Complementary self-report items show lower-than-average momentary happiness (Current Happy Z = −0.53) and modestly elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38), which align with a pattern of higher internalizing symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 6), a known correlate of depressive symptoms in student samples.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a median nocturnal sleep duration of about 6 hours 56 minutes (Z = −0.30), with substantial night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 101 min, Z = 0.40) and in total-sleep variability (SD ≈ 103 min). The participant’s typical sleep onset is relatively late (median start ≈ 1:11 AM). Circadian regularity metrics are notable for low interdaily stability (value 0.23; Z = −1.48) and reduced amplitude (Z = −0.79), together indicating a relatively weak and irregular 24-hour structure to heart-rate rhythms across the recording period. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z = 0.39), consistent with fragmentation or variability of daily activity/physiology. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly above the sample mean (RHR 61.4, Mesor 77.1; both Z ≈ 0.4), but hourly deviations show typical nocturnal drops and a pronounced evening elevation in mean heart rate (largest positive deviations mid-to-late afternoon and early evening). Overall, these objective markers—irregular circadian rhythm, late/variable sleep timing, and disturbed subjective sleep—are patterns that often accompany elevated depressive symptomatology.

Behaviors and social/contextual features: The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07) and above-average socializing time (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95). Alcohol use is present at moderate weekly levels (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Academic performance (recent GPAs 3.18–3.60) and moderate health satisfaction (Z ≈ −0.28) do not indicate clear functional impairment. Social engagement and regular exercise are protective factors that may mitigate affective symptoms; however, exercise appears predominantly solitary and social time—while relatively high—does not by itself offset the other internalizing indicators.

Integrated interpretation relative to depressive symptom burden: Several high-weight indicators in this participant’s profile point toward an elevated CES-D score relative to the sample. The strongest signals are elevated trait anxiety and reduced self-esteem, both of which have high study correlations with CES-D; these align with lower momentary happiness and disturbed subjective sleep. Objective physiology corroborates vulnerability: low interdaily stability, reduced circadian amplitude, and late/variable sleep timing are patterns frequently associated with greater depressive symptoms. Countervailing evidence includes regular solitary exercise and above-average socializing, and absence of substance misuse; these features are protective and argue against very severe functional impairment. Balancing these data, the preponderance of strong internalizing indicators (anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, circadian irregularity) suggests the participant’s CES-D burden is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

90079,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Trait and symptom self-report: The participant’s survey profile shows several protective trait features alongside modest symptom signals. Trait anxiety on the STAI is 38 (z ≈ -0.33; classified “not anxious”), and self-esteem is relatively high at 34 (z ≈ -0.59). Both of these measures are strongly associated with CES-D in the study sample (STAI–CES-D correlation ≈ 0.81; Self‑Esteem–CES-D ≈ -0.71), and the participant’s lower anxiety and higher self‑esteem therefore argue against a high depressive symptom burden. Current self-rated happiness is slightly below the sample mean (score 3.0, z ≈ -0.53) and perceived stress is above average (PSS = 24, z ≈ 0.65), which provide countervailing signals consistent with some transient distress but not necessarily high chronic depressive symptoms. Interpersonal trust is low (z ≈ -1.42), a factor that in this dataset correlates moderately with higher CES‑D (corr ≈ -0.41) and may reflect weaker perceived social resources.

Sleep quantity, timing, and regularity: Objective sleep and sleep timing show notable disturbances. Median nightly sleep is short at 5 hours 54 minutes (z ≈ -1.59) with a large night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 138 min, z ≈ 0.84); median sleep start is late (~01:53) with moderate variability. The PSQI score is 7, classed as “disturbed sleep.” Short, irregular, and delayed sleep timing are behavioral patterns often associated with mood symptoms; in this dataset sleep duration had minimal direct correlation to CES‑D but disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI >5) and large variability can contribute to functional impairment and elevated symptom reports. Overall, the wearable and self‑reported sleep indices indicate clinically relevant sleep disturbance that could elevate risk for mood symptoms even if other trait measures are protective.

Circadian and activity structure: Heart rate–derived circadian metrics indicate reduced 24‑hour regularity and blunted rhythm amplitude. Interdaily stability is low (0.21, z ≈ -1.65) and intradaily variability is elevated (0.75, z ≈ 1.44), with amplitude below the sample mean (6.53, z ≈ -1.37) and a mesor near the sample mean (76.9 bpm, z ≈ 0.41). These metrics describe an overall pattern of inconsistent daily structure and more fragmented within‑day physiology. Although the study correlations provided show only weak associations between these specific circadian features and CES‑D, the combination of low stability, high fragmentation, and blunted amplitude is behaviorally consistent with disrupted circadian functioning, which can contribute to sleep problems and mood dysregulation.

Autonomic tone and hourly heart rate: Resting heart rate is modestly elevated relative to the sample (65.6 bpm, z ≈ 0.89) and the hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal declines and daytime rises around the participant’s acrophase (~4:54 PM). Resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (≈ 0.19). The cardiovascular profile therefore provides weak-to-moderate supportive evidence of physiological arousal that can accompany stress or disturbed sleep, but it is not a strong signal for elevated depressive symptomatology on its own.

Behavioral context and social/leisure activity: The participant reports minimal substance use, modest levels of exercise (exercising alone and with others 1–2 times/week), limited sedentary hobbies, and moderate socializing (1–2 hours/day). Listening to music and internet use are higher than some peers. Overall, social and recreational engagement is present but not extensive; interpersonal trust is low, which may limit perceived social support. These behavioral features are mixed with respect to CES‑D risk: low substance use and some social/exercise engagement are protective, while low trust and limited routine could modestly increase vulnerability.

Integrated interpretation relative to CES‑D distribution: Balancing the signals, the strongest dataset‑level predictors of higher CES‑D (trait anxiety and low self‑esteem) are not present here—STAI is within the non‑anxious range and self‑esteem is relatively high—both features that strongly predict lower CES‑D in this sample. Countervailing factors include objectively short and irregular sleep, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI >5), elevated perceived stress, low interpersonal trust, and signs of circadian fragmentation; these are relevant risk indicators but in this dataset generally show weaker correlations with CES‑D than the trait measures. Taken together, the preponderance of evidence (particularly the low anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem, plus only moderate stress and mixed behavioral engagement) is more consistent with CES‑D scores at or below the population median rather than in the upper half of the distribution. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study distribution for CES‑D.

22842,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"Self-report measures indicate a profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety and subjectively disturbed sleep together with modest reductions in positive affect. The participant’s STAI–Trait score (46; Z = 0.46) is in the upper half of the sample distribution and the dataset notes a strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D (r ≈ 0.81); this provides a robust signal linking chronic anxiety-proneness to higher depressive symptom scores in this cohort. Self-esteem is slightly below the study mean (RSES = 36; Z ≈ -0.31) and bears a substantial negative relation to CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), but the participant’s self-esteem is not extremely low. Perceived stress is near average (PSS = 22; Z ≈ 0.1) and self-reported current happiness is somewhat lower than average (score = 3.0; Z ≈ -0.53), both of which are consistent with some affective strain but not uniquely diagnostic. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is elevated (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ 1.52), indicating clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, a factor commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a mixed pattern of adequate aggregate sleep duration but marked timing irregularity and circadian dampening. Median nightly sleep duration is near 7 hours 51 minutes (Z ≈ 0.83), suggesting total sleep time is on the healthy side on average; however, sleep timing is very late (median sleep start ≈ 02:56) and highly variable (sleep start SD Z ≈ 1.79). Mean daily naps are relatively frequent (mean = 0.28 naps/day; Z ≈ 2.4). Circadian rhythm features derived from heart rate indicate reduced rhythmicity and amplitude (interdaily stability = 0.30, Z ≈ -0.9; amplitude = 8.7, Z ≈ -0.67; MESOR slightly below average), which together with late, irregular sleep timing suggests a blunted and shifted daily pattern. Resting heart rate is relatively low for the sample (54.2 bpm; Z ≈ -0.47); hourly aggregated deviations from mesor reveal the expected nocturnal nadir and evening elevations, but the primary wearable signals relevant to mood are the low interdaily stability and high variability in sleep timing—both of which have modest positive correlations with CES-D in the dataset and are empirically linked to depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral and lifestyle variables provide mixed protective and risk-relevant information. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (≥3 times/week; Z ≈ 1.07), low substance use, minimal recreational drug use, and moderate social time (1–2 hours/day), all factors that are generally protective or neutral with respect to depressive symptoms in population studies. Conversely, relatively high time spent playing video games (Z ≈ 1.71) and low engagement in some recreational activities (e.g., listening to music, reading) could reflect limited rewarding social/leisure diversification, but these associations with CES-D are weaker in the provided correlations. Health satisfaction is above average (score 5.44; Z ≈ 0.88), which would tend to offset risk. Overall, behavioral data do not strongly indicate severe functional impairment but do not fully counterbalance the sleep and anxiety signals.

Holistic integration and ranking rationale: the participant shows two relatively strong risk signals for elevated CES-D relative to the cohort—elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and marked subjective sleep disturbance with late and irregular sleep timing—both of which have meaningful correlations with CES-D in the dataset. These are complemented by circadian measures consistent with reduced rhythmic robustness (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude), and modest markers such as daytime napping and lower reported happiness that align with greater depressive symptom burden. Offsetting factors include adequate total sleep duration on average, frequent exercise, low substance use, and reasonably preserved self-esteem and health satisfaction. On balance, given the strong predictive relation between anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample and the pronounced objective/subjective sleep irregularity, the preponderance of evidence supports the participant having a CES-D score in the higher half of the study distribution.

14279,5.0,0.19689119170984457,"Psychological trait profile and self-report correlates:
The participant’s trait-level measures show a mixed but overall resilient pattern relative to the study sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z ≈ -0.33) is below the study mean and therefore does not indicate elevated chronic anxiety proneness; given the strong positive population correlation between STAI and CES-D (r ≈ 0.81), this lower-than-average trait anxiety is an indicator that depressive symptom burden is likely to be lower rather than higher. Self-esteem is at the maximum reported value on the scale (Rosenberg = 40, z ≈ 0.26), and self-esteem correlates negatively with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), which represents a relatively strong protective factor against depressive symptomatology. Current self-reported happiness is somewhat below average (score = 3, z ≈ -0.53) and interpersonal trust is markedly low (z ≈ -1.74); both lower happiness and lower trust are associated with higher CES-D in the cohort (happiness r ≈ -0.46, trust r ≈ -0.42), so these specific self-reports provide some countervailing evidence toward greater depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is modest (PSS = 20, z ≈ -0.44) and does not suggest elevated stress relative to peers.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep quality:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate relatively long and regular sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 8 h 11 m (z ≈ +1.24) with modest night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 93 min, z ≈ -0.19) and infrequent naps. Median sleep start time (~00:18) with moderate variability is consistent with a late-but-regular student sleep schedule. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7) crosses the common threshold for “disturbed sleep,” indicating the participant reports some sleep-related difficulties despite objectively long sleep duration. The sample correlations suggest sleep duration itself has little relation to CES-D (r ≈ 0), while variability has a small positive correlation (r ≈ 0.20); here the participant’s objective regularity is not indicative of higher depressive symptoms, but the elevated PSQI suggests subjective sleep problems that could modestly relate to mood.

Circadian and autonomic physiology:
Heart-rate based circadian metrics show a relatively robust and structured rhythm. Nonparametric regularity features (interdaily stability z ≈ +0.58; intradaily variability z ≈ +0.53) and a high amplitude (z ≈ +1.11) together indicate a clear day–night modulation of cardiovascular activity with somewhat elevated daytime–nighttime contrast. The cosinor MESOR and resting heart rate are within typical bounds (resting HR = 59 bpm, z ≈ +0.1; MESOR z ≈ +0.41), and the aggregated hourly deviations show large nocturnal heart-rate troughs and pronounced daytime peaks (notably around midday and early evening). These objective rhythm features (robust amplitude and reasonable interdaily stability) are generally associated with lower risk of affective dysregulation in the literature and in the cohort correlations (amplitude correlates modestly negative with CES-D). There is no clear signal of blunted diurnal variation or high nocturnal arousal that would be expected to accompany elevated depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral activities and social engagement:
The participant reports moderate social engagement (socializing 1–2 hours, z ≈ +0.16) and participates in group exercise and sports at a frequency above the cohort mean (exercised with others and sports ~1–2×/week; z ≈ +0.5–0.9), which are behavioral features typically linked to lower depressive symptoms. Leisure patterns show minimal engagement in some sedentary or solitary hobbies (e.g., listening to music, reading, sedentary hobbies coded as “do not do” with negative z-scores), which could reflect personal preference or reduced engagement in certain pleasure activities; these specific leisure reductions have small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D in the sample. Substance use is moderate (wine 1–2×/week, z ≈ +0.94) but other substance use is low; this pattern does not strongly indicate elevated depressive symptoms based on available correlations.

Integration and inference regarding depressive symptom burden:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, protective signals are prominent: relatively low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, organized and high-amplitude circadian physiology, long and regular objective sleep duration, normative resting heart rate, and active participation in group exercise and sports. These features, particularly the strong negative association of self-esteem and the strong positive association of trait anxiety with CES-D in the cohort, favor a lower CES-D score relative to the study population. Countervailing indicators include a PSQI score indicating subjective sleep disturbance, lower momentary happiness, markedly low interpersonal trust, and reduced engagement in some leisure activities; these relate to higher CES-D but are of smaller magnitude in the context of the stronger protective signals described above. Several wearable–CESD correlations for the participant’s prominent physiological features (e.g., amplitude, interdaily stability) are weak or point toward lower depressive symptomatology. Overall, the preponderance of evidence supports a position in the lower half of the CES-D distribution for this participant.

28327,33.0,0.9430051813471503,"The self-report profile indicates a cluster of affective and cognitive risk factors commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65) is markedly elevated relative to the study population, and this measure shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.81), suggesting anxiety-proneness is tightly coupled with depressive symptoms for this individual. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 26; Z = -1.71) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.70), consistent with a cognitive vulnerability pattern (low self-worth) that typically co-occurs with higher depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2; Z = -1.61; r = -0.46), and perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65; r = 0.28), which together point toward affective distress and negative subjective appraisal that align with higher CES-D values. Health satisfaction is also low (Z = -1.86), a factor often associated with increased reporting of depressive symptoms.

Subjective and objective sleep/circadian data present a mixed picture but include salient indicators relevant to depressive symptoms. The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 9; Z = 1.05) despite an objectively adequate median nightly sleep duration (median = 7 h 37 min; Z = 0.54). Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 00:54) with modest night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 68 minutes; Z = -0.33). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show moderate interdaily stability (0.49; Z = 0.67) but elevated intradaily variability (0.69; Z = 1.02), indicating fragmentation in within-day heart rate dynamics. The cosinor amplitude is relatively high (amplitude = 14.01; Z = 1.04) and acrophase in the early evening (≈5:17 PM), with large evening heart-rate deviations (notably 6–8 PM with Z-scores up to ~2.2). These objective signs—sleep timing misalignment, subjective sleep complaints, and within-day physiological fragmentation—are consistent with physiological correlates that often accompany higher depressive symptom reports, even when total sleep time is not reduced.

Behavioral and social metrics show a combination of potential protective and risk factors. The participant reports regular moderate exercise (1–2 times/week alone and with others) and limited use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs; alcohol consumption is occasional (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week). Trust is relatively high (Z = 1.47), which can be a social resource, but time spent socializing is below average (Z = -0.62), and sedentary recreational hobbies are minimal. Academic performance (GPA across terms) is strong, which may reflect preserved functioning in some domains. Listening to music is comparatively high (2–3 hours; Z = 1.13), which could reflect mood-regulating behaviors. Overall, lifestyle data indicate some adaptive behaviors (exercise, low substance use, high trust, strong GPA) that could mitigate symptom burden, but reduced social engagement and reported low happiness counterbalance those protections.

Integrative assessment weighing the multimodal evidence favors elevated depressive symptom burden relative to the study sample. The most heavily weighted signals are the very high trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D), markedly low self-esteem (strong negative correlation), low self-reported happiness, and disturbed subjective sleep—each of which shows medium-to-large associations with CES-D scores in this dataset. Objective physiology (circadian fragmentation, pronounced evening arousal) and reduced socializing add convergent support. Offsetting factors—adequate objective sleep duration, moderate regularity in circadian timing, moderate exercise, low substance use, and strong academic performance—suggest preserved functioning in some domains but do not outweigh the pattern of internalizing risk markers that align with higher CES-D. On balance, the pattern is more consistent with placement in the upper half of the study distribution for depressive symptoms.

Perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 21; Z ≈ -0.17) and trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 43; Z ≈ 0.17, classified as “anxious”); trait anxiety has a strong positive study-level correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.82), so the participant’s non-elevated STAI z-score tempers but does not eliminate concern that anxiety-related symptoms could co-occur with depressive symptoms. Sleep quality by self-report is just above the common PSQI clinical cutoff (PSQI = 6; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which could reflect subjective sleep difficulties despite objective metrics described below.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics indicate generally consolidated nocturnal sleep with late and somewhat variable timing. Median sleep duration is relatively long (≈8 h 6 min; Z ≈ 1.14) but night-to-night variability is elevated (sleep duration SD ≈ 123 minutes; Z ≈ 0.51) and the median sleep start time is late (≈01:08 AM) with moderate variability (start time SD Z ≈ 0.43). These features indicate adequate total sleep time on average, but irregular timing and variability that can be associated with mood symptoms. Heart-rate based circadian summaries suggest preserved 24-hour structure: mesor and resting heart rate are lower than the sample mean (Mesor ≈ 71.9 bpm Z ≈ -0.28; RHR ≈ 52.5 bpm Z ≈ -0.67), amplitude is moderately above average (Z ≈ 0.5), intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -0.95) and interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.33). Aggregated hourly deviations show the expected large overnight decreases in heart rate and daytime peaks across the early-to-mid afternoon, indicating a coherent day–night rhythm with limited within-day fragmentation — a pattern more consistent with lower symptom burden than with severe circadian disruption.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are generally protective relative to depressive symptomatology. The participant reports little-to-no substance use (no beer, wine/liquor, or recreational drug use; negative z-scores), regular social engagement (socializing with friends reported 3–4 hours; Z ≈ 1.74) and routine moderate physical activity (exercise and sports 1–2 times per week; positive Z-scores). Screen-based recreation (video games, internet, TV) is higher than average, but correlations of these activities with CES-D in the sample are modest. Overall health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.13) and body mass index is in the healthy range, both of which align with lower depressive symptom risk.

Integrated interpretation and CES-D placement: weighing convergent signals, the strongest protective indicators are high self-esteem, above-average momentary happiness, low substance use, substantial social engagement, coherent heart-rate circadian structure (low intradaily variability, preserved amplitude and overnight decline), and a relatively low resting heart rate. Risk signals include a mildly elevated trait anxiety score, subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI, and objectively late and moderately irregular sleep timing—features that can be associated with depressive symptoms but which are not dominant here. Given the balance of evidence, particularly the strong inverse marker of self-esteem and the objective circadian coherence, the participant’s overall pattern is more consistent with relatively low-to-average depressive symptoms compared with the study population. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the CES-D distribution.

Hourly deviations from mesor display the expected nocturnal decline in heart rate and pronounced positive deviation in the late afternoon/early evening (especially 5–6 PM, z ≈ 2.27). Resting heart rate is near the population mean (57.8 bpm, z ≈ -0.04). Taken together, these patterns reflect a relatively robust and regular circadian organization of cardiovascular activity and discrete periods of elevated evening arousal, rather than a blunted or highly irregular physiological profile often associated with severe mood disturbance.

Sleep: Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show a median nightly duration near eight hours (7 h 44 m; z ≈ 0.69), low variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 64 min; z ≈ -0.84), infrequent naps, but a late median sleep onset time (≈ 01:49 AM) and modest variability around that time. Subjective sleep quality, however, is poor (PSQI = 11, z ≈ 1.98), indicating the participant perceives significant sleep difficulties despite objectively adequate sleep quantity and consistency. This discrepancy—adequate, regular sleep duration but poor subjective sleep quality—can contribute to daytime distress and is often associated with mood symptoms, but in this case objective regularity and absence of fragmented sleep reduce one physiological risk pathway for elevated depressive symptoms.

Self-report psychological and behavioral indicators: Trait measures and behavioral habits generally point away from elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 38, z ≈ -0.03 indicating near-average/high within range) and a STAI–Trait score that is not elevated (38, z ≈ -0.33). Current self-rated happiness is above the mean (z ≈ 0.55) and perceived stress is near average (PSS = 22, z ≈ 0.1). Academic performance is strong (GPAs 3.61–3.94). The participant reports frequent physical activity, especially social exercise and sports (z-scores 1.23 and 1.58 respectively), which are protective behaviors. Areas of relative concern are lower health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2) and poor subjective sleep, modest weekly alcohol use, and somewhat limited in-person socializing time (socializing z ≈ -0.62). Correlational information in the dataset also highlights that higher self-esteem and lower trait anxiety are strongly (and oppositely) related to lower CES-D scores (self-esteem correlation ≈ -0.71; STAI correlation ≈ 0.82), and in this case those measures are favorable.

Integrated assessment regarding depressive symptom burden: Balancing the multimodal evidence, the strongest indicators point toward a relatively low to average depressive symptom burden. Protective signals include high self-esteem, absence of elevated trait anxiety, above-average current happiness, strong academic functioning, regular and robust circadian physiology, consistent objective sleep duration, and frequent physical and social exercise. Risk signals are primarily subjective: marked perceived poor sleep quality (high PSQI), lower satisfaction with physical health, some evening physiological arousal, and modest reductions in in-person socializing. However, the magnitude and consistency of the protective indicators—particularly the combination of low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, active lifestyle, and regular physiological rhythms—outweigh the subjective sleep complaints and isolated risk behaviors. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with CES-D scores in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

93002,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report measures indicate a pattern of psychological and affective vulnerabilities that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 40; Z = -0.13) and lower-than-average self-esteem (RSES = 32; Z = -0.87); these scales have strong associations with CES-D in this sample (STAI r = 0.81; SelfEsteem r = -0.71), so even modest deviations on these measures carry relevance. Current self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0; Z = -0.53; r = -0.46), perceived stress is slightly above average (PSS = 22; Z = 0.10; r = 0.28), and satisfaction with health is low (Z = -0.78; r = -0.39). Taken together, these affective and self-evaluative indicators point toward a profile with multiple psychosocial features that correlate with higher CES-D scores in the study population.

Sleep-related self-report and wearable-derived sleep features further reinforce risk-related signals. The participant’s PSQI score is 9 (Z = 1.05; classified as disturbed sleep), which is a clinically notable level of subjective sleep difficulty and commonly co-occurs with increased depressive symptoms. Objective Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of ~6 hours 28 minutes (Z = -0.88), a late median sleep start time (01:16), and relatively high night-to-night variability in both sleep onset and duration (start-time SD Z = 0.43; duration SD Z = 0.43). Mean daily naps are elevated relative to the sample (0.18 naps/day; Z = 1.21). Short, variable, and late-timed sleep together with elevated subjective sleep disturbance constitute convergent evidence that sleep disruption is present and may contribute to higher CES-D scores.

Physiological and circadian heart-rate features present a mixed but generally non-elevating pattern relative to depressive symptom correlates. The participant’s resting heart rate and overall MESOR are lower than the sample mean (RHR = 48.3 bpm, Z = -1.18; MESOR = 64.9, Z = -1.24); in this dataset MESOR and RHR show modest positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), so the low values here weakly point away from higher CES-D burden. Circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability Z = 0.67; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 0.81) indicate moderately good day-to-day rhythmicity, and intradaily variability is near the sample mean (Z = 0.24). The hourly mean-deviation pattern shows large nocturnal decreases and a pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (notably 7–8 pm Z = 2.16), consistent with a distinct daily activity/arousal rhythm; however, correlations between these heart-rate features and CES-D are generally small. In sum, wearable physiological indices do not provide strong evidence for elevated depressive symptomatology and in some respects (low resting HR, preserved interdaily stability) suggest relative physiological resilience.

Behavioral and lifestyle data provide additional context that is mixed but leans toward psychosocial risk. The participant reports minimal substance use, moderate social activity (socializing 1–2 hours/day; Z ≈ 0.16), and sporadic exercise (exercising with others 1–2 times/week; Z = 0.53), which are neutral-to-protective features. However, greater internet use (2–3 hours/day; Z = 0.85) and minimal engagement in sedentary hobbies or reading may reflect limited restorative leisure. Academic performance is strong (recent GPAs in the 3.35–3.72 range), which is a potential resilience marker. Overall, lifestyle indicators are a mix of protective (low substance use, good GPA, social exercise) and risk-relevant (high internet time, limited restorative hobbies) factors.

Holistic synthesis and ranking: weighing the evidence, the strongest signals linking to higher CES-D come from subjective affect and self-evaluation (low self-esteem, reduced happiness), clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9), and some indices of stress and sleep timing irregularity. Physiological circadian measures and low resting heart rate provide modest countervailing evidence that is unlikely to fully offset the psychosocial and sleep-related risk markers. Given the preponderance of self-report indicators that correlate substantially with CES-D in this sample (notably the high STAI–CES-D correlation and strong negative correlation for self-esteem) alongside objective sleep disturbance, the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s CES-D score would more likely fall in the upper half of the study distribution rather than the lower half.

56543,18.0,0.7461139896373057,"The self-report profile indicates multiple psychological risk markers that are strongly associated with depressive symptomatology in this sample. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 50, z = 0.86) and is highly positively correlated with CES-D in the study data (r ≈ 0.81), suggesting that chronic anxiety-related disposition is a major contributor to probable depressive symptoms for this participant. Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 33, z = -0.73) and shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), which further increases the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25, z = 0.92) and subjective happiness is below average (current happiness z = -0.53), both patterns that align with higher CES-D scores in the cohort. In combination, these self-report measures (high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, elevated stress, and reduced happiness) present a coherent psychological signal pointing toward increased depressive symptom burden.

Sleep self-report and wearable-derived sleep metrics converge on disrupted and shifted sleep consistent with risk for depressive symptoms. The participant reports poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep) while Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep is shorter than the study mean (median 6 h 26 min, z = -0.94). Sleep start timing is substantially delayed (median start ~02:22 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (start time SD ≈ 60 minutes, z ≈ -0.5). These objective and subjective sleep disturbances—shorter sleep, later timing, and poor perceived sleep—are known correlates of greater depressive symptoms and the PSQI result here aligns with that pattern.

Physiological and circadian indicators from the wearable show patterns consistent with elevated arousal and evening-biased activity. Resting heart rate and mesor are both above the study mean (RHR = 68 bpm, z = 1.17; mesor ≈ 82.3, z = 1.14) and the hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced increases in the late evening (notably very large positive deviations 10–11 PM and 11–12 PM, z-scores markedly high). Nonparametric circadian metrics show moderate interdaily stability (z ≈ 0.67) and modest intraday variability (z ≈ 0.32), while cosinor amplitude is near average. Taken together, these data suggest an intact but evening-shifted circadian rhythm with elevated physiological arousal into late evening—an organizational profile that often co-occurs with the late sleep timing and sleep disturbance described above and that has modest positive correlations with CES-D in the sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle data show a mix of protective and risk-related habits. The participant reports exercising alone frequently (three times per week or more, z ≈ 1.07), low substance use, and substantial time spent reading (very high relative to the sample, z ≈ 4.24), which could be protective against depressive symptoms. However, high internet usage (more than 4 hours daily, z ≈ 2.19) and limited social exercise or team activities suggest some lifestyle patterns that correlate positively with CES-D in the cohort. Overall, the behavioral picture is mixed: several healthful practices are present, but they coexist with lifestyle features (late-night activity, high screen time) that tend to relate to higher depressive symptom scores.

Holistic synthesis weighing magnitude and relevant correlations favors classification in the higher half of the CES-D distribution. Several measures with strong study-wide correlations to CES-D—elevated trait anxiety (r ≈ 0.81), low self-esteem (r ≈ -0.71), and disturbed sleep (PSQI elevated)—are all present and of moderate-to-large effect size (z-scores near or above ±0.7–1.0). Physiological indicators (elevated resting HR and evening-biased heart-rate elevations) and behavioral risk markers (late sleep timing, high internet use) further support greater symptom burden. Protective factors exist (regular exercise, low substance use, high reading), but they do not outweigh the consistent pattern of risk across multiple modalities and across measures that have relatively high correlations with CES-D in the sample. On balance, the evidence indicates the participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the top half of the study population distribution.

89142,12.0,0.5362694300518135,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but concerning profile with respect to depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66) and this measure has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.82), which suggests anxiety-related cognitions/affect could contribute to higher CES-D scores. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which likewise points toward greater depressive symptom risk. Current self-rated happiness is modestly below average (Z = -0.53) and overall health satisfaction is markedly low (score = 1, Z = -2.45; r with CES-D ≈ -0.40), both of which are consistent with elevated mood-related distress. Conversely, perceived stress is extremely low (PSS = 0, Z = -5.88), which is atypical and would by itself predict lower CES-D scores, but this apparent absence of perceived stress is discrepant with other indicators (anxiety, low self-esteem, low health satisfaction) and may reflect reporting differences rather than absence of mood symptoms.

Behavioral and social habits in the self-report data show limited social/physical engagement and selective leisure patterns. The participant reports essentially no exercise or team/sports participation (all frequency Z-scores strongly negative) and reduced socializing (Z ≈ -0.62), behaviors that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Substance use is negligible. Time-use shows high relative engagement in solitary, low-activation activities such as reading (Z = 2.28) and elevated time on video games (Z = 1.71), which could reflect compensatory or avoidant behaviors; correlations of these specific activities with CES-D in this sample are small, but the overall pattern (low social/physical activity, more solitary engagement) aligns with risk for higher depressive symptom scores.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian features present a mostly regular circadian structure with a relatively low overall cardiovascular set point. Heart-rate cosinor metrics indicate a low mesor (60.11 bpm, Z = -1.89) and a low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z = -1.49), suggesting a generally lower heart rate baseline. Non-parametric rhythm measures show modest interdaily stability (0.45, Z = 0.33) and relatively low intradaily variability (0.44, Z = -0.74), indicating a reasonably consistent and not highly fragmented daily rhythm across days. The acrophase near mid-afternoon (~3:57 PM) and sizable daytime positive deviations from mesor (peaks in late morning and early evening; e.g., 9–10am and 6–7pm with positive Z-scores) reflect clear daytime elevations and nighttime declines in heart rate. These circadian features — preserved stability and low fragmentation — are generally less consistent with severe depressive circadian disruption and could be protective against high CES-D scores.

Objective sleep metrics are mixed and provide relevant context. Median nightly sleep duration is short (5 hours 50 minutes, Z = -1.68), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD ≈ 123 minutes, Z = 0.51), which are patterns that correlate with greater depressive symptoms in many samples. The median sleep start time is late (≈01:02) with moderate variability (SD ≈ 60 minutes), yet subjective sleep quality per PSQI is within the “good” range (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). Thus, objectively reduced and irregular sleep duration constitutes a risk factor for elevated CES-D, but the participant’s subjective report of good sleep and the wearable-derived circadian regularity present a mixed picture.

Integrative interpretation and ranking decision: strong, high-weight indicators in this case point toward elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant shows elevated trait anxiety (STAI), low self-esteem, low health satisfaction, reduced social and physical activity, and objectively short and variable sleep — all of which have substantive associations with CES-D in the study (notably STAI r = 0.82 and self-esteem r = -0.71). Countervailing signals include an exceptionally low perceived stress score and preserved circadian regularity/low intradaily variability on the wearable metrics, as well as low resting heart rate, which argue against severe functional disruption. Balancing these pieces, the most diagnostically relevant and strongly correlated self-report features (high trait anxiety and low self-esteem) and the objective short sleep pattern favor classification in the higher half of the CES-D distribution. Therefore, taking the multimodal evidence together, the participant is more likely to fall in the top 50% of CES-D scores within this study population.

24898,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"The participant’s self-report profile presents a mixed but largely nonsevere pattern with respect to depressive symptom risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 45, z ≈ 0.37) is elevated relative to the sample and is a strong correlate of CES-D in this population (r ≈ 0.81), indicating anxiety-proneness that is an important risk marker for concurrent depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 31, z ≈ -1.0) and shows a strong negative association with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), which again provides signal consistent with greater vulnerability to depressed mood when compared to peers. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 24, z ≈ 0.65), and subjective sleep quality is just above the conventional threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6), both of which modestly favor higher symptom reporting. At the same time, current self-reported happiness is slightly above average (z ≈ 0.55) and global health satisfaction is relatively high (z ≈ 0.88), suggesting preserved positive appraisal in some domains despite the anxiety and lower self-esteem.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology show a pattern of regularity and resilience rather than the fragmentation often observed with higher depressive symptom burden. Objective median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 14 min, z ≈ -1.18), but sleep timing is consistent (median start ≈ 00:54 with low start-time variability, z ≈ -1.07) and daytime napping is essentially absent. Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate strong structure: high interdaily stability (z ≈ 1.99), low intradaily variability (z ≈ -1.45), elevated amplitude (z ≈ 1.64), and pronounced daytime HR peaks in the afternoon/evening. Resting heart rate is low (49.4 bpm, z ≈ -1.04), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. These objective signatures (regular rhythms, low fragmentation, clear activity-related HR increases) are generally protective or at least not characteristic of severe, prolonged circadian disruption that often accompanies higher depressive symptomatology; most of these wearable features show small or negligible correlations with CES-D in the sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle data further provide protective context: frequent exercise (alone and with others, z-scores >1), engagement in sports (z ≈ 1.58), regular socializing (2–3 hours, z ≈ 0.95), minimal recreational drug or alcohol use, and strong academic performance (GPAs in the mid–high 3.5–3.9 range). Some leisure patterns (heavy music listening, more reading) may reflect solitary or inward-directed time but are not strongly associated with CES-D in the sample. Overall, the combination of social and physical activity, low substance use, and consistent daily structure is more typical of lower-to-average depressive symptom burden.

Integrating the modalities: the clearest signals that would push toward higher depressive symptomatology are elevated trait anxiety and lower self-esteem—both of which are strongly correlated with CES-D in this cohort—and mildly disturbed subjective sleep and elevated perceived stress. However, objective physiology and behavior (robust circadian rhythm, low heart-rate fragmentation, frequent exercise, social engagement, high health satisfaction, strong academic performance, and little substance use) lean toward an overall lower or average symptom burden. Given the relative strength of the wearable and lifestyle protective indicators and the moderate magnitude of the self-report risk signals, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s CES-D score is more likely to be in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not among the highest 50%).

74413,6.0,0.2538860103626943,"Self-report trait and symptom profile:
The participant’s self-report survey pattern shows multiple markers that conventionally associate with lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 31, Z = -1.02) is well below the study mean and the instrument classification indicates “not anxious,” and trait anxiety has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), making the low anxiety score a strong protective indicator. The participant’s self-esteem metric is elevated relative to the sample (RSES Z = 1.1) and the RSES is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), further indicating lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is low (PSS score = 18, Z = -0.98), which is also protective given the positive association between stress and CES-D in this dataset. Current self-reported happiness is modestly below the sample mean (Z = -0.53) and health satisfaction is relatively low (Z = -1.2); both of those scales correlate negatively with mood (lower happiness and lower health satisfaction are associated with higher CES-D), so these two items provide a countervailing signal of mild risk. Overall, the trait and symptom self-reports present a predominantly low-risk profile with a few isolated, modest signals (lower happiness and lower health satisfaction) that could be relevant but do not outweigh the stronger protective markers (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, low perceived stress).

Behavioral lifestyle indicators:
Behavioral habits measured by surveys point toward active, low-risk functioning. The participant reports little-to-no substance use across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs (all Z-scores well below the sample mean), and a relatively high frequency of exercise when alone (three times a week or more; Z = 1.07). Time spent socializing (1–2 hours, Z ≈ 0.16) and reading (Z = 1.3) indicate engagement in social and cognitively stimulating activities, while time on internet/media is notably low (internet usage Z = -2.5). These lifestyle features are generally aligned with lower depressive symptomatology in young adult samples. One behavioral caveat is BMI (27.12), which is above the healthy range; together with lower health satisfaction this could modestly increase risk for mood-related complaints, but the behavioral evidence overall favors lower symptom burden.

Objective sleep and circadian/physiological metrics:
Wearable-recorded sleep and heart-rate rhythm metrics present a mixed but largely normative picture. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 34 minutes (Z = 0.47), and night-to-night sleep duration variability is low (SD = 42 minutes; Z = -1.34), which are generally favorable for mood. The participant’s PSQI, however, is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), suggesting some subjective sleep complaints despite objective indicators of adequate and consistent sleep. Heart-rate circadian metrics show modest regularity but some diurnal fragmentation: interdaily stability is slightly below average (value 0.36, Z = -0.41) while intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.76, Z = 1.51), indicating more within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology. Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33), a marker often associated with good cardiovascular fitness and sometimes with lower mood disorder risk; MESOR and amplitude are near sample means. Hourly aggregated deviations indicate relatively greater evening physiological activation (notably 10–11pm deviation Z = 2.46 and elevated late-evening deviations), and lower heart rate across the early morning hours—this pattern could reflect evening arousal or later activity, though correlations between these hourly deviations and CES-D in the sample are small. In sum, objective sleep duration and regularity are generally protective while elevated intradaily variability and subjective sleep disturbance provide small risk signals; the physiological signal is mixed but does not strongly support elevated depressive symptomatology.

Synthesis and balance of evidence:
When integrating self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological data, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. The most salient protective indicators are low trait anxiety (strongly predictive in this sample), high self-esteem (strong inverse correlation with CES-D), low perceived stress, low substance use, regular exercise, and objectively adequate and consistent sleep duration. The primary risk or ambiguous signals are modest: a PSQI indicating subjective sleep disturbance (score = 6), somewhat reduced self-rated happiness and health satisfaction, elevated intradaily variability (fragmented daily rhythm), elevated BMI, and some evening physiological activation. Many of those risk markers have only small correlations with CES-D in this dataset or are relatively modest in magnitude for this participant; by contrast, the protective indicators (particularly low STAI and high self-esteem) are both strong in magnitude and have strong sample correlations with CES-D. Taken holistically, the preponderance of evidence supports a profile more consistent with CES-D scores in the lower half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

77789,20.0,0.7797927461139896,"Self-report signals present a mixed but generally non-severe profile for depressive symptoms. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, classified “anxious”), which is the strongest single correlate of CES-D in the provided data (correlation = 0.81) and therefore represents the most salient risk indicator for concurrent depressive symptomatology. At the same time, several self-report indicators that typically protect against higher depressive scores are present: self-rated happiness is above the sample mean (Happy = 4, z = 0.55; correlation with CES-D = -0.46), perceived stress is lower than average (PSS score 20, z = -0.44; corr with CES-D = 0.28), and self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 36, z = -0.31; corr with CES-D = -0.71). The PSQI score of 6 meets a conventional threshold for disturbed sleep but is only mildly elevated relative to peers (z ≈ -0.33), suggesting some subjective sleep difficulty but not extreme impairment. Overall, self-report paints a picture of notable anxiety proneness alongside several protective psychosocial features (higher happiness, higher self-esteem, lower perceived stress) that would be expected to moderate depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and lifestyle indices show limited engagement in some activities associated with lower mood risk and better well-being. The participant reports minimal recreational drug and alcohol use, limited exercise (especially with others), and relatively low time spent socializing or engaging in sedentary leisure compared with peers. Low frequency of social exercise and group sports (z-scores strongly negative) modestly align with increased risk in some datasets (exercise-with-others correlation with CES-D ≈ -0.23), but the absolute levels here are low rather than suggestive of withdrawal or isolation severe enough on their own to indicate high depressive burden. Academic functioning is strong (high GPAs), interpersonal trust is above average (z = 0.83), and time spent reading is higher than peers (z = 1.30); these are behavioral markers more consistent with preserved functioning and engagement rather than marked anhedonia or social disengagement.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics show a mix of subtle risk and resilience signals. The participant’s resting heart rate (68.7 bpm, z = 1.25) and MESOR (83.16, z = 1.26) are elevated relative to the study sample; both have small positive correlations with CES-D (≈ 0.19), which suggests a modest association between higher basal cardiovascular tone and depressive symptoms in the cohort but does not by itself indicate high symptomatology. Circadian rhythm amplitude is reduced (amplitude z = -0.99), a pattern that has modest negative correlation with CES-D (corr ≈ -0.10) and can reflect lower physiological day–night differentiation; however, interdaily stability is above average (z = 0.67) and intradaily variability is lower than average (z = -0.39), indicating relatively consistent day-to-day rhythm and low fragmentation. Sleep from the wearable shows somewhat shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 32 min, z = -0.8) and notably high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 166 minutes, z = 1.49); sleep variability here correlates positively with CES-D (≈ 0.19), representing a measurable physiological risk factor. The median sleep start time is late (~1:19 AM), which, combined with high sleep variability, may contribute to mood vulnerability, but mean nap frequency is zero, and there is a clear morning heart-rate peak (large deviation at 8–9 AM) consistent with preserved daytime activation.

Integrative interpretation and likelihood relative to the sample distribution: multiple, competing signals exist. The strongest single indicator favoring elevated depressive symptom burden is trait anxiety (STAI) with a very high correlation to CES-D in this dataset. Physiological markers (elevated resting HR/MESOR and reduced amplitude) and high sleep-duration variability also weakly favor higher CES-D. Counterbalancing these risk signals are robust protective features: above-average self-reported happiness, lower perceived stress, relatively high self-esteem, strong academic functioning, high interpersonal trust, minimal substance use, and objective circadian regularity (higher interdaily stability and lower intradaily variability). Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests that while this participant shows some risk features—most notably anxiety proneness and inconsistent sleep—the overall profile leans toward lower-to-moderate depressive symptom burden within the sample. On net, the combination of protective psychosocial functioning and only modest physiological/behavioral risk indicators makes it more likely that the participant’s CES-D score would fall in the lower half of the study population distribution.

88882,2.0,0.06994818652849741,"Self-report measures show multiple indices consistent with relatively low depressive symptomatology. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 28; Z = -1.31) and elevated momentary positive affect (self-rated ""Happy"" = 5.0; Z = 1.64). Self-esteem is markedly high relative to the sample (RSES Z = 1.1) and perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.98). Academic functioning and health satisfaction are also favorable (high recent GPAs and health satisfaction Z = 0.55). Correlational benchmarks provided in the dataset indicate strong negative associations between self-esteem and CES-D (r ≈ -0.71) and a strong positive association for trait anxiety with CES-D (r ≈ 0.81); the participant’s low anxiety and high self-esteem therefore point toward lower CES-D scores.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators further align with a lower depressive symptom burden. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07) and limited recreational drug use, with only moderate alcohol consumption. Social and recreational patterns show lower time spent in passive sedentary pastimes (very little TV, no video games) and moderate social interaction. These activity patterns—especially frequent exercise and low substance/recreational-drug use—are generally protective factors relative to depressive symptom risk (correlations with CES-D in the dataset are small to modest in expected directions).

Objective sleep and circadian/wearable physiology present a mixed picture. Fitbit-derived sleep shows a short median nightly sleep duration (~5 h 57 min; Z = -1.53) and a late median sleep start time (~02:34), though night-to-night variability in sleep timing is relatively low (sleep start SD Z = -0.95). The PSQI score of 6 indicates some subjective sleep disturbance (just above common clinical cutoff), but PSQI Z = -0.33 suggests the participant is slightly better than the sample mean on subjective sleep overall. Short and late sleep could represent a behavioral risk factor for mood symptoms, but in this case subjective reports of happiness, low stress, and strong self-esteem do not reflect an elevated symptom signal.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics reflect physical fitness and a somewhat disrupted 24-hour structure. Resting heart rate is low (47.35 bpm; Z = -1.28), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Cosinor-derived mesor is lower than sample mean (Z = -1.22) and amplitude is near average. Non-parametric circadian measures show lower interdaily stability (Z = -0.57) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.6), indicating less regular day-to-day heart rate patterns and somewhat greater fragmentation of physiological activity. Hourly aggregated deviations from mesor show an unexpected high positive deviation at 1–2 AM (Z = 3.1), with other late-evening hours also elevated relative to mesor; this could reflect late-night arousal or episodic awakenings around an otherwise late bedtime. Correlations between these wearable-derived features and CES-D in the sample are generally small, so their contribution to estimating depressive symptoms is limited relative to the stronger self-report indicators.

Integrative interpretation: the preponderance of evidence supports relatively low depressive symptom burden. Strong protective signals include low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated reported happiness, frequent exercise, high academic performance, and low substance/recreational-drug use. Objective markers of fitness (low resting HR) and consistent sleep timing mitigate some concern, although short sleep duration and late bedtimes are notable behavioral risk features. Wearable circadian metrics indicate modest fragmentation but do not show strong sample-level associations with CES-D. Considering the relative weight of measures that most strongly correlate with depressive symptoms (e.g., STAI and self-esteem) and the consistency of positive psychosocial indicators, the balance of evidence indicates the participant’s CES-D score is likely in the lower half of the study distribution.

19245,26.0,0.844559585492228,"The self-report data indicate a cluster of affective and trait risk markers that are frequently associated with elevated depressive symptom burden. The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z = 1.35) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 27; Z = 1.47). Self-esteem is modestly below the sample mean (RSES = 35; Z = -0.45), and current self-reported happiness is comparatively low (score = 2.0; Z = -1.61). Interpersonal trust is particularly low relative to the sample (Z = -2.07). Several of these self-report indices have moderate-to-strong population correlations with CES-D in the dataset (for example STAI r ≈ 0.81, Self-Esteem r ≈ -0.71, Happiness r ≈ -0.46), which points toward an affective profile that commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptom scores.

Objective and circadian physiological measures from the wearable indicate a late and variable sleep–wake pattern with attenuated day-to-day regularity. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 hr 6 min; Z = 1.14) but sleep timing is pronouncedly delayed (median sleep start ≈ 02:38) with large night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 125 min; Z ≈ 0.92) and a high rate of napping (mean naps/day = 0.27; Z = 2.27). Circadian rhythm summary metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.31; Z = -0.82) and a modestly low amplitude and mesor of the heart-rate rhythm (Mesor ≈ 66.4 bpm, Z ≈ -1.03; Amplitude ≈ 10.1, Z ≈ -0.23). The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show elevated relative heart rate across late-evening to midnight hours (notably 10–11 pm and 11–12 am with Z-scores 2.25 and 1.98) and large negative deviations across typical early-morning hours, consistent with late-night activity and physiologic evening arousal. Together these features indicate circadian phase delay and reduced regularity rather than a stable, morning-oriented pattern.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators present a mixed picture with both adaptive and risk-relevant features. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.07) and moderate social time with friends (2–3 hours/day; Z ≈ 0.95), both of which can be protective for mood. Alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.01) and occasional recreational drug use (infrequent; Z ≈ 1.61) are present but not extreme. BMI is in the overweight range (≈ 29.2), and general satisfaction with physical health is below average (Z ≈ -0.78). Wearable-derived resting heart rate is relatively low (≈ 49.6 bpm; Z ≈ -1.02), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness, which may confer resilience against mood symptoms. However, the combination of late/variable sleep timing, frequent napping, and elevated evening physiological arousal are behavioral patterns often linked with poorer mood and greater depressive symptoms.

Integrating self-report and wearable-derived information yields convergent indicators pointing toward elevated depressive symptom risk within the study population. The strongest single signals are high trait anxiety and perceived stress, low happiness and trust, and disrupted/irregular sleep timing — features that, in this sample, correlate meaningfully with CES-D scores. Several wearable circadian metrics (low interdaily stability, delayed sleep onset, high nap frequency, and elevated late-evening heart rate deviations) align with the self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) and with patterns that have modest associations with higher CES-D in the study. Offsetting factors (regular exercise, social time, low resting heart rate) may attenuate risk but do not fully counterbalance the constellation of affective symptoms and sleep/circadian disruption.

Weighing the evidence holistically — particularly the high trait anxiety and perceived stress, low happiness and trust, disturbed subjective sleep, delayed and irregular sleep–wake timing, and circadian irregularity — the balance of indicators suggests this participant’s CES-D score is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively elevated symptom burden).

83748,9.0,0.39378238341968913,"Self-report trait and symptom measures indicate a profile that is broadly inconsistent with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant reports very low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71), high self-regard (SelfEsteem Z = +1.52), and relatively high momentary happiness (Happy Z = +1.64). Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS score = 19, Z = -0.71) and overall health satisfaction is above average (Z = +0.72). Each of these self-report indicators has an expected direction of association with CES‑D in the study (e.g., STAI correlates +0.82 with CES‑D; self‑esteem correlates −0.71), and the participant’s scores on these measures point toward a lower CES‑D burden rather than a higher one.

Behavioral lifestyle data reinforce the inference of lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others, and sports, all “three times a week or more”; Z-scores all > +1 for exercise measures) and minimal substance use. These activity patterns typically associate with lower CES‑D in the sample (exercise correlations to CES‑D are small-to-moderate and negative). Sedentary recreational time is minimal. One notable exception in the self-report domain is very low time spent socializing with friends (15 minutes or less; Z = -2.20). In this dataset that particular socializing metric shows negligible correlation with CES‑D (corr ≈ -0.02), so while it could be behaviorally relevant, it does not strongly signal higher depressive symptom levels in the study’s observed associations.

Wearable-derived physiological and sleep data show a generally regular and physiologically fit profile with one modest area of concern. Cardiovascular circadian metrics show a modestly lower mesor (69.4, Z = -0.62) and a relatively low resting heart rate (55.3, Z = -0.34), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness; amplitude and nonparametric rhythm measures are near the sample mean (Amplitude Z = -0.17; interdaily stability Z = -0.33; intradaily variability Z = +0.10). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected overnight troughs and pronounced evening/activity-period peaks (largest positive deviations in the early evening and late-night hours), which plausibly reflect evening activity or exertion rather than dysregulated arousal. Correlations between these specific wearable features and CES‑D are small in magnitude in the sample, so they provide little evidence for elevated depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is mildly disturbed (PSQI = 6, classification “Disturbed Sleep”), and median sleep duration is slightly below average at about 6 h 54 min (Z = -0.35). Sleep onset is fairly consistent (sleep start SD Z = -0.93) and naps are essentially absent. Taken together, sleep data suggest a modest sleep disturbance but not a pervasive pattern of highly irregular sleep or substantial sleep variability that, in this dataset, would strongly indicate higher CES‑D.

Weighing all modalities together, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden: very low trait anxiety (a measure that correlates strongly with CES‑D), elevated self‑esteem and happiness (both inversely related to CES‑D), frequent exercise, low substance use, and physiological indicators of fitness (lower resting HR). The primary countervailing findings are a PSQI score just above the common cutoff for disturbed sleep and unusually low reported socializing; neither of these in the current dataset exerts a strong association with higher CES‑D compared with the robust inverse signals from anxiety, self‑esteem, and happiness. Overall, the multimodal evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for CES‑D scores.

63347,14.0,0.6191709844559585,"Self-report profile: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45; Z = 0.37; labeled “anxious”), a characteristic strongly correlated with depressive symptom severity in this sample (STAI–CES-D correlation = 0.81). At the same time, the participant scores at the high end of self-esteem (RSES = 40; Z = 0.26), a variable that is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D in the study (correlation = -0.71). Current self-reported happiness is above sample average (Happy = 4; Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is near or slightly below the sample mean (PSS = 21; Z = -0.17), with stress showing a modest positive association with CES-D (correlation = 0.28). Subjective sleep quality is worse than typical (PSQI = 7; classified as disturbed sleep), which is a risk-relevant feature though its sample Z-score is near the mean (Z = 0.13). Health satisfaction is below average (Z = -0.78), and the participant reports minimal substance use and little engagement in exercise or organized sport (large negative Z-scores for exercising alone and with others), factors that can be relevant to mood but have relatively modest CES-D correlations in this dataset.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian behavior: Fitbit-derived circadian metrics indicate a well-structured and relatively high-amplitude cardiac rhythm across the recording period. Interdaily stability (0.48; Z = 0.58) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.44; Z = 0.98) are above average, intradaily variability is lower than typical (0.35; Z = -1.38), and cosinor amplitude is relatively large (Amplitude = 16.02; Z = 1.69). These rhythm metrics collectively point to regular, consolidated daily cardiovascular patterns. Resting heart rate is low-normal (56.9 bpm; Z = -0.15). Hourly mean heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and evening peaks (largest positive deviations around 7–8 PM), consistent with preserved diurnal physiology. Objective sleep features include a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 h 49 min (Z = -0.46), a late median sleep onset time (~01:28), and a comparatively large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 151 minutes; Z = 1.14). These wearable-derived sleep findings align with the survey PSQI indicating disturbed sleep, but the circadian regularity and low intradaily fragmentation argue against extreme dysregulation of daily behavioral rhythms.

Integration and interpretation relative to CES-D distribution: The available indicators present a mixed pattern with some risk-relevant signals (elevated trait anxiety; disturbed subjective sleep; late, variable sleep timing; minimal exercise/social recreation) and several protective or neutral signals (very high self-esteem, above-average reported happiness, low resting heart rate, strong and regular circadian rhythms, minimal substance use, and high academic performance). In terms of predictive weight within this dataset, trait anxiety has a strong positive correlation with CES-D while self-esteem and happiness have substantial inverse correlations; here those opposing predictors are both present in meaningful magnitudes. Overall, the balance of evidence favors relatively lower-to-moderate depressive symptom burden rather than markedly elevated burden: high self-esteem and current happiness, together with preserved physiological rhythm regularity and low resting heart rate, are robust counter-indicators to the modestly elevated trait anxiety and sleep disturbance. Considering the mix of signals and their magnitudes, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the CES-D distribution (i.e., not in the top 50% for depressive symptom severity) in this sample.
