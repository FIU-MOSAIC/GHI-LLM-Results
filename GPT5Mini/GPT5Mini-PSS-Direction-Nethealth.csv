44869,2.0,"Multimodal psychological profile and self-report changes:
Self-report instruments show a mixed pattern. Depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D decreased markedly (22 → 6), shifting the participant from a higher symptom classification to a low-symptom profile, and trait anxiety (STAI) decreased slightly. Self-esteem declined modestly (40 → 37), and interpersonal trust fell marginally; self-reported happiness was unchanged and health satisfaction edged upward. These changes suggest an improvement in reported depressive symptom burden and modest reductions in trait anxiety, while self-evaluative and social-trust measures worsened slightly.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep experience:
Objective and subjective sleep measures diverge in important ways. Median nightly sleep duration decreased by ~54 minutes (8h26m → 7h31m), and median sleep start time shifted substantially later (≈01:00 → ≈02:33), while night-to-night variability in both start time and duration decreased (more consistent but later and shorter sleep). Sleep latency increased markedly (20 → 60 minutes), indicating more difficulty initiating sleep despite slightly greater consistency in timing. The participant’s perceived control over sleep duration was unchanged. Overall, the sleep pattern has shifted later and shorter with increased time to fall asleep.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian rhythm:
Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a loss of robust daily rhythmicity and a shift in timing. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation both decreased substantially, amplitude of the circadian rhythm declined, and the acrophase shifted later (previous mid/late-afternoon peak → evening ~7:50 PM). Mesor increased slightly and resting heart rate rose (~76.4 → 77.9 bpm; elevated relative to the study sample), while aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show relatively higher cardiac activity into the late evening and nocturnal hours compared with the previous wave. Together these changes reflect a delayed and blunted circadian pattern with higher baseline cardiovascular activation, particularly in the evening.

Behavioral activity and lifestyle:
Physical activity/exercise frequency declined to none from occasional activity. Sedentary leisure (internet use, music listening, sedentary hobby) increased, and the participant added regular video game time. Alcohol use increased slightly (beginning occasional wine/liquor). Socializing time was unchanged. The pattern is one of reduced physical activity and increased sedentary, screen-based behaviors.

Integrative interpretation with respect to perceived stress:
Physiological and behavioral indicators (increased sleep latency, later and shorter sleep, weakened interdaily stability and circadian amplitude, later acrophase, higher resting heart rate, and reduced exercise with greater sedentary time) collectively point toward increased physiological arousal and circadian disruption—patterns commonly associated with higher perceived stress. In contrast, self-report symptom measures show a large decline in depressive symptoms and a small reduction in trait anxiety, which would typically align with reduced perceived stress. The small declines in self-esteem and interpersonal trust may reflect social or self-evaluative strains that could increase perceived stress. Given the magnitude and coherence of objective physiological and behavioral deterioration (sleep initiation problems, circadian phase delay, elevated resting HR, loss of day-to-day rhythmicity, and markedly reduced exercise), these objective signals provide stronger directional information about acute stress-related physiological load than the single large improvement in depressive-symptom reporting. On balance, the multimodal evidence is more consistent with an increase in physiological and behavioral correlates of perceived stress despite improvement in depressive symptom scores.

92552,1.0,"Psychological self-report signals a marked worsening of affective state across waves. The CES-D increased dramatically (15 → 46), and STAI trait anxiety rose substantially (45 → 60), both changes large in magnitude and consistent with increased negative affect and anxiety proneness. Concurrently, trait self-esteem declined sharply (44 → 26) and a single-item happiness rating fell (4 → 1). Health satisfaction also decreased. Together these large, directionally-consistent changes in mood, anxiety, self-worth, and perceived health indicate a pronounced deterioration in subjective emotional functioning that would be expected to accompany higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators show mixed but mostly stress-consistent shifts. The participant reports markedly reduced alcohol use (from weekly use to none) and reduced socializing time; exercise patterns shifted toward more sport activity but less frequent solo and group exercise overall, while sedentary hobby time increased. Body mass index rose substantially (23.29 → 27.45). Reduced social engagement, increased sedentary time, and weight gain alongside fewer reported coping behaviors (less socializing) are behavioral patterns that commonly accompany greater perceived stress or distress, even though the cessation of alcohol use could be neutral or adaptive depending on context.

Sleep metrics indicate worsening sleep quality and greater irregularity. Self-reported sleep latency increased from ~30 to 100 minutes, and objective median nightly sleep decreased from ~7h49m to ~6h27m. Objective sleep start times shifted earlier by about 1h15m but became much more variable (sleep start SD increased markedly). Sleep duration variability also increased. This pattern — longer sleep latency, shorter median sleep on the device, and increased night-to-night variability — aligns with sleep disruption and fragmentation that typically co-occur with elevated stress and mood disturbance.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian measures suggest increased tonic and daytime physiological activation and reduced day-to-day regularity. Resting heart rate and the cosinor mesor both increased (resting HR ~49 → 55.9 bpm; mesor +8.9), and daytime hourly heart-rate values show larger afternoon peaks in the current aggregated profile (notably very high values in the 2–4 pm window). Amplitude increased and acrophase shifted earlier, indicating a stronger but phase-advanced rhythm, while interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation declined, signaling reduced regularity across days. Intradaily variability decreased (less fragmentation within days), but the overall pattern—higher baseline cardiac tone and larger daytime peaks together with less stable day-to-day rhythms—points to greater physiological arousal and disrupted circadian regularity, both consistent with elevated stress burden.

Integrative assessment and direction of change for perceived stress: multiple independent streams converge toward greater distress and physiological arousal. Large increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, steep declines in self-esteem and happiness, objective signs of sleep disruption (longer latency, shorter median sleep, higher variability), increases in resting and daytime heart rate, and behavioral changes (less socializing, more sedentary time, weight gain) together form a coherent picture that aligns with an increase in perceived stress since the prior wave. Some isolated changes—reduced alcohol use and increased sport frequency—could be adaptive, but they do not outweigh the magnitude and consistency of worsening mood, sleep, and physiological arousal. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress has increased.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
73158,-6.0,"Self-report measures show small but consistent shifts in affective indicators. Scores on the CES-D and trait STAI both rose by a single point relative to the prior wave, although both remain at very low absolute levels and within the ""not depressed""/""not anxious"" range. Self-esteem fell modestly (−1 point) from an elevated baseline, while self-reported happiness remained high and unchanged. Interpersonal trust increased moderately. These patterns indicate minor deterioration on some negative affect and self-evaluation indices (small increases in depressive/anxious symptom scores and a small drop in self-esteem) coexisting with stable-to-improved social-affective indicators (unchanged high happiness and a rise in reported trust). Correlations linking these small score changes to PSS change are minimal in magnitude, so each shift should be interpreted as low-to-moderate evidence rather than strong proof of PSS change.

Lifestyle and activity behaviors present a mixed picture. The participant reports an increase in exercise frequency when exercising alone (from monthly to weekly) and consistently high frequency of exercising with others, indicating greater overall activity engagement. Substance use remains absent. Sedentary/leisure habits shifted modestly (less TV time, slightly more video game time). Academic performance and health satisfaction are unchanged, while BMI increased slightly (0.68). Increased physical activity would typically be expected to buffer perceived stress, whereas the small BMI increase and modest changes in leisure patterns are unlikely to drive large shifts in stress on their own.

Sleep data show divergent signals between quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep duration increased from about 6h11m to 6h47m (a moderate gain), and subjective weekday sleep duration rose by 30 minutes. However, measures of sleep consistency show marked deterioration: standard deviation of sleep duration rose substantially (from 105 to 138 minutes) and sleep start time variability more than doubled (SD increase of ~72 minutes). Sleep latency increased slightly (5 to 10 minutes). Increased total sleep time alongside substantially greater night-to-night variability and more irregular sleep timing suggests improved quantity but worse regularity; sleep irregularity is independently associated with poorer stress regulation and may be more consequential for perceived stress than the modest increase in average duration.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics corroborate a decrease in rhythm regularity alongside mixed changes in basal physiology. Interdaily stability declined (0.53 → 0.42) while intradaily variability rose slightly, and 24-hour autocorrelation fell — all indicating that day-to-day structure in heart-rate patterns weakened. MESOR (mean circadian heart-rate) decreased slightly while amplitude increased; resting heart rate rose by 0.9 bpm but remains low in absolute terms (48.5 bpm, well below population mean). Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show lower values at many daytime hours compared with the prior wave, but there are some shifts in midday peaks. Overall, the circadian heart-rate profile is less stable and more fragmented than previously, a pattern that is plausibly linked to greater physiological stress vulnerability even though mean heart-rate indices remain within a fit range. Correlations of these wearable deltas with PSS change are small, so these signals provide modest evidence toward change in perceived stress rather than definitive proof.

Holistic synthesis and directional assessment: the multimodal data present competing influences. Protective signals include increased exercise frequency, a modest increase in total sleep duration, stable high happiness and increased interpersonal trust, and low absolute levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Adverse signals include marked increases in sleep timing and duration variability, decreased interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability in heart-rate circadian metrics, small rises in depressive/anxiety scores and a small drop in self-esteem, and a small BMI increase. The participant’s initial PSS was below average, and the dataset reports a negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change (higher initial PSS linked to later decreases), which statistically implies participants with a relatively low initial PSS (as here) are more likely to show increases. Taken together, the balance of evidence — particularly the substantial worsening of sleep regularity and circadian stability alongside small adverse shifts in affective self-report — points toward a modest increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave. Uncertainty remains because several salutary changes (exercise, greater sleep quantity, stable happiness) countervail this trend, but overall the pattern supports a net increase in perceived stress.

22138,-5.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological measures and mood: The strongest signals in the survey data indicate improvement in internalizing symptoms between waves. The CES-D score fell markedly from 15 to 5 (delta -10), and the STAI–Trait score declined from 50 to 41 (delta -9); both changes are sizable and point to reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Health satisfaction rose (3.44 → 4.33), and self-reported happiness was unchanged. Self-esteem decreased modestly (42 → 38), and interpersonal trust declined (2.83 → 2.33). The direction and magnitude of the CES-D and STAI changes are the most salient psychological signals and, given their positive correlations with PSS change in the dataset, would be expected to accompany a reduction in perceived stress. The modest drop in self-esteem and the larger drop in trust are countervailing influences but are smaller in magnitude than the improvements on depression/anxiety indices.

Paragraph 2 — Behavior and lifestyle changes: Daily activities shifted in mixed ways. The participant increased time on video games substantially and reduced internet browsing time; socializing and reading both increased modestly. Exercise with others decreased by one frequency unit (e.g., from ≥3×/week to 1–2×/week) and exercising alone remained nil. Alcohol use patterns were stable. In aggregate, social engagement and recreational reading increased (generally protective for well-being), while organized/partnered exercise decreased and gaming increased (potentially compensatory or avoidance-oriented). These behavioral shifts are mixed but lean toward improved social and leisure engagement despite reduced group exercise.

Paragraph 3 — Subjective and wearable sleep: Sleep shows modest improvement and greater regularity. Self-reported normal weekday sleep duration increased by about one hour and median Fitbit sleep duration rose by ~14 minutes (to a median 7 h 46 min). Night-to-night variability decreased substantially (sleep duration SD down from 82 to 54 minutes), and sleep start times shifted later (median start ~1:15 AM → 2:06 AM) while becoming more consistent (start time SD decreased by ~55 minutes). Sleep latency doubled from 10 to 20 minutes but remains within a commonly acceptable range. Overall the pattern is increased total sleep and greater consistency, which typically aligns with reduced perceived stress and better recovery.

Paragraph 4 — Circadian and cardiovascular physiology: Circadian rhythm summaries show a modest reorganization: MESOR (average heart rate) increased slightly (+2.5), amplitude of the 24-hour rhythm decreased (-2.37), and acrophase shifted later by roughly an hour, consistent with the later habitual sleep times. Interdaily stability fell minimally while autocorrelation at 24 hours increased, indicating mixed changes in day-to-day rhythm regularity with a slightly stronger 24-hour autocorrelation but lower overall stability. Resting heart rate increased by ~1.9 bpm. Hourly mean heart rates are elevated across many daytime/evening hours compared with the prior period, producing a modest upward shift in cardiovascular tone. These physiological changes (small RHR increase, lower amplitude) could reflect greater sympathetic tone or lifestyle shifts (later schedule, changed activity patterns); their magnitudes are moderate and not as large as the psychological improvements observed.

Paragraph 5 — Integrated interpretation and implications for perceived stress (PSS): The largest and most consistent signals favor reduced perceived stress: large decreases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, increased health satisfaction, longer and more regular sleep, and increased social/leisure engagement. The initial PSS was relatively elevated (24.0) and the dataset reports a negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change, which is consistent with larger improvements among those starting higher. Countervailing signals include a small rise in resting heart rate and MESOR, reduced circadian amplitude, loss of interpersonal trust, decreased group exercise, and increased gaming; these suggest some physiological arousal and shifts in coping/behavior that could attenuate improvement for some stress domains. On balance, the magnitude and direction of the psychological symptom improvements (CES-D, STAI) together with sleep stabilization and higher health satisfaction provide stronger evidence for a net decrease in perceived stress than for an increase.

31439,-3.0,"Psychological self-report measures show several notable changes that point toward reduced affective symptom burden. The CES-D score fell by 4 points (16 → 12), moving the participant from the “depressed” classification to “not depressed,” and the STAI–Trait score declined by 4 points (49 → 45) though it remains elevated relative to the sample mean. Self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust both increased modestly. These mood- and anxiety-related changes have positive delta correlations with PSS change (CES-D Δ correlation = 0.26; STAI Δ correlation = 0.19), meaning the observed reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms are the kind of changes that tend to accompany reductions in perceived stress. Counterbalancing these improvements is a large drop in global self-esteem (Rosenberg score decreased by 9 points), which is a substantive negative shift in self-appraisal that could act to maintain or raise perceived stress; however, the correlation of self-esteem change with PSS change is small in magnitude.

Behavioral and lifestyle data present a mixed pattern. The participant reports substantially less exercise (both alone and with others declined from roughly weekly to less than monthly), increased time spent on internet use, and greater engagement in a sedentary hobby; socializing time remained stable. Self-reported sleep also worsened subjectively: sleep latency increased by 20 minutes and reported normal weekday sleep decreased by one hour. By contrast, objective wearable sleep metrics show a modest increase in median sleep duration (+23 minutes) but increased night-to-night variability and a later median sleep start time (~30 minutes later). The subjective worsening of sleep latency and decreased weekday sleep duration has a small negative delta correlation with PSS change (i.e., these changes are of the type that could be associated with increased stress), whereas the small objective increase in median sleep duration has negligible correlation with PSS change. Overall, the reduction in physical activity and increase in sleep timing variability are potential contributors to sustained or increased stress, but several of these changes have weak correlations with PSS change.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics suggest altered daily organization with modest signs of greater fragmentation but lower daytime cardiovascular peaks. Circadian parametrics show a slight reduction in MESOR and a small increase in amplitude; non-parametric metrics indicate a small drop in interdaily stability and an increase in intradaily variability (IV), the latter reflecting more fragmented within-day rhythmicity. Resting heart rate remains elevated relative to the study population but decreased slightly from the prior wave; aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower peak values in several daytime hours compared with the previous period. The increase in intradaily variability is positively correlated with PSS change (IV Δ correlation = 0.10), so greater fragmentation would be expected to associate with increased perceived stress, whereas the modest reductions in some daytime heart-rate peaks and in resting HR align with decreased physiological arousal and could correspond with lower perceived stress. These physiological signals are mixed but small in magnitude.

Synthesizing across modalities, affective self-report improvements (notably decreased depressive symptoms and reduced trait anxiety, plus increased happiness and trust) constitute the strongest and most consistent signal pointing toward reduced perceived stress. Several behavioral and physiological indices provide countervailing evidence (large decline in self-esteem, marked reduction in exercise, increased circadian fragmentation, and subjective reports of worse sleep latency and less weekday sleep), but the effect sizes and the delta–PSS correlations for these countervailing measures are generally smaller or mixed. Given the pattern of sizable mood/anxiety improvements that are positively associated with PSS change and the relatively weaker, mixed signals from lifestyle and physiological data, the overall balance of evidence indicates that the participant’s perceived stress is more likely to have decreased or remained stable rather than worsened.

46558,-7.0,"Summary of multimodal change:
Across self-report and wearable domains the participant shows a mixed pattern of behavioral and physiological change, with several signals pointing toward worsening perceived well-being alongside a few indicators of improved physiological regulation. Subjective mood and self-concept measures shifted notably in a negative direction: self-reported happiness decreased by 2 points (from 5 to 3, a large relative drop, Z-score of the change ≈ -1.8) and self‑esteem declined by 4 points (Z-change ≈ -0.72). Trait anxiety rose slightly (STAI +2 points), while depressive symptom score (CES‑D) remained stable at 17. Daily social engagement decreased modestly (socializing −1 hour), while solitary leisure (listening to music) increased (+2 hours). Alcohol use (beer) increased in frequency from monthly to weekly. These subjective and behavioral shifts—especially the large decreases in happiness and self-esteem and reduced social time—are commonly associated with increased perceived stress or a worsening subjective stress profile.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian patterns:
Fitbit-derived sleep shows only a small reduction in median nightly sleep duration (≈8 minutes shorter) but a meaningful delay and destabilization of sleep timing: median sleep start shifted later by ~31 minutes and night‑to‑night start-time variability increased by about 30 minutes. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced regularity: interdaily stability decreased (−0.07) and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined, while intradaily variability increased slightly. The cosinor acrophase shifted about one hour later (5:09 PM → 6:09 PM), consistent with a phase delay. Taken together, these wearable findings indicate a modest decline in the stability and timing of daily physiological rhythms, which is often linked to greater perceived stress and poorer mood even when total sleep time changes little.

Cardiovascular / physiological signals:
Resting heart rate decreased by ~2.7 bpm (61.6 → 58.9), a change that by itself typically reflects improved cardiovascular recovery or fitness and could indicate reduced tonic sympathetic arousal. Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show a relative lowering in some daytime hours but higher mean heart rates in late evening hours (notably an increase around 8–11 PM compared with the prior period). The amplitude and mesor of the circadian fit are essentially stable. Thus physiological arousal signals are mixed: a lower resting heart rate suggests reduced baseline physiological strain, while the later-evening elevations and reduced circadian regularity point toward increased evening arousal and circadian disruption.

Behavioral activity and lifestyle:
The participant reports modest increases in physical activity participation (exercising alone/with others and sports increased from near-zero to low but positive frequencies), which could support stress resilience. However, socializing decreased and substance use (beer) increased in frequency. Sedentary recreational patterns remain relatively high (TV, video games), although time on video games decreased slightly. Health satisfaction rose modestly. Overall, lifestyle changes are heterogeneous: some health-promoting behaviors increased (exercise, lower resting HR), while social engagement fell and alcohol use rose.

Integration and inference about perceived stress direction:
Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most salient indicators of worsening subjective state are the large declines in happiness and self-esteem, and reduced social engagement—changes that are closely tied to perceived stress and emotional burden. Circadian destabilization and later sleep timing further support the interpretation of increased psychosocial strain, particularly because these changes were more pronounced than the very small drop in sleep duration. Countervailing evidence includes a reduced resting heart rate and small increases in exercise frequency and health satisfaction, which could reflect improved physiological fitness or compensatory health behaviors. However, these physiological/behavioral improvements appear smaller in magnitude and less directly tied to subjective distress than the pronounced negative shifts in mood and self-concept. On balance, the multimodal pattern (marked decreases in happiness and self-esteem, increased evening arousal and circadian irregularity, reduced social time, and increased alcohol frequency) is more consistent with an overall increase in perceived stress since the prior wave.

93699,5.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological and affective change:
Relative to the prior wave, self-reported affect and trait measures show a mixed pattern. Trait anxiety (STAI) is slightly lower (44 → 42), and self-esteem is unchanged, while depressive symptoms on the CES-D rose modestly (8 → 11) but remain below clinical thresholds. General happiness and interpersonal trust are unchanged at relatively lower-than-average levels. Notable positive change is a marked increase in self-rated health satisfaction (2.78 → 4.33), and BMI declined (28.69 → 26.21), which may reflect improvements in perceived physical health. Taken together, subjective psychological indicators do not show a clear large shift in one direction: anxiety edged down slightly, depressive symptoms increased modestly, and global satisfaction with health improved substantially.

Paragraph 2 — Behavioral and lifestyle changes:
Behavioral habits are likewise mixed. Daily recreation patterns and heavy internet use remain unchanged and above the population mean (internet >4 hours). Socializing time is stable. Exercise done alone decreased in frequency, while exercising with others remained stable and participation in sports increased from none to occasional — a small net increase in structured physical activity but less solitary exercise. Alcohol use shows a small increase in wine/liquor frequency. The participant also reports less perceived control over sleep duration (from “Agree” to “Somewhat agree”), and their ideal weekday sleep declined (desire shortened from 8 to 7 hours), even though reported weekday sleep duration remained steady at about 6 hours. These behavioral shifts suggest some changes in routines (less solitary exercise, persistent high internet use, lower subjective sleep control) that could influence stress regulation.

Paragraph 3 — Sleep/wearable sleep metrics:
Objective sleep from the wearable is largely stable. Median nightly sleep duration is essentially unchanged and near 6 hours 54 minutes, sleep timing moved earlier by about 28 minutes, and night-to-night variability in duration and start time decreased slightly. These patterns indicate modest gains in regularity and an earlier median sleep onset, but absolute sleep duration remains short relative to typical recommendations and the participant reports reduced control over sleep length. Stability and slightly earlier timing could be protective for stress, whereas persistently short sleep opportunity may limit recovery.

Paragraph 4 — Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Wearable-derived circadian features indicate more pronounced baseline cardiovascular activation. The MESOR (mean circadian heart rate) increased by ~4.9 bpm and resting heart rate rose by ~2.1 bpm; amplitude also increased modestly. Interdaily stability remained high and intradaily variability decreased (less within-day fragmentation), suggesting a more regular day-to-day rhythm but at a higher baseline heart-rate set point. Hourly aggregated heart rates show elevated daytime and evening values compared with the prior wave (notably mid-day and late-afternoon/evening hours), consistent with increased tonic physiological arousal across the day. This combination — greater regularity but a higher mean heart rate and elevated hourly rates — is most consistent with increased basal cardiovascular activation rather than improved autonomic downregulation.

Paragraph 5 — Integrative interpretation with respect to perceived stress:
Evidence for an increase in perceived stress: (a) objective physiology shows higher resting and mean heart rate and elevated hourly heart rates, which are reliable markers of increased sympathetic tone or sustained physiological load; (b) small rise in depressive symptom score and reduced perceived control over sleep could reflect greater subjective strain; and (c) reduced frequency of solitary exercise and persistent high internet time may reduce coping resources. Evidence for stability or improvement: (a) trait anxiety decreased slightly and self-rated health satisfaction improved substantially, and (b) sleep timing regularity improved and sleep variability decreased. Weighing these streams, the physiological indicators of increased tonic arousal (MESOR, resting HR, daytime HR elevations) are robust and often closely related to stress burden, and they are coupled with small adverse shifts in mood and perceived sleep control despite gains in health satisfaction. On balance the multimodal signal points to a modest worsening in stress-related physiological load with some compensatory subjective improvements; overall, the balance favors a small increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
84011,0.0,"Multimodal summary and context
Across the two measurement waves the participant’s profile shows a mixture of favorable changes in mood, sleep regulation, and physiology alongside a few indicators of potential risk (reduced self-reported happiness and increased alcohol use). Objective wearable data indicate a lower cardiovascular set point (lower MESOR and lower resting heart rate) and tighter sleep timing regularity; self-reported measures show reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety and small gains in self-esteem and perceived control over sleep. Taken together, these multimodal signals point more toward improved physiological regulation and some aspects of emotional functioning than toward a clear worsening of perceived stress, although not every indicator is uniformly positive.

Self-report psychological measures
On standardized self-report instruments the participant’s CES-D score fell (6 → 4) and STAI–Trait decreased (44 → 41), both shifts consistent with reduced depressive symptom burden and lower trait anxiety since the prior wave. Rosenberg self-esteem increased modestly (33 → 35), and trust and health satisfaction increased slightly. One countervailing self-report is the single-item happiness rating, which declined (4 → 3); this decrease may capture a change in momentary well-being not reflected in the trait measures. Overall, the dominant pattern in the validated trait scales is toward modest improvement in affective symptoms and self-regard, which—based on the reported delta correlations for STAI and CES-D—would be expected to accompany stable or lower perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian/physiological patterns
Objective sleep and circadian metrics show improved regularity and largely preserved quantity. Median nightly sleep length decreased slightly (~22 minutes) but remains relatively long (~8 h 6 m), and night-to-night variability in sleep start time decreased substantially (start-time SD reduced from 82 to 48 minutes). The participant also reports shorter sleep latency (15 → 10 minutes) and a subjective increase in perceived control over sleep duration (from “Disagree” to “Somewhat Agree”), supporting better perceived sleep quality and routine. Heart-rate–derived circadian measures show a notable drop in MESOR (≈ -6.2 bpm) and a decline in resting heart rate (≈ -5.4 bpm), with amplitude essentially unchanged; these changes are consistent with a lower baseline cardiovascular activation across the recording period. Nonparametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability, intradaily variability, autocorrelation at 24 h) show small declines but little directional change overall. The aggregate pattern—improved sleep regularity and lower resting HR/MESOR—better aligns with reduced physiological stress or improved fitness/recovery rather than heightened chronic stress.

Activity, substance use, and daily routines
The participant reports continued high engagement in physical activity (sports and exercise with others remain frequent) and increased frequency of exercising alone; greater exercise consistency is typically associated with improved mood and lower perceived stress. Recreational drug use remains absent; however, alcohol use increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a week” for beer and modestly for wine. The beer-use change is a relatively large delta relative to the sample (large Z-Score of the change), although its reported delta correlation with PSS change is very small. Leisure patterns (limited TV/internet/video game use) are essentially unchanged. Taken together, the behavioral profile largely supports maintenance or improvement of stress-buffering behaviors (exercise, stable routines), with a notable increase in alcohol frequency that warrants monitoring but is not strongly tied by the provided correlations to worsening PSS in this dataset.

Evidence for worsening perceived stress
The clearest signals that could reflect increased perceived stress are the drop in single-item happiness and the increase in alcohol consumption; the happiness decrease had a modest negative delta correlation (suggesting changes in happiness relate to PSS change) and may indicate some decline in momentary well-being. Circadian nonparametric measures show slight declines in interdaily stability and autocorrelation which, on their own, could be interpreted as small reductions in day-to-day regularity (a potential stress-related pattern), but these changes are small in magnitude.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress
Stronger evidence points toward stability or improvement: reductions in CES-D and STAI scores, increases in self-esteem and perceived control over sleep, improved sleep-timing regularity, and a lower resting heart rate/MESOR are all consistent with reduced physiological arousal and improved affective functioning. Many of these measures have delta correlations that, when combined with their observed direction of change (e.g., anxiety and depressive symptom reductions), predict decreases in PSS or maintenance of lower stress. High and stable engagement in physical activity and improved sleep regularity are additional supportive factors for stable or lower perceived stress.

Holistic assessment and conclusion
Weighing the constellation of changes, the preponderance of evidence supports either stable or decreased perceived stress compared with the prior wave. Improvements in validated trait mood measures (CES-D, STAI), gains in self-esteem and sleep control, more regular sleep timing, and reductions in resting heart rate and MESOR are relatively robust and coherent indicators of reduced physiological and psychological strain. The principal adverse signals are a drop in a single-item happiness score and an increase in alcohol frequency; these are important to monitor but do not outweigh the multiple convergent markers of improvement. On balance, the data indicate that perceived stress has remained stable or declined since the previous assessment.

88008,0.0,"Summary of self-report psychological measures: Across survey waves the participant shows concurrent, substantive increases in symptom-report measures of negative affect alongside declines in protective self-appraisals. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) rose from 20 to 27 (Δ = +7), and trait anxiety (STAI) increased from 48 to 56 (Δ = +8). Self-esteem declined by 6 points (33 → 27). These changes are moderate-to-large in magnitude relative to the study population (notable positive Z-score shifts for CES-D and STAI; negative Z-score shift for self-esteem). Health satisfaction and interpersonal trust also decreased from previously higher values. The direction and size of these survey changes are commonly associated with increased subjective stress in the broader literature; the provided delta correlations for CES-D (0.25) and STAI (0.19) with PSS change are positive, supporting their relevance to increases in perceived stress, though these correlations are modest.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes: The participant reports increases in social activity (socializing time up by one category), sedentary hobby time (a large increase), reading and music-listening, and a modest initiation or increase in alcohol use (beer and wine moved from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month”). Exercise frequency largely held steady for solo exercise but the frequency of organized sports decreased by one category. The pattern suggests some increased social and leisure engagement but also greater sedentary recreation and small increases in alcohol use. These behavioral shifts are mixed in their likely effects on stress: increased socialization and leisure reading could be protective, whereas reduced sports frequency, increased sedentary time, and initiation of alcohol use are more consistent with coping responses to elevated stress or mood symptoms.

Sleep and circadian/physiological markers: Median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (≈18 minutes; from ~6h9m to ~6h27m) but remains below the participant’s stated ideal of 7 hours; subjective control over sleep duration is unchanged and rated low. Sleep timing became slightly earlier and more regular (median start ~12 minutes earlier; start-time SD decreased from 77 to 53 minutes), while night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased slightly. Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate reduced circadian amplitude (14.34 → 12.09) and a small decrease in mesor, together with increased intradaily variability (0.28 → 0.40) and a slight decline in interdaily stability. Resting heart rate rose modestly (54.0 → 55.3 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show attenuation of the previous daytime–evening peaks (reduced amplitude) and modest upward shifts in some afternoon/evening hours. Collectively these wearable signals point to a weakening and fragmentation of daily physiological rhythms and a small increase in baseline physiological arousal—patterns that are often observed in association with elevated perceived stress and mood symptom burden.

Integrated interpretation and weighing of evidence: The strongest, most consistent indicators across modalities point toward an increase in psychological distress and perceived stress. Large increases in depressive and anxiety symptom scores and the decline in self-esteem constitute direct, self-reported markers of worsening affective state. Circadian and autonomic measures (reduced amplitude, greater intradaily variability, slightly higher resting HR) provide objective, convergent evidence of greater physiological dysregulation and rhythm fragmentation. Behavioral markers are mixed but include potentially maladaptive changes (more sedentary recreation, reduced sports participation, modest uptake of alcohol use) that align with stress-related coping. A few signals (slightly longer median sleep and increased socializing/happiness rating) are temporally discordant and may reflect partial compensatory behaviors, but they do not offset the consistent pattern of worsening mood/anxiety symptoms and weakened physiological rhythms. Given the magnitude and consistency of the symptom increases and the objective circadian/physiological changes that typically accompany elevated stress, the preponderance of evidence supports an increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

83566,-6.0,"Self-report psychological symptom measures show large, directionally consistent improvements between waves. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D fell sharply (from 37 to 5 points, a 32-point reduction, Z-score delta ≈ -3.41), and trait anxiety on the STAI declined substantially (62 to 42 points, a 20-point reduction, Z-score delta ≈ -2.33). Self-esteem increased by 11 points to the scale maximum (29 to 40), and a single-item happiness rating rose modestly. These changes are large in magnitude and consistently favor reduced negative affect and greater perceived self-worth. Given the documented positive correlations between changes in affective symptoms and PSS change in the dataset (CES-D delta correlation 0.25, STAI delta correlation 0.18), the pattern of large decreases in depressive and anxious symptoms provides strong evidence consistent with a reduction in perceived stress.

Lifestyle and self-reported sleep habits show smaller or mixed changes that partially moderate the psychological picture. Self-reported normal weekday sleep duration increased modestly from 6.0 to 6.5 hours, while ideal sleep time remained at 8 hours and perceived control over sleep remained “somewhat disagree.” Alcohol and recreational drug use remain minimal; a minor increase in wine/liquor use (from “not at all” to “<1–2 times/month”) is present but small in absolute terms. Exercise behavior shifted away from solo exercise (now none) toward exercising with others (an increase from none to 1–2 times/month). These behavioral changes do not suggest a large new source of stress and, in some respects (increased social exercise, more sleep reported), align with the pattern of improved affect, though limited sleep control and slightly increased irregularity in sleep duration temper that interpretation.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological metrics are mixed but do not strongly contradict the psychological improvements. Circadian parametric features show modest decreases in mesor and amplitude (slightly lower average heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude) and a later acrophase (the heart rate peak shifted ~28 minutes later), while nonparametric markers show a small drop in interdaily stability and a small decrease in intradaily variability. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased, suggesting somewhat improved day-to-day rhythmic persistence despite a modest reduction in other regularity indices. Resting heart rate rose slightly (≈ +1.3 bpm) and the distribution of aggregated hourly heart rates shows some hours with higher mean values relative to the previous wave; however, the magnitude of these physiological shifts is small. Sleep objective metrics from the device show essentially stable median nightly sleep (8:08 → 8:01, a 7-minute change) with increased night-to-night variability (SD increased by ~25 minutes) and a slightly later median sleep start time (~18 minutes later). Overall, wearable data indicate only small physiological changes with mixed signs—slightly more variability in duration but modest improvements in some rhythm metrics—so they offer limited countervailing evidence to the large improvements in self-reported affect.

Weighing the evidence holistically: large, clinically meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety together with increases in self-esteem and happiness are primary indicators that perceived stress has decreased since the prior wave. Behavioral data (increased social exercise, stable/minimally improved sleep duration) are directionally consistent with lower stress, while wearable physiology presents small, mixed signals (slightly higher resting heart rate and greater night-to-night sleep variability, but improved 24-hour autocorrelation and reduced intradaily fragmentation). The correlations provided (including a moderately negative correlation between initial PSS and later change, r ≈ -0.56) further support the expectation that this participant’s PSS score would decline given the large improvements in affective measures. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports an overall decrease (improvement) in perceived stress.

94641,-7.0,"Psychological symptom scales show substantial improvement in core mood and anxiety indicators between waves. The CES-D score fell markedly from 29 to 11 (Δ = -18, Z-Score of Δ = -1.86), moving the participant from a previously elevated depressive-symptom range into the non-depressed range. Trait anxiety (STAI) likewise decreased substantially from 54 to 37 (Δ = -17, Z-Score of Δ = -1.94), shifting classification from “anxious” to “not anxious.” Rosenberg self-esteem increased slightly (+2 points) while self-reported happiness declined by one point and interpersonal trust decreased modestly. Taken together, the largest and most clinically meaningful changes in this domain are the large reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom scores, which are strongly relevant for perceived stress.

Sleep-related measures present a mixed but generally favorable pattern when objective wearable data are prioritized alongside subjective reports. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration increased substantially (from 6 h 15 m to 8 h 32 m; Δ ≈ +2 h 16 m, Z-Score of Δ = 2.54) and night-to-night start-time variability decreased, indicating longer and more regular nocturnal sleep by objective measurement. In contrast, self-report indicates a much longer prior “normal weekday” duration (12 h) that has decreased to 9 h, and self-reported sleep latency increased sharply (30 → 120 minutes). The combination suggests that objective sleep quantity and regularity improved, while subjective sleep initiation problems increased; this pattern could reflect reduced overall sleep debt but persistent or increased pre-sleep arousal or difficulty initiating sleep.

Physiological signals from the wearable support a net reduction in basal physiological arousal but a change in daily timing of arousal. Resting heart rate decreased by ~4.2 bpm (67.8 → 63.6), a change that commonly accompanies reduced tonic sympathetic activation or improved cardiovascular fitness. Circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability, intradaily variability, autocorrelation at 24 hours) are essentially stable, while amplitude increased modestly and mesor decreased slightly. The acrophase shifted later (from ~4:05 PM to ~6:50 PM) and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows relatively higher evening heart rates in the current wave compared with the prior wave, indicating a later and stronger evening peak of cardiovascular activity. These findings suggest lower baseline physiological stress but a circadian shift toward later-day/nighttime physiological activation.

Behavioral and lifestyle data show several changes consistent with improved psychosocial functioning and some health risks. Socializing time increased (from ~15 minutes to 1–2 hours), sedentary hobby time and listening-to-music hours decreased, and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration and higher health satisfaction. Exercise frequency increased slightly (from none to rare solo sessions). Substance and recreational drug use remain absent. However, BMI increased by ~2.4 points, and self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust declined modestly. The increase in social interaction and perceived health satisfaction is concordant with the large reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms, while the BMI change and lowered trust/happiness represent potential areas of concern.

Holistic synthesis for perceived-stress direction: strong, convergent evidence points toward a net improvement (decrease) in perceived stress. The largest signals—marked reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom scores, a lower resting heart rate, longer and more regular objective sleep duration, increased socializing, and higher health satisfaction—are all factors that typically accompany reduced perceived stress. Contrasting signals (worsened subjective sleep latency, later acrophase and higher evening heart rates, decreased trust and happiness, increased BMI) are notable but smaller in magnitude or more circumscribed. Given the magnitude and consistency of improvements in mood and core physiological baseline, the overall pattern is most consistent with a decrease or stable-lowered level of perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

45076,-9.0,"Multimodal summary and psychological symptom change:
Self-report affective measures show a mixed but generally improved profile on mood and anxiety indices. The CES-D depressive symptom score fell substantially (15 → 6), indicating a marked reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety measured by the STAI decreased modestly (44 → 40), and a single-item happiness rating increased (3 → 4). These changes point toward reduced negative affect and anxiety and modestly greater momentary well-being since the prior assessment. In contrast, self-esteem declined (score change of −8), representing a notable reduction in perceived self-worth that diverges from the improvements in mood and anxiety. Health satisfaction changed only slightly downward.

Behavioral and contextual changes:
Several behavioral activities shifted substantially. Time spent watching TV/videos and other sedentary hobbies increased markedly (each rising by multiple categories to “more than 4 hours”), and reported internet use rose from a very low level to several hours per day. Socializing with friends also increased considerably. Exercise frequency remained high and stable. Substance use patterns were unchanged. Self-reported sleep preferences and habits diverged: desired weekday sleep increased (wants 9 hours), reported normal weekday sleep increased by 1 hour (6 → 7), but objective sleep from the wearable shows the opposite pattern (see below). Importantly, the participant reported a loss of perceived control over sleep duration (shift from “Somewhat Agree” to “Disagree”), which may reflect subjective difficulty in regulating sleep despite reporting a higher ideal and normal weekday sleep in the survey.

Wearable-derived sleep, heart rate, and circadian metrics:
Objective sleep and circadian measures indicate worsening sleep timing and circadian regularity. Median nightly sleep duration recorded by the wearable decreased by about 46 minutes (7:38 → 6:52), and median sleep start time shifted later by roughly 1.5 hours (00:57 → 02:27), with greater night-to-night variability in start times. Circadian regularity metrics show lower interdaily stability (current z ≈ −1.38) and higher intradaily variability (current z ≈ 1.63), and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined, together suggesting reduced day-to-day consistency and increased fragmentation of activity/heart-rate rhythms. Cosinor-derived amplitude declined while MESOR (mean level) increased, indicating a flatter but elevated heart rate rhythm overall.

Physiological arousal patterning:
Resting heart rate increased modestly (~1.6 bpm), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows higher mean heart rates across many daytime and evening hours compared with the previous wave, including notable elevations in evening and late-night hours. The combination of an elevated MESOR, higher hourly heart rates, and later sleep onset is consistent with increased physiological activation across the daily cycle and reduced circadian amplitude, which can be associated with stress, disrupted sleep, or altered activity timing.

Integrative interpretation and implications for perceived stress (PSS):
Evidence is mixed. Self-report symptom scales tied closely to affective state—depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—both decreased, and happiness increased; these changes provide direct indications that subjective distress has lessened, which would predict a decrease in perceived stress. Conversely, objective physiology and sleep/circadian markers (shorter sleep duration, later and more variable bedtimes, reduced interdaily stability, increased intradaily variability, and modestly higher resting/mean heart rate) point toward greater physiological arousal and circadian disruption, patterns commonly associated with higher stress burden or poorer recovery. Behavioral context changes (increased sedentary screen time and internet use) could reflect either coping behaviors or lifestyle shifts that exacerbate physiological dysregulation. The decline in perceived control over sleep and the drop in self-esteem further complicate the picture: these are subjective indicators that can contribute to maintained or increased perceived stress despite lower depressive and anxiety symptom scores.

Holistic assessment:
Weighing the evidence, the strongest direct indicators of perceived internal distress (CES-D, STAI, and self-reported happiness) moved in the direction of improvement, and these scales are conceptually closer to perceived stress than isolated physiological markers. The physiological and sleep/circadian data, however, show meaningful deterioration in sleep timing and circadian regularity and modestly increased cardiovascular activation, suggesting that the participant is experiencing greater activation and behavioral irregularity that could elevate stress if sustained. Given the prominence and magnitude of the reductions in depressive symptoms and the modest improvement in anxiety and happiness—measures that align closely with subjective stress experience—I conclude that perceived stress is more likely to have stayed stable or decreased overall relative to the prior wave, although the concurrent physiological and sleep disruptions indicate risk for future increases if those patterns persist.

27306,3.0,"Summary of self-report psychological state and behavior:
Compared with the prior wave, self-report measures indicate a net reduction in internalizing symptom burden and a concomitant increase in positive affect. CES-D depressive symptoms declined by 4 points (from 6 to 2), and STAI–Trait anxiety declined by 7 points (from 37 to 30); both raw changes move the participant further from the sample mean (negative Z-scores) and represent the largest symptom shifts in the survey set. Self-reported happiness rose substantially (+2 points) and interpersonal trust increased slightly, while global self-esteem remained essentially stable (−1 point). Health satisfaction decreased modestly (−0.89 on a 1–7 scale). Substance use and solitary exercise frequency were unchanged; exercise with others decreased by one category and time spent socializing in daily recreation decreased modestly. Taken together, the affective and trait-anxiety indicators point toward reduced psychological distress, whereas reduced social interaction and a small drop in health satisfaction provide countervailing signals that may modestly limit the degree of improvement.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure:
Cardiovascular indices show clear change in the direction typically associated with lower tonic physiological arousal or improved fitness. Resting heart rate fell markedly (45.1 → 39.7 bpm; Δ = −5.4 bpm; Z-Score change ≈ −1.1), and the circadian mesor declined modestly. Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show lower mean values across many daytime and nighttime hours relative to the previous wave, consistent with the lower resting rate. Circadian phase shifted earlier (acrophase from ~2:13 PM to ~12:41 PM), while amplitude was essentially unchanged and interdaily stability decreased slightly with a small increase in intradaily variability. These changes suggest a lower basal cardiovascular set point and a modest reorganization of daily heart-rate timing: reduced overall arousal with slightly less stable day-to-day rhythm but preserved amplitude of daily variation.

Sleep behavior and timing:
Objective sleep metrics show a small reduction in median nightly sleep duration (∼17 minutes shorter) but with reduced night-to-night variability (SD decreased by ~28 minutes) and more consistent sleep start times (sleep start SD decreased). Median sleep start shifted later by ~39 minutes, and self-reported normal weekday sleep duration increased from 6.0 to 6.5 hours, while subjective perceived control over sleep also improved slightly. Overall, objective sleep quantity edged downward but timing became more regular and subjective sleep duration and perceived control improved. The pattern is mixed but leans toward greater consistency in sleep timing and subjective satisfaction, which can support reductions in perceived stress even if total minutes are marginally lower.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress (PSS):
The participant’s initial PSS of 21 (slightly below sample mean by Z ≈ −0.17) combined with the available multimodal changes indicates more evidence supporting a decline in perceived stress than evidence of worsening. Key converging indicators for decreased stress are substantial reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, a marked increase in self-reported happiness, lowered resting heart rate and broadly reduced heart-rate levels across the day, and improved regularity of sleep timing. Contrasting signals include a modest decline in health satisfaction, reduced socializing and fewer exercise sessions with others, and a slightly shorter objective sleep duration; these could attenuate or slow stress improvement but do not outweigh the stronger, consistent reductions in negative affect and physiological arousal. Correlations provided with change are small in magnitude for most measures; the negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change (−0.56) suggests regression toward lower PSS for those starting higher, consistent with the observed symptom reductions. On balance, the preponderance of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators aligns with a decrease or stabilization (improvement) in perceived stress since the previous wave.

46365,4.0,"Self-report measures show a marked deterioration in mood-related domains that are closely linked to perceived stress. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, increased substantially (from 12 to 26; large positive Z-score change), moving the participant from the ""not depressed"" to the ""depressed"" classification. Trait anxiety (STAI) increased moderately (45 to 48), and self-esteem declined slightly. These changes are directionally consistent with increased subjective distress: the CES-D delta in particular has a positive association with PSS change in the provided correlations. At the same time, the participant reports a large improvement in health satisfaction, which may reflect either true improvements in perceived physical health or a shift in appraisal that is independent of mood symptoms.

Behavioral habit changes are mixed in ways that could plausibly both mitigate and exacerbate stress. The participant increased frequency of solitary exercise markedly (now exercising alone three times per week or more), which typically supports physiological resilience and can lower perceived stress. However, there are concurrent increases in substance use (greater wine/liquor consumption and initiation/increase of recreational and non-prescribed drug use) and a large reduction in time spent socializing and using the internet relative to the prior wave. The pattern—more solitary exercise but less social contact and greater substance use—suggests a change in coping strategy toward more solitary, substance-involved behaviors rather than increased social support, a pattern that can be associated with worsening perceived stress over time.

Wearable-derived sleep and cardiovascular signals present a mixed picture. Objective nightly sleep duration increased modestly (median +17 minutes) and sleep duration became more consistent (SD decreased), and subjective sleep latency improved; these changes normally indicate better sleep-related recovery. Resting heart rate decreased notably (from 56.5 to 50.6 bpm), consistent with improved cardiovascular conditioning or lower baseline physiological arousal. In contrast, circadian structure weakened: interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation decreased and amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm dropped, while sleep start time variability increased. Reduced circadian regularity and lower rhythmic amplitude are often linked to irregular schedules or fragmented circadian entrainment and can relate to impaired daily functioning and increased perceived stress despite improvements in some sleep and fitness markers.

Integrating the modalities, the strongest and most salient signals pointing toward increased perceived stress are the large rise in depressive symptomatology and a smaller rise in trait anxiety, both of which have positive correlations with PSS change in the auxiliary correlations. Protective signals—improved resting heart rate, slightly longer and more stable sleep duration, and increased health satisfaction—are notable but smaller in magnitude relative to the pronounced worsening of mood symptoms and the emergence of increased substance use and social withdrawal. Circadian weakening further offsets some of the physiological gains. Taken together, the net evidence aligns more consistently with an increase in subjective stress than with stability or improvement.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
72806,-3.0,"Multimodal self-report indicators point toward a broadly more positive psychological profile in the most recent wave. Scores reflecting depressive symptoms and trait anxiety both decreased substantially (CES-D from 5 to 1; STAI-Trait from 33 to 26), accompanied by increases in self-reported happiness (3 → 5) and a small rise in self-esteem (39 → 40). Trust and health-satisfaction also edged upward. These changes are large enough on their scales to suggest reduced negative affect and greater subjective well-being relative to the prior assessment. The initial PSS anchor of 21 (moderate) and its negative correlation with subsequent change (r = -0.56) indicate that participants with a higher baseline tended to show reductions in perceived stress in this sample; this statistical pattern is consistent with the direction of change suggested by the contemporaneous self-report measures.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular measures are concordant with reduced tonic physiological arousal. Resting heart rate declined from 56.0 to 52.1 bpm and MESOR (mean of the circadian fit) decreased, consistent with a lower baseline heart-rate set point across the recording period. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased modestly while amplitude remained similar, and the acrophase shifted earlier (from ~4:51 PM to ~4:05 PM). Hourly aggregated heart rates show lower daytime and nocturnal averages in the current epoch compared with the prior epoch, although there are isolated high evening values in both waves. Taken together, the heart-rate profile is most consistent with reduced overall cardiovascular activation or improved cardiovascular conditioning rather than an increase in physiologic stress.

Sleep-derived metrics give a mixed signal. Median nightly duration decreased only slightly (about 18 minutes), but night-to-night variability increased — both in sleep duration SD (from 85 to 103 minutes) and in sleep start-time SD (increase of ~46 minutes). Median sleep onset shifted later by roughly 10 minutes. The participant also reports wanting more sleep (ideal weekday 9 h) while actual self-reported normal weekday sleep decreased (7 → 6 h). These patterns indicate improved affect and lower basal arousal alongside more inconsistent sleep timing, which can reflect schedule changes or environmental demands and may attenuate some of the benefits associated with the improvements in mood and heart-rate metrics.

Behavioral lifestyle data largely support a shift toward protective routines. Frequency of exercising alone increased (from ~1–2×/week to ~3×/week or more), socializing time increased, and recreational screen time patterns shifted modestly (slightly more internet use but little sedentary hobby change). Alcohol use shows a small increase for beer (one additional use category), BMI increased by 0.76 points, and recreational/non-prescribed drug use remains absent. Overall, the behavioral picture shows greater engagement in physical activity and social contact—both factors typically associated with lower perceived stress—while modest increases in alcohol and variability in sleep may represent countervailing influences.

Holistic assessment and direction of change for perceived stress: most convergent indicators (large reductions in depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, increased happiness and self-esteem, increased exercise and socializing, and lower resting heart rate/MESOR) point to a decrease in perceived stress relative to the prior wave. The principal contrary signals are increased variability in sleep timing/duration and a small uptick in beer use and BMI, which could blunt or complicate recovery but do not outweigh the multiple robust signals of improvement. Given the pattern of improvements across self-report affective measures and supporting reductions in physiologic arousal, the balance of evidence indicates that the participant’s perceived stress has likely decreased or remained stable at a lower level rather than worsened.

67918,-6.0,"The self-report mental health and trait measures show a pattern of reduced self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms between waves. The CES-D score fell from 5.0 to 2.0 (score delta -3.0; Z-score change modest), and the STAI–Trait fell from 35.0 to 27.0 (score delta -8.0; Z-score of current -1.32), indicating lower self-reported depressive symptom frequency and lower trait anxiety in the current wave. Self-reported happiness remained unchanged, while global health satisfaction declined modestly (from 5.89 to 4.89). Self-esteem shows a substantial numeric drop relative to the prior report (score delta -8.0; Z-Score of Delta -1.46), which stands in contrast to the reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom reports and may reflect domain-specific change in self-evaluation independent of mood symptoms.

Behavioral self-reports indicate small shifts in daily activities that could influence perceived stress. Time spent reading and sedentary hobbies increased substantially (reading Z-Score of Delta +1.41; sedentary hobby Z-Score of Delta +1.93), and time spent listening to music increased modestly. Socializing frequency and internet use were stable. Alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor) increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month,” while exercise with others dropped to zero from 1–2 times a month. These changes indicate greater engagement in solitary or sedentary leisure and a small increase in low-frequency alcohol use, alongside reduced social exercise participation.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics reveal a notable reduction in objective nightly sleep duration and a later sleep schedule. Median sleep duration decreased by approximately 55 minutes (from 8 h 42 m to 7 h 46 m; Z-Score of Delta -1.25) and median sleep start time shifted later by ~54 minutes. Sleep timing variability overall decreased (sleep duration SD fell from 74 to 53 minutes), indicating greater night-to-night consistency in duration but with later and shorter sleep on average. Subjective sleep latency and perceived control over sleep duration remained essentially unchanged, and self-reported habitual sleep duration remained at 8 hours, suggesting a partial divergence between objective wearable measurement and self-report.

Cardiovascular and circadian markers show mixed signals. Resting heart rate increased from 64.6 to 67.5 bpm (delta +2.9 bpm; Z-Score of Delta +0.66), and the cosinor-derived amplitude decreased (current amplitude 13.52 from 15.31 previously), indicating a modestly blunted circadian amplitude in heart rate. Mesor increased slightly. Non-parametric circadian metrics are stable-high for interdaily stability (0.66) with a small rise in intradaily variability (0.39 to 0.46), consistent with a well-anchored but slightly more fragmented daily rhythm. Aggregated hourly heart rate profiles show several hours of elevated daytime heart rate relative to the prior wave, although early-night hours are lower; overall the uptick in resting heart rate and reduced amplitude are physiological patterns often associated with increased autonomic load or reduced circadian robustness.

Integrative interpretation: the strongest and most direct indicators of psychological distress (self-reported trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) moved in the direction of improvement, with clinically meaningful decreases in STAI and CES-D scores. Behavioral changes (increased solitary/sedentary leisure, slight increase in alcohol use, decreased social exercise) and reductions in health satisfaction and self-esteem introduce countervailing context that could limit overall well-being. Physiological signals (shorter objective sleep, later sleep timing, increased resting heart rate, reduced circadian amplitude) are consistent with elevated physiological arousal or reduced restorative sleep physiology and thus could argue for increased stress load. Taken together, the weight of evidence favors a reduction in self-reported negative affect and trait anxiety—which are closely aligned with perceived stress measures—despite physiological markers that suggest increased autonomic activation and shorter sleep. Given the magnitude of decreases in trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores and the stability or improvement in many subjective functioning domains (happiness unchanged, stable perceived sleep control), the overall multimodal profile is best interpreted as consistent with a net decrease or stability (rather than worsening) in perceived stress.

34467,1.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological measures and wellbeing:
The self-report measures show small improvements or stability in mood- and trait-related domains. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D decreased by 2 points (7.0 → 5.0), remaining well within the non-clinical range; the change is modest in magnitude (Z-score of the delta ~ -0.09). State/trait anxiety on the STAI increased only 1 point (33 → 34) and remains in the ""not anxious"" range; self-esteem is unchanged at the maximum of the scale (40), and self-reported happiness remains high and stable (5/5). Interpersonal trust increased notably (3.33 → 4.00, Z-score of delta ≈ 1.55) and health satisfaction rose modestly. Taken together, subjective affect and trait measures present either stability or small improvements rather than clear deterioration.

Paragraph 2 — Self-reported behaviors and daily activities:
Reported daytime and leisure behaviors are mostly stable or show small reductions in discretionary social and internet time (socializing and internet use down by one ordinal category each). Exercise frequency — particularly exercise with others — is high and unchanged (three times a week or more). Self-reported weekday sleep shows a perceived decline (normal weekday sleep reported as 6.0 → 5.5 hours) and the participant continues to report lack of control over sleep duration. This contrast between perceived shorter weekday sleep and objective wearable sleep metrics (below) is a notable discrepancy to consider when interpreting stress-related sleep complaints.

Paragraph 3 — Wearable-derived sleep and circadian regularity:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate improved sleep regularity and preserved median sleep duration. Median nightly sleep is essentially unchanged (7 h 24 m → 7 h 22 m), while measures of variability show pronounced improvement: sleep duration SD decreased by ~58 minutes and median sleep-start time SD decreased by ~88 minutes (large negative Z-scores for these deltas), indicating substantially more consistent timing and duration of sleep across nights. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm increased and intradaily variability decreased, consistent with a more regular, less fragmented circadian pattern. The cosinor-derived amplitude increased substantially (7.15 → 12.81; Z-score of delta ≈ 1.91), and acrophase shifted earlier (about 2:47 PM → 1:09 PM), together suggesting stronger and slightly earlier daily rhythmicity. These circadian/sleep regularity changes are among the largest objective shifts observed and generally align with improved behavioral organization.

Paragraph 4 — Cardiovascular physiology and hourly heart-rate patterning:
Resting heart rate decreased meaningfully (46.6 → 42.1 bpm), placing the current resting HR markedly below the study mean (Z ≈ -2.05). Hourly aggregated heart-rate values are lower across many nighttime and early-morning hours relative to the previous wave, with preserved diurnal peaks during morning and late-afternoon hours; overall the profile and lower resting values are consistent with reduced tonic physiological arousal or higher cardiovascular fitness. Autocorrelation at 24 hours and other rhythm regularity indices changed only modestly, but the combination of lower resting HR and increased circadian amplitude supports a shift toward a more consolidated physiological daily pattern.

Paragraph 5 — Integration and inference regarding perceived stress:
Multiple independent indicators point toward stability or modest improvement in stress-related domains. Objective physiology and circadian/sleep regularity show the clearest improvements (large reductions in sleep timing variability, increased rhythm amplitude, lower resting HR). Subjective affective measures (lower CES-D, stable high happiness and self-esteem) and increased trust/health satisfaction further support no worsening and some improvement. The main signals inconsistent with improvement are the participant's self-reported reduction in normal weekday sleep and continued report of low perceived control over sleep, plus a tiny rise in trait anxiety of one point; however, these are small relative to the objective improvements in sleep regularity and physiological markers. Correlations provided with PSS change are generally small for most deltas, so inferences are probabilistic rather than definitive. The initial PSS (22) is only slightly above the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.1) and the dataset-level correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change is negative (r ≈ -0.56), which suggests individuals with higher initial stress in this sample often show reductions over time; in this participant, the preponderance of evidence (objective circadian/sleep improvements, lower resting HR, better mood indices) is most consistent with stable or decreased perceived stress.

59673,-3.0,"Self-report measures show a pronounced reduction in internalizing symptoms between waves. The CES-D score decreased from 7.0 to 2.0 (Delta = -5.0; Z-change ≈ -0.42) and the STAI–Trait score dropped from 37 to 25 (Delta = -12.0; Z-change ≈ -1.30). Both changes are substantial in magnitude relative to the sample distribution and point toward a lower burden of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety at the current assessment. Convergent subjective indicators that typically track with lower stress—an increase in interpersonal trust (3.83 → 4.50) and higher health satisfaction (2.67 → 3.11)—support an interpretation of improved psychological well-being. By contrast, self-esteem fell modestly (50 → 45) and reported happiness decreased by one point (4 → 3); these are smaller shifts relative to the large improvements in depressive and anxiety symptom scores and should be interpreted as partial, not overriding, signals.

Behavioral and lifestyle data are mixed. Social engagement and some recreational activities increased (socializing time and reading increased), which can buffer stress, but there is a noteworthy escalation in substance-related behaviors: beer consumption rose from monthly to three times weekly (large Z-change ~1.66) and recreational drug use increased from none to infrequent use. Exercise frequency when performed alone remained stable while group exercise decreased slightly. Internet use increased. These behavioral shifts include both adaptive elements (more social time) and risk-related elements (increased alcohol/other substance use and more screen time), suggesting a shift toward greater social activity but also greater reliance on substances and digital media as possible coping strategies.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics generally indicate improved circadian structure with some increased variability within days. Interdaily stability increased substantially (0.43 → 0.58; Z-change ≈ +1.15), and circadian amplitude rose (11.5 → 13.6; Z-change ≈ +0.71), consistent with stronger day-to-day regularity and a larger day–night heart rate contrast. Resting heart rate declined slightly (58.5 → 57.0 bpm), consistent with modest reductions in cardiovascular arousal. At the same time, intradaily variability increased (0.47 → 0.64) and sleep timing variability increased markedly (sleep start SD rose from 98 to 172 minutes; Z-change ≈ +1.52), indicating greater within-day fragmentation and irregular sleep timing despite an unchanged median sleep duration (~7h30m). Aggregated hourly heart-rate patterns show higher evening heart rates in the current wave compared with the prior wave, which may reflect increased evening arousal or activity patterns despite overall modestly lower resting heart rate.

Integrating the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward a reduction in perceived stress. Large decreases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are primary indicators that typically co-vary with PSS change; these are supported by physiological signs of improved circadian amplitude and slightly lower resting heart rate, and by increased perceived control over sleep and higher interpersonal trust and health satisfaction. Offsetting risks—most notably the marked increase in alcohol use, the emergence of some recreational drug use, greater sleep timing variability, and a small fall in self-esteem and happiness—represent important negative trends that could undermine sustained stress improvement, but their pattern and relative magnitudes appear secondary to the broad reductions in internal distress and the improvements in circadian regulation. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with a decrease or stabilization at a lower level of perceived stress rather than with a net increase.

Self-reported happiness was unchanged and interpersonal trust increased slightly. Health satisfaction decreased modestly (from 5.33 to 4.78). Taken together, the sizable reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are strong subjective signals consistent with reduced perceived stress, while small declines in health satisfaction provide a counterpoint but are limited in magnitude.

Behavioral routines that buffer stress appear largely maintained or improved. The participant reports continued frequent exercise (alone three+ times/week; group and sports activity steady), stable low recreational drug use, and modest increases in socializing time and internet use. Alcohol use remained unchanged. Sleep-related self-report metrics (habitual weekday sleep duration ~7 hours, sleep latency ~10 minutes, desired sleep 8 hours) are stable, and the participant reports a small improvement in perceived control over sleep. These behavioral patterns (regular exercise, greater social engagement, stable perceived sleep) generally align with lower or stable perceived stress.

Paragraph 3 — Objective sleep and circadian metrics from wearables:
Wearable-recorded sleep duration increased slightly (median +14 minutes to 7 h 41 m), but objective sleep timing shifted later (median sleep start moved ~40 minutes later) and night-to-night variability increased (sleep-duration SD +27 minutes; start-time SD +21 minutes). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate weaker time-of-day structure: interdaily stability declined (0.44 → 0.29), autocorrelation at 24 hours dropped markedly (0.28 → 0.10), and amplitude of the fitted rhythm decreased substantially (13.6 → 7.7). The acrophase shifted later (peak heart-rate time moved from ~4:02 PM to ~5:46 PM). These changes indicate increased circadian irregularity and a flattened daily rhythm, which often accompany physiological or lifestyle stressors despite the small increase in total sleep time.

Paragraph 4 — Cardiovascular physiology and inferred arousal:
Resting heart rate increased by ~5 bpm (47.2 → 52.2), and aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher mean heart rates across many nocturnal and some diurnal hours relative to the prior wave. The mesor increased slightly while amplitude decreased, producing a pattern of higher baseline with reduced day–night contrast. Increased resting heart rate and elevated overnight hourly heart rates are objective indicators of greater physiological arousal or reduced parasympathetic tone. Correlations between these physiologic deltas and changes in PSS are small in the available data, but the magnitude of the RHR increase and circadian flattening are notable from a physiological standpoint.

Paragraph 5 — Integration and interpretation focused on perceived stress direction:
Subjective symptom measures (notably large reductions in CES-D and STAI-T) and maintained positive behaviors (regular exercise, increased socializing) provide substantial evidence consistent with decreased perceived stress since the prior wave. Conversely, objective physiology and circadian metrics (increased resting heart rate, flattened amplitude, lower interdaily stability, later and more variable sleep timing) point toward increased physiological arousal and circadian disruption, which can be associated with higher stress. The available correlation coefficients for deltas are small, and the initial PSS was relatively high (25) with a negative correlation to change (suggesting regression toward improvement). Weighing subjective psychological improvements, behavioral buffering (exercise, social contact), and the strong magnitudes of change in CES-D/STAI more heavily for perceived stress (a subjective construct), the overall balance of evidence favors a reduction or stability (not a worsening) of perceived stress despite signs of physiological dysregulation that warrant monitoring.

77872,-6.0,"Summary of self-reported psychological state: Across standard self-report instruments, the participant shows small but consistent movement toward lower internalizing symptom burden and modestly stronger self-evaluation. The CES-D score decreased from 11 to 9 and the STAI-Trait score decreased from 33 to 31, both changes in the direction of fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms. Rosenberg self-esteem increased slightly (44 → 45). Interpersonal trust rose marginally and self-reported happiness remained unchanged. Health satisfaction declined modestly. The pattern of these questionnaire changes—reduction in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety together with a small rise in self-esteem and trust—argues for modest improvement in affective/trait indicators relevant to perceived stress.

Sleep behavior and circadian regularity: Sleep measures present a mixed but concerning picture for sleep quantity and stability. Self-reported normal weekday sleep duration declined substantially (6.5 → 5.5 hours, a 1-hour decrease), and the participant reports less perceived control over sleep duration (a one-point drop in the response category). Wearable-derived median sleep duration declined modestly (6h50m → 6h29m) and night-to-night variability increased (sleep duration SD increased from 64 to 90 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 25 minutes but timing variability also increased. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate show decreased interdaily stability (0.47 → 0.40) and increased intradaily variability, indicating less regular daily structure and more fragmentation in the circadian pattern. Together, objective and subjective sleep/circadian data indicate reduced sleep quantity and greater irregularity, which are behavioral factors that commonly relate to higher perceived stress.

Physiological and activity-related signals: Resting heart rate decreased from 58.6 to 55.3 bpm, a change consistent with lower tonic cardiovascular arousal or improved fitness. Cosinor-derived circadian amplitude and mesor decreased slightly while acrophase shifted earlier by ~30 minutes; autocorrelation at 24 hours increased, suggesting some preservation of 24-hour rhythm despite lower day-to-day regularity. Hourly aggregated heart rate profiles continue to show pronounced daytime/evening peaks (largest values in late afternoon/early evening), consistent with typical wake-day activity; overall daytime values are similar to prior values with moderate hour-to-hour differences. Behavioral activities show reduced alcohol frequency (beer use down from weekly to monthly) and reduced exercise with others but increased sporadic sports participation; socializing time is stable. These physiological and behavioral changes are mixed: lower resting HR and reduced alcohol use point toward lower stress/arousal, while decreased social exercise and reduced regularity may attenuate resilience to stress.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress change: The multimodal pattern contains both signals supportive of decreased perceived stress and signals that could indicate increased stress vulnerability. On balance, the most salient positive signals are reductions in depressive and trait-anxiety scores, a small rise in self-esteem/trust, lowered resting heart rate, and reduced alcohol frequency. The most salient negative signals are a substantial self-reported reduction in weekday sleep duration and increased sleep timing and duration variability together with reduced interdaily stability of circadian rhythm. Given the magnitude and consistency of psychometric improvements and the physiological marker of lower resting heart rate, weighed against the sleep/circadian deterioration that represents a significant but behaviorally specific risk, the overall balance favors a stable to decreased level of perceived stress relative to the prior wave rather than a worsening.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
72348,-1.0,"Between the two measurement waves the participant shows notable shifts on self-report psychological measures that are relevant to perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI) increased from 39 to 43, moving from the study’s ""not anxious"" range into the ""anxious"" classification; the score delta (+4) and its positive delta-correlation with PSS change (0.19) indicate this increase is plausibly associated with greater perceived stress. Depressive symptom frequency (CES-D) rose substantially from 6 to 13 (Δ = +7), though the measure remains in a nonclinical range; this change also has a modest positive correlation with PSS change (0.26). In contrast, self-esteem increased by 3 points and trust and health satisfaction show small positive increases; these latter trends are protective or stabilizing factors but have weak negative or near-zero correlations with PSS change. Overall, the psychological self-report pattern is mixed but weighted toward increased internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depressive symptoms), which are commonly linked with increased perceived stress.

Sleep-related data present a nuanced picture of subjective versus objective sleep. Subjective weekday sleep duration decreased from 7.5 to 7.0 hours and self-reported sleep latency lengthened from 20 to 30 minutes, suggesting the participant perceives some worsening in sleep quality or quantity. Wearable-derived sleep metrics, however, show median sleep duration remained effectively stable and long (approximately 8 hours 23 minutes) with slightly reduced night-to-night variability. The discrepancy between shorter self-reported weekday sleep and stable objective median sleep may reflect changes in perception or weekday-specific schedule demands. The modest increase in reported sleep latency and reduction in perceived weekday sleep hours could contribute to elevated perceived stress, but the objective sleep stability partially counters that inference.

Wearable circadian and cardiac metrics indicate both stabilizing and destabilizing changes. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation remain high and unchanged, suggesting preserved day-to-day circadian regularity. Intradaily variability increased (0.50 → 0.61), consistent with more fragmentation or irregularity of activity within days; this change has a small positive correlation with PSS change. Resting heart rate decreased by about 3.1 bpm (68.6 → 65.5), and HR mesor declined slightly, which can reflect reduced basal physiological arousal or improved cardiovascular fitness; these changes have negligible correlation with PSS change. HR amplitude increased and the acrophase shifted later (approx. 2:42 PM → 3:34 PM), indicating a modest phase delay and greater day–night HR contrast. Aggregated hourly heart rates are lower at many hours compared with the prior wave, aligning with the reduced resting HR. Taken together, physiological signals show lower baseline cardiac activation but greater within-day variability, suggesting a complex mix of improved baseline recovery alongside increased daytime irregularity.

Behavioral habits shift in ways that could affect perceived stress. The participant reports exercising alone more frequently (from monthly to weekly), which is typically advantageous for stress regulation. Conversely, time spent socializing decreased and television viewing increased; internet usage decreased. Substance use remains absent. Reduced social contact combined with increases in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms is a pattern more consistent with increased subjective stress, despite some compensatory health behaviors (more exercise, improved perceived health). Considering the relative magnitudes and clinical relevance of changes, the rise in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms—together with increased intraday variability and reduced social engagement—provide stronger evidence of worsening perceived stress than the countervailing signals of lower resting heart rate, stable objective sleep duration, and modest gains in self-esteem and health satisfaction.

Weighing all sources holistically, the most salient and stress-relevant changes are the increases in trait anxiety and depressive symptom reporting, the decrease in socializing, and the increase in intradaily variability; these trends point toward elevated subjective stress. Physiological and behavioral improvements (lower resting HR, stable objective sleep duration, more frequent exercise) are noteworthy but do not fully offset the psychological symptom increases. On balance, the evidence supports an increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
28312,-5.0,"Psychological self-report and behavior
Compared with the prior wave, self-report measures show a modest shift toward lower internalizing symptoms and slightly higher self-regard. Trait anxiety (STAI) decreased by 5 points (Z-change ≈ -0.40), and depressive symptoms (CES-D) decreased by 1 point; self-esteem increased by 1 point. Self-reported happiness was unchanged, trust increased slightly, and overall health satisfaction fell modestly. Daily activities show a movement toward more sedentary, screen-centered leisure: time watching video content and gaming increased markedly (large positive Z-changes), internet use rose, and a previously modest level of exercising with others declined. Substance use remained stable. Taken together, the self-report pattern indicates reduced reported anxiety and marginally improved mood/self-esteem, accompanied by increased sedentary recreational behavior and a small decline in perceived health.

Sleep and subjective sleep control
Objective sleep from the wearable shows longer and more consistent nocturnal sleep: median sleep duration increased by about 38 minutes to 8h14m (Z ≈ +1.06) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration fell sharply (SD drop from 123 min to 36 min; Z-change ≈ -1.96). Median sleep start time is slightly later (~26 minutes), while variability in sleep start time is essentially unchanged. Subjective sleep latency is unchanged and the participant reports a reduced sense of control over sleep duration (moved from “Somewhat Agree” to “Neither Agree nor Disagree”). Overall, objective sleep quantity and regularity improved substantially, while subjective control over sleep decreased slightly.

Cardiovascular tone and circadian organization
Resting heart rate and aggregated hourly heart rates are lower across the day relative to the previous wave (resting HR down ≈ 0.6 bpm; population Z small), and average hourly HR values show a general downward shift from previously elevated daytime peaks (previous mid-to-late-afternoon values in the high 90s have fallen into the 70s–80s). These changes are consistent with a reduction in tonic cardiovascular arousal. At the same time, cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics indicate a weakening of the rhythmic structure: mesor decreased substantially (Δ ≈ -12.9 bpm, Z-change ≈ -2.58), amplitude decreased (Z-change ≈ -1.6), autocorrelation at 24 h fell markedly (large negative Z-change), and intradaily variability increased (Z-change ≈ +1.41). Interdaily stability remained essentially unchanged. In sum, mean cardiovascular level is lower but the day-to-day and within-day rhythmic robustness of heart-rate cycles is reduced and within-day fragmentation is higher.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress
Multiple lines of evidence point toward reduced perceived physiological and psychological stress: decreased trait anxiety, slight reduction in depressive symptoms, increased sleep duration with markedly reduced night-to-night variability, and a modest lowering of resting and average heart rates. These changes align with improvement in common markers tied to lower perceived stress. Conversely, the increase in intradaily variability, reduction in circadian amplitude/24-h autocorrelation, decreased health satisfaction, and increased sedentary/screen-based leisure are indicators of dysregulated daily structure and potentially less adaptive coping or lifestyle shifts; these elements could counterbalance stress reductions or indicate other lifestyle changes not captured by PSS alone. Correlations provided for individual metric deltas with PSS change are generally small and do not override the multimodal pattern.

Overall assessment of direction of perceived stress
Weighing the stronger signals—notably the substantial improvements in objective sleep quantity and consistency, the decrease in trait anxiety, reductions in mean cardiovascular arousal, and a small improvement in depressive symptoms—against the mixed evidence of degraded circadian rhythmicity and increased sedentary behavior, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s perceived stress has not worsened and is more consistent with stability or modest improvement relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
26800,4.0,"Self-report psychological measures indicate a consistent shift toward lower self-reported distress and higher positive affect. Trait anxiety (STAI) declined markedly by 10 points (from 40 to 30), a large within-subject change that places current anxiety well below the cohort mean (Z ≈ -1.0). Self-esteem rose by 5 points and self-reported happiness increased by 2 points, both sizable relative changes with positive Z-score shifts. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) remained low and stable. Taken together, these psychosocial self-reports point toward reduced subjective anxiety and improved self-evaluative affect since the prior wave.

Lifestyle and activity patterns show a mixed but largely favorable profile for stress buffering. The participant reports more frequent exercise (both exercising alone and with others increased from very low to moderate frequencies), reduced wine/liquor use (from weekly to monthly), and small increases in social trust. Some sedentary leisure (video games and sedentary hobby time) increased, and participation in organized sports decreased; however, the net change toward more intentional exercise is notable. Self-reported weekday sleep duration and perceived control over sleep both increased (weekday sleep from ~6 to 7 hours and stronger agreement about control), which typically aligns with improved functioning and lower perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures corroborate the self-report improvements in sleep regularity and daily structure. Median nightly sleep duration increased by about 30 minutes, sleep start time shifted earlier by ~32 minutes, and night-to-night variability in start time declined. Circadian regularity showed large positive shifts: interdaily stability rose substantially (delta Z ~ +2.4), autocorrelation at 24 hours increased, and amplitude of the fitted rhythm increased markedly. These changes indicate a stronger, more consistent 24-hour heart-rate rhythm and more regular sleep–wake timing, patterns that are generally associated with better recovery and lower stress load.

Physiological arousal patterns are broadly consistent with reduced nocturnal disturbance and greater daytime rhythmicity, with some caveats. Aggregated hourly heart rates show lower values through much of the late-night and early-morning window in the current recordings compared with the previous period, suggesting reduced nocturnal activation. Resting heart rate increased modestly (≈ +2.6 bpm) but remains low relative to the study population (Z ≈ -1.0); this small increase is of uncertain clinical significance and is contrasted with stronger circadian rhythmicity and improved sleep metrics. Overall, the wearable data suggest improved circadian stability and nocturnal quiescence despite a minimal upward shift in resting heart rate.

Evidence for a worsening of perceived stress is limited. Few objective or subjective indicators moved in a direction typically associated with increased stress: resting heart rate rose slightly and engagement in some sedentary leisure increased. However, the magnitude of these changes is small relative to the pronounced, concordant improvements in trait anxiety, positive affect, sleep duration and regularity, exercise frequency, and circadian stability. Correlations between individual metric changes and PSS change are generally small, and initial PSS shows a moderate negative correlation with change (−0.56), which suggests regression toward lower scores for those initially higher, but direct PSS change values are not provided.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically, the balance of large, concordant improvements in anxiety, affect, sleep quality and timing, exercise frequency, and circadian regularity outweighs the small and equivocal signs that might point to increased physiological arousal. Therefore the overall pattern is most consistent with stable or decreased perceived stress relative to the prior data collection.

60396,-1.0,"Multimodal psychological profile — self-report. Compared with the prior wave, the participant reports a notable increase in symptoms consistent with elevated distress: CES-D increased from 8 to 14 and STAI–Trait increased from 42 to 46. Self-esteem changed minimally (33 → 34) and self-reported happiness was unchanged, but global satisfaction with physical health fell sharply (5.44 → 1.44). These changes point to a concurrent rise in internalizing symptoms (depressive symptoms and trait anxiety) alongside a large drop in perceived health, which together constitute psychosocial signals typically associated with greater perceived stress.

Objective and subjective sleep patterns. Wearable-recorded sleep duration decreased by about one hour (median sleep 7h23m → 6h22m) and sleep start times became far more variable (start-time SD increased from 53 to 153 minutes). The participant’s self-report indicates modest reductions in normal weekday sleep (7.0 → 6.5 hours) and a reduced sense of control over sleep duration. Although sleep latency improved subjectively (15 → 5 minutes), the combination of shorter, more irregular sleep and reduced perceived control over sleep is consistent with worse restorative sleep and greater behavioral instability that commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology. Multiple circadian-structure metrics derived from heart rate show loss of 24-hour rhythmic stability: interdaily stability, intradaily variability, and autocorrelation at 24 hours all declined substantially (each with large negative Z-scores for the current values and deltas), indicating weaker and less consistent circadian organization across days. The MESOR (average HR) and resting heart rate increased (resting HR 45.1 → 53.0 bpm), and aggregated hourly heart rate shows pronounced elevations across daytime hours—particularly mid-morning—relative to the previous wave. Together these patterns indicate higher overall cardiovascular activation and a disruption of regular daily rhythmicity, physiological profiles that commonly accompany elevated stress or arousal.

Behavioral habits and health-related behaviors. The participant reports increased frequency of beer consumption and initiation of occasional recreational drug use, while wine consumption decreased. Exercise frequency increased (exercising alone three times per week or more), and time spent passive recreational activities (TV, gaming) decreased; BMI rose modestly (24.36 → 25.10). The mixed pattern—greater physical activity but increased substance use and declining health satisfaction—suggests compensatory or coping-related behavioral changes rather than uniformly healthier lifestyle change.

Integrated interpretation and inference about perceived stress. Convergent signals point toward an increase in perceived stress since the prior wave: rising depressive symptom and trait anxiety scores, marked decline in health satisfaction, shorter and more variable sleep, degraded circadian regularity, and higher resting and daytime heart rate together form a coherent pattern consistent with elevated psychological and physiological stress load. Some behaviors (increased exercise, stable self-esteem and happiness) are potentially protective, but they do not outweigh the substantial and multi-domain indications of worsening stress-related functioning. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports an increase in perceived stress relative to the previous data collection.

92412,3.0,"Multimodal summary — sleep and circadian physiology:
Across wearable and self-report sleep measures the participant shows clear improvements in sleep quantity and regularity. Median sleep duration increased by ~32 minutes to 8 h 20 m (Z = 1.18) and night-to-night variability fell substantially (SD reduced from ~62 to 23 minutes; Z-change ~ -0.83). Sleep onset shifted earlier by ~25 minutes and start time variability declined markedly (from ~49 to 14 minutes). Complementing these subjective and objective sleep gains, circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate show increased interdaily stability (0.55 → 0.61; Z-change 0.48) and a modest rise in amplitude, while acrophase shifted earlier (6:32 PM → 4:31 PM). These patterns indicate more consistent, earlier-timed sleep and a stronger 24-hour structure in heart rate.

Multimodal summary — cardiovascular physiology:
Cardiovascular indices are consistent with reduced physiological arousal. Resting heart rate decreased from 53.8 to 50.2 bpm (Δ = -3.6; Z-change ≈ -0.72) and the cosinor mesor declined (68.5 → 64.1). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower mean heart rates across many daytime and nocturnal hours relative to the prior wave. Taken together with increased circadian stability, these findings are most compatible with reduced tonic physiological activation or improved cardiovascular fitness/parasympathetic tone during the current recording period.

Multimodal summary — psychological trait and lifestyle measures:
Self-report psychological measures are largely stable or modestly improved. Trait anxiety (STAI) decreased from 32 to 28 (Z ≈ -1.22), depressive symptoms (CES-D) remained very low and unchanged (3.0), and self-reported health satisfaction increased by 1.0 point. Self-esteem changed minimally (44 → 43). Behavioral changes are mixed: the participant maintained frequent solitary exercise and sports participation, but reported a large reduction in exercising with others (from frequent to none). Alcohol use increased from “not at all” to ~1–2 times per month for both beer and wine, while recreational drug and non-prescribed drug use remained absent. Leisure activities shifted toward less passive media time (watching TV decreased to zero) and less listening to music.

Evidence consistent with worsening perceived stress:
A few behavioral shifts could be interpreted as potential risk signals for increased perceived stress: a substantial reduction in exercising with others (social exercise down markedly) may reflect reduced social support or fewer social buffers; initiation of low-frequency alcohol use is a small potential stress-related coping change; the participant reports slightly less perceived control over sleep duration (from “Strongly Agree” to “Agree”), and self-esteem decreased by one point. These changes are relatively small in magnitude and show weak correlations with PSS change in the provided deltas.

Evidence consistent with improvement or stability in perceived stress:
Multiple converging signals indicate stability or improvement in perceived stress. Trait anxiety decreased by four points, depressive symptoms remained minimal, and health satisfaction increased. Objective sleep improved in both duration and regularity—changes that are commonly associated with lower perceived stress. Heart-rate markers show lower resting rates and a lower mesor, and circadian stability increased; these physiological shifts align with reduced tonic arousal. Happiness and trust scores are high and stable. Most change correlations provided are small, but the direction and magnitude of objective sleep and cardiovascular improvements together with lower trait anxiety provide substantive evidence that perceived stress has not worsened and is more consistent with stability or improvement.

Holistic interpretation and directional assessment:
Weighing the evidence across domains, the strongest and most consistent signals (longer, more regular sleep; improved circadian stability; lower resting heart rate and mesor; reduced trait anxiety; increased health satisfaction) point toward decreased or at least stable perceived stress relative to the prior wave. Negative indicators (reduced social exercise, modest initiation of alcohol use, slight drop in perceived sleep control and self-esteem) are present but smaller in magnitude and less consistent with the physiological and sleep improvements. On balance, the multimodal profile supports stability or improvement in perceived stress rather than a net increase.

14737,-4.0,"Psychological self-report and behavioral surveys show clear, large-magnitude improvements in affective symptoms and self-view between waves. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) fell markedly (14 → 6), and trait anxiety (STAI) declined by 13 points (45 → 32), with the STAI change moving the participant from the study’s anxious classification to the not-anxious range. Self-esteem increased by 6 points to the top of its scale (34 → 40), and subjective health satisfaction increased modestly. Social engagement and activity patterns also shifted in a direction typically associated with better well-being: reported time socializing rose, frequency of solitary and partner exercise increased, and previously high sedentary hobby time declined substantially. These changes are large relative to the reported population z-scores and indicate broad improvements in mood, social behavior, and self-evaluation.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics provide converging physiological evidence of improved behavioral regulation. Median nightly sleep duration increased by about one hour (6h3m → 7h5m) while night-to-night variability decreased (SD 133 → 89 minutes), and sleep start-time variability fell as well; these changes reflect both longer sleep and more regular sleep timing. Non-parametric circadian stability (interdaily stability) and 24-hour autocorrelation increased (interdaily stability 0.40 → 0.55; autocorrelation Δ = +0.15), and intradaily variability was essentially unchanged, which together indicate a more consistent 24-hour organization of physiological activity. These sleep and rhythm changes are commonly associated with reduced perceived stress and improved mood regulation.

Cardiovascular markers are broadly consistent with reduced baseline physiological arousal. Resting heart rate showed a small decline (53.8 → 53.1 bpm) and the cosinor-derived MESOR decreased by ~4.3 bpm (74.12 → 69.86), while rhythm amplitude increased slightly, and acrophase shifted later by about 20 minutes. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower overnight and some evening peaks relative to the prior wave, though afternoon peaks remain present; overall the pattern suggests a modestly lower baseline (MESOR/resting HR) with preserved daily activity-related elevations. These changes, taken with the improved sleep regularity, point toward modest reductions in tonic physiological arousal and more stable circadian organization.

Behavioral risk factors show mixed but generally small-magnitude changes. The participant began low-frequency alcohol use (beer and wine 1–2 times/month) where previously they reported none; this change is small in frequency but notable as an upward shift. Body-mass index rose by about 1.1 points (21.14 → 22.24). Time spent watching videos and playing video games increased from prior reports, but time spent socializing also increased substantially. Overall, increases in social and exercise behaviors outweigh the small increases in substance use and BMI in terms of expected impact on stress and mood, given the magnitude and context.

Holistic interpretation for perceived stress: convergent signals across domains favor a reduction or stabilization (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave. Large reductions in depressive and anxiety symptomatology, a strong increase in self-esteem, longer and more regular sleep, and improved circadian stability are all strongly associated with decreases in perceived stress. Countervailing evidence for worsening stress is limited and small in magnitude (occasional alcohol use initiation, modest BMI rise, and minor shifts in hourly heart-rate peaks). The study-provided correlation indicating an inverse relation between the initial PSS and subsequent change (initial PSS correlation = -0.56) further suggests that individuals’ starting scores tend to regress toward lower values over time; combined with the participant’s multi-domain improvements, the balance of evidence supports that perceived stress has not increased and is likely stable or decreased.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
28653,-4.0,"Self-report psychological traits and mood: The participant shows marked worsening on multiple self-report measures of affect and trait anxiety. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D increased from 6 to 21 (Δ = +15; Z-score of the change ≈ 1.79), moving classification from “not depressed” to a score in the depressed range. Trait anxiety (STAI) rose substantially from 29 to 46 (Δ = +17; Z-score of the change ≈ 2.43), shifting from a low to a notably higher anxiety range. Concurrently, global self-esteem declined from 49 to 35 (Δ = −14; Z-score of the change ≈ −2.57). Smaller but consistent declines are present in interpersonal trust (−1.0; Z-change ≈ −2.58), self-reported happiness (−1), and health satisfaction (−1.56). These large Z-scored changes indicate meaningful deterioration in mood, anxiety proneness, and self-regard relative to the study population.

Sleep patterns and subjective sleep experience: Objective sleep duration measured by the wearable decreased modestly (median sleep 8h4m → 7h31m; Δ ≈ −32 minutes), with a parallel self-report reduction in normal weekday sleep (8h → 7h; Δ = −1 hour). The participant’s median sleep start time shifted later by about 1 hour and 6 minutes (00:16 → 01:23), with a notable reduction in night-to-night variability of start time (SD 107 min → 55 min). Subjective sleep latency remained very short (3 minutes). Overall these data indicate slightly shorter sleep and later, more consistently late bedtimes compared with the prior wave. The reduction in duration is modest but temporally coincident with worsened mood and anxiety.

Circadian rhythm and heart-rate–derived physiology: Circadian regularity measures derived from heart rate show reduced rhythmicity and a flattened day–night profile. Interdaily stability (day-to-day regularity) decreased from 0.64 to 0.47 (Δ = −0.17; Z-change ≈ −1.22) and autocorrelation at 24 hours dropped substantially (0.48 → 0.24; Z-change ≈ −1.73). Amplitude of the fitted rhythm fell from 19.47 to 13.88 (Δ ≈ −5.59; Z-change ≈ −1.90), while MESOR declined slightly. The acrophase shifted later (≈15:36 → 16:40), consistent with a later timing of peak cardiovascular activity. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher relative heart rates overnight/early night hours in the current period (e.g., 12–1am current ≈ 73 bpm vs previous ≈ 61 bpm) and lower relative daytime peaks than previously. Resting heart rate remained stable (~53 bpm). Together, these patterns indicate a dampening and phase delay of the heart-rate circadian rhythm and increased nocturnal cardiovascular activation relative to the prior recording period.

Daily activities, social behavior, and health behaviors: Several leisure and social behaviors increased: time spent socializing and listening to music rose substantially (socializing from ~16–30 min → 1–2 hours; listening to music from ≤15 min → 1–2 hours). Internet usage also increased modestly. Exercise performed with others remained high (three times a week or more) while exercise done alone decreased in frequency. Substance use remained low and unchanged. These activity shifts suggest greater engagement in social and passive recreational activities (music, internet) and stable group exercise, which represent potential protective or coping behaviors even as solitary exercise declined.

Integration with perceived stress: Changes associated with increased psychological burden (large increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, decreased self-esteem, lower trust and health satisfaction) provide strong evidence consistent with increased perceived stress. Physiological and circadian data support this interpretation: reduced interdaily stability, lower amplitude, later acrophase, and increased nocturnal heart-rate activity are consistent with a phase-delayed, flattened circadian profile and greater nocturnal arousal, patterns often associated with higher stress and poorer affective state. Sleep shortened modestly and shifted later, aligning temporally with the mood and anxiety changes. Countervailing signals include stable resting heart rate and evidence of maintained social engagement and group-based exercise, which could mitigate some stress-related impact; however, these do not counterbalance the magnitude of worsening on affective trait measures and the circadian disruption. Correlations provided with delta PSS are small for individual metrics but the convergent pattern across large self-report changes and circadian disruption points toward an increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
95559,1.0,"The self-report measures indicate notable shifts toward lower self-reported affective symptom burden and higher well-being. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D) decreased by 6 points (from 8 to 2; current Z = -1.12), and trait anxiety (STAI) declined by 4 points (to 25; current Z = -1.53). Self-esteem and momentary happiness both increased (self-esteem +3 points, Z = 1.5; happiness +2 points, Z = 1.6), and health satisfaction rose by ~1.3 points (Z-score change ≈ 1.18). These changes are relatively large in magnitude and point toward reduced self-reported negative affect and greater perceived well-being in the current wave.

Sleep behavior shows consistent objective and subjective improvement. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep increased by about one hour (from 6 h 39 m to 7 h 41 m) while night-to-night variability decreased substantially (sleep duration SD reduced from 97 to 44 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted earlier by ~26 minutes and variability in sleep start time narrowed. Subjective reports mirror this: normal weekday sleep duration increased from 6 to 7 hours and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep. Together, these changes indicate both increased sleep duration and greater sleep regularity—factors that are typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Daily activities and social behavior present a mixed pattern. Socializing time increased (from 1–2 hours to 2–3 hours per day), and participation in sports rose (frequency increased by one category). Internet usage and reported listening to music decreased substantially; other recreational habits were largely unchanged. Alcohol consumption patterns (frequent beer use: three times a week or more) remained stable. Increased social engagement and activity frequency are potential protective factors against stress, whereas sustained frequent alcohol use and an increase in BMI (from 25.11 to 26.54) represent continuing behavioral risks.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological markers show a nuanced picture. Measures of interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation increased modestly, indicating somewhat stronger day-to-day rhythm coupling to a 24-h pattern. Amplitude declined slightly and intradaily variability increased appreciably, suggesting more fragmentation or more frequent transitions between rest and activity states within days. Resting heart rate rose by ~2.3 bpm (from 53.5 to 55.8), and aggregated hourly heart rates are elevated at several evening time points relative to the prior period. These physiological signals can reflect greater momentary autonomic or activity-related arousal even as overall circadian regularity improves. Most reported delta correlations with PSS change are small, so these physiological shifts should be considered alongside the stronger subjective improvements.

Holistic synthesis: the self-report evidence (large reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom scores, increases in self-esteem, happiness, sleep duration and regularity, and greater social time) collectively provides stronger and more consistent evidence of reduced perceived stress than the modest physiological signals suggesting increased within-day fragmentation and a small RHR rise. Behavioral risks (unchanged frequent alcohol use, rising BMI) temper but do not outweigh the psychobehavioral improvements. Taking the multimodal evidence together, the balance favors a decrease or stabilization (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

59592,-4.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological summary:
Objective wearable physiology and circadian metrics show a pattern consistent with reduced physiological arousal and improved 24-hour regularity. Resting heart rate decreased by 2.8 bpm (66.6 → 63.8; Z-Score change ≈ -0.55), which commonly indexes lower baseline sympathetic tone or improved cardiovascular recovery. Intradaily variability, a measure of fragmentation in activity/physiology across the day, decreased substantially (0.83 → 0.57; Z-Score of delta ≈ -2.06), while the autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (0.19 change; Z-Score of delta ≈ 1.2). Those two changes together indicate less within-day fragmentation and stronger day-to-day hour-to-hour structure in heart rate rhythms. The cosinor acrophase shifted earlier by approximately two hours (4:51 PM → 2:50 PM) and median nocturnal sleep start time became earlier by ~54 minutes (01:49 → 00:54). Wearable-derived median sleep duration increased modestly (~22 minutes) even though night-to-night variability in both start time and duration rose slightly. Overall, the objective signal cluster—lower resting HR, lower intradaily variability, higher 24-hour autocorrelation, earlier circadian phase, and modestly longer median sleep—favors a profile of reduced physiological stress load and more consolidated circadian timing.

Self-report and behavioral context:
Self-reported psychological and lifestyle measures present a mixed picture. Trait anxiety (STAI) declined from 46 to 42 (Δ = -4; Z-Score of delta ≈ -0.27), which aligns with the objective reduction in arousal. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) increased slightly (14 → 15), though remaining in the non-depressed range; the magnitude is small. Subjective weekday sleep duration reported by the participant decreased markedly (7.0 → 6.0 hours, Δ = -1 hour), and self-rated health satisfaction declined (3.67 → 3.22), both changes that can be associated with increased perceived stress. Social/behavioral routines changed modestly: group exercise ceased, some sedentary leisure time decreased, reading appeared for brief periods, and alcohol use (wine/liquor) decreased. Many of these behavioral deltas have small correlations with PSS change in this dataset, limiting strong inferences from any single behavioral shift.

Weighing convergent evidence relevant to perceived stress:
Several objective indicators that commonly track with reduced perceived stress are present and of non-trivial magnitude: decreased resting heart rate, markedly reduced intradaily variability, and increased 24‑hour autocorrelation. The STAI (trait anxiety) decline provides additional convergent self-report evidence consistent with reduced stress proneness. Countervailing signals include a small increase in depressive symptoms, a sizeable subjective drop in weekday sleep duration, and lower health satisfaction; these subjective shifts point toward greater perceived strain. Correlations provided in the dataset for individual deltas are generally small in magnitude, and the strongest measurement-level changes with larger standardized shifts are in wearable circadian metrics (intradaily variability and 24-hour autocorrelation) and resting physiology, which tend to be robust markers of changes in physiological stress/arousal. The negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change (Initial PSS correlation with change = -0.56) suggests that participants with higher initial PSS in this sample tend to show decreases on follow-up; this participant’s initial PSS (23, Z ≈ 0.38) sits above the sample mean and is therefore more likely, by sample patterning, to have decreased.

Conclusion about direction of perceived stress change:
Taking the pattern as a whole—objective physiological and circadian indices moving in a direction consistent with reduced arousal and improved 24-hour organization, trait anxiety decreasing, and only modest adverse shifts in mood-related self-report and subjective sleep—the balance of evidence supports that perceived stress has likely improved or remained stable rather than worsened. Therefore the overall direction is best characterized as stable or decreased perceived stress.

69831,-9.0,"Summary integration
Across self-report, wearable-derived physiology, sleep, and behavioral measures, the participant shows a mixed but overall favorable pattern with respect to stress-relevant signals. Objective cardiovascular and circadian markers show clearer improvement (lower resting heart rate, stronger 24-hour autocorrelation, greater interdaily stability, reduced night-to-night sleep variability), while self-report mood and functional measures show modest improvement or stability (notably a halving of the CES-D score) alongside some worsening behavioral habits (reduced exercise, increased sedentary recreation). Taken together, the strongest and most consistent signals—reduced depressive symptoms, more stable sleep timing and duration, and lower basal cardiac activity—point toward reduced physiological and affective burden relative to the prior wave, though some lifestyle changes could blunt long-term benefit.

Psychological self-report pattern
Depressive symptom burden decreased meaningfully (CES-D 10 → 5), which is a robust indicator of reduced negative affect or distress over the past week. Trait anxiety (STAI) is unchanged, and self-esteem declined slightly (36 → 35), both of which are small effects relative to the CES-D change. Self-reported happiness is stable and interpersonal trust rose slightly; health satisfaction also increased modestly. Overall, the self-report profile indicates reduced recent depressive symptoms and modest gains in perceived health and social trust, with trait-level anxiety and self-evaluative beliefs essentially stable.

Sleep and circadian physiology
Objective sleep duration is essentially unchanged but remains healthy (median ~8 h), while night-to-night variability decreased (SD from 104 to 79 minutes), indicating more regular sleep quantity. Median sleep start time is stable (~01:40) with low variability, and the participant reports slightly less perceived control over sleep duration (from “Strongly Agree” to “Agree”). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate improved: interdaily stability increased, autocorrelation at 24 h rose substantially, and intradaily variability remains low. These changes suggest a more consistent daily rhythm and less fragmentation of physiological state across days—factors typically associated with lower stress and better recovery.

Cardiovascular/physiological arousal
Resting heart rate decreased from 55.5 to 52.8 bpm, and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows generally lower levels across many daytime and nighttime hours compared with the prior period. Mesor decreased slightly while amplitude remained stable; acrophase is essentially unchanged. Lower resting heart rate and stronger 24-hour structure are consistent with reduced tonic physiological arousal and improved autonomic regulation, which support an interpretation of reduced stress load or improved physiological recovery.

Behavioral habits and potential risk factors
Exercise frequency declined (notably sports frequency down), while sedentary recreational activities (TV/videos, listening to music, socializing time reported as “more than 4 hours”) increased. Alcohol use and recreational drug use are stable (moderate alcohol frequency, no recreational drug use). The reduction in physical activity is a behavioral risk factor that could counteract some improvements in mood and physiology over time; however, current objective signals do not yet reflect worsening associated with this change.

Holistic assessment regarding perceived stress change
Evidence consistent with a decrease in perceived stress: large reduction in depressive symptoms (CES-D), improved objective sleep regularity, stronger circadian structure (interdaily stability and autocorrelation), and lower resting heart rate and lower aggregated hourly heart rates—together these are robust markers of reduced affective and physiological stress. Evidence consistent with increased or stable stress is weaker and mainly behavioral (reduced exercise, slightly lower self-esteem, small decrease in perceived control over sleep). Trait anxiety is unchanged. On balance, the multimodal pattern favors an overall decline or stabilization at a lower level of perceived stress relative to the prior wave rather than a worsening.

79834,3.0,"The participant’s self-report psychological measures show small-to-moderate improvements between waves. Depressive symptom scores on the CES‑D decreased by 2 points (8 → 6), and trait anxiety (STAI) declined by 4 points (37 → 33); both changes are in the direction typically interpreted as reduced symptom burden. Self‑esteem increased markedly (reported +5 points relative to the previous wave). Subjective happiness and overall health satisfaction remain essentially unchanged. Taken together, the pattern of change in these instruments favors a reduction in negative affective indicators and an increase in self‑reported resources (self‑esteem), which are commonly associated with lower perceived stress.

Objective physiological and sleep-derived signals provide complementary evidence. Resting heart rate declined by ~4 bpm (59.7 → 55.6), and the cosinor mesor declined modestly; lower resting heart rate and lower mean heart rate across many hours are consistent with reduced baseline physiological arousal or improved cardiovascular conditioning. Nighttime sleep measured by the wearable shows a reduced median duration (8 h 18 min → 7 h 34 min), but a large decrease in night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD 85 min → 32 min), indicating more consistent sleep duration across days. The participant also reports greater perceived control over sleep. These changes (more regular sleep and lower resting HR) generally support a movement toward lower physiological stress burden despite a modest reduction in average sleep duration.

There are, however, indicators that temper a uniformly positive interpretation. Intradaily variability of the heart rate rhythm increased substantially (0.5 → 0.9; Z‑score of the change large), which reflects greater fragmentation of day‑to‑day activity/rest patterns and can be associated with disrupted routines or more fragmented daily structure. Amplitude of the rhythm declined slightly and acrophase shifted earlier, and measures of interpersonal trust decreased modestly. Behavioral data show increased time in passive leisure activities (notably large increases in listening to music and television time) while physical activity and exercise frequency remained low and essentially unchanged. These signs point to increased within‑day irregularity and a shift toward sedentary coping behaviors that could offset some benefits from improved mood and lower resting HR.

Weighing the multi‑modal evidence holistically: self‑reported mood and trait anxiety improved and self‑esteem rose substantially; resting heart rate and sleep regularity improved—these are relatively strong indicators of reduced perceived stress. Against that, intradaily variability increased markedly and there was greater engagement in passive leisure and a small decline in interpersonal trust. On balance, the preponderance of psychological and physiological signals supports an overall reduction or stability (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave rather than a worsening.

47810,-3.0,"The self-report surveys show a mixed but in several respects favorable profile relative to the prior wave. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) decreased substantially (from 15 to 4; delta -11, Z-score of delta ≈ -1.08), while a simple happiness item increased markedly (+2, Z-score of delta ≈ 1.55). These changes point toward a notable reduction in recent negative affect and an increase in self-reported positive affect. In contrast, trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) rose modestly (37 → 40, Z-score delta ≈ 0.63) and self-esteem declined slightly (39 → 37). Health satisfaction also decreased (3.33 → 2.44, Z-score delta ≈ -0.87). Taken together, affective symptom indicators (depression and happiness) shifted in a direction typically associated with lower perceived stress, while stable trait indicators and global health satisfaction moved modestly in the opposite direction.

Behavioral self-report indicates several changes in social and leisure activities alongside sleep perceptions. The participant reports reduced time socializing and reduced group exercise (exercise with others fell from 1–2×/week to none), and perceived control over sleep duration decreased (moved from “somewhat disagree” to “disagree”). Leisure uses such as internet use and listening to music decreased, while reading increased from none to a small amount. Self-reported habitual weekday sleep duration remained at 6 hours, and the participant’s ideal sleep target remained 8 hours. The pattern suggests reductions in some social and recreational behaviors that could reduce buffering social support, while concurrently adopting small positive leisure shifts (reading) but feeling less control over sleep.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data show objective improvements in sleep quantity and some loss of daily regularity. Median nightly sleep duration increased by about 51 minutes (6 h 40 m → 7 h 31 m; Z-score of delta ≈ 0.85), and night-to-night variability in sleep timing decreased slightly; median sleep onset shifted later by ~15 minutes. These objective sleep gains are commonly associated with reductions in perceived stress and better mood regulation. At the same time, circadian regularity metrics based on heart rate rhythms changed in ways that suggest reduced robustness of daily structure: interdaily stability fell markedly (0.58 → 0.36; Z-score delta ≈ -1.59) and amplitude of the cosinor rhythm decreased (13.32 → 10.31; Z-score delta ≈ -1.02), while mesor (average HR) increased modestly. Resting heart rate rose by ~3.7 bpm (54.8 → 58.5), and the hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows broadly higher heart rates across many waking hours compared with the prior wave. These circadian and cardiovascular changes indicate a blunting and elevation of physiological rhythm and baseline arousal that can be consistent with increased physiological stress or changes in fitness/activity.

Weighing evidence across modalities: objective sleep duration and large reductions in depressive symptoms and increased happiness provide convergent signals consistent with decreased perceived stress. Opposing signals include increased trait anxiety, decreases in health satisfaction and social/group exercise, greater resting heart rate and an overall blunting of circadian amplitude and daily stability; these point toward increased physiological and social risk factors for higher stress. Magnitude and directional weight favor improvement in affective symptoms and sleep quantity (large CES-D drop, sizable happiness increase, nearly one hour more sleep), while physiological arousal and routine regularity changes are moderate-to-large but more ambiguous in their direct relationship to perceived stress. The provided negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change (r ≈ -0.56) also suggests participants with higher baseline PSS tended to show decreases in PSS over time, consistent with the observed improvement in mood-related measures.

Overall synthesis and directional assessment: considering the large decrease in depressive symptoms, the notable increase in self-reported happiness, and the objectively increased nightly sleep duration—balanced against modest increases in trait anxiety, losses in some social activities, reduced health satisfaction, and higher resting heart rate—I judge the net multimodal evidence to favor a decrease or stability (i.e., no net worsening) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave. The affective and sleep improvements are strong, direct indicators typically related to lower perceived stress, and they outweigh the physiological and social signals that point toward greater stress risk in this dataset.

62246,2.0,"Multimodal physiological and behavioral indicators show a consistent pattern of improved circadian regularity and autonomic recovery. Wearable-derived circadian metrics reveal substantial increases in interdaily stability (0.41 → 0.62) and 24-hour autocorrelation, both with large positive Z-score changes, indicating that the participant’s heart-rate rhythm became more consistently aligned day-to-day. Amplitude of the fitted circadian rhythm increased while mesor declined slightly; together with a modest drop in resting heart rate (54.6 → 52.8 bpm), these features suggest a stronger day–night separation of cardiovascular activity and lower basal cardiac arousal. Objectively measured sleep also improved in regularity and quantity: median nightly sleep increased by ~19 minutes toward the participant’s desired 8 hours, and both sleep-duration and sleep-start-time standard deviations decreased markedly (sleep variability down from 65 to 42 minutes; bedtime SD from 78 to 46 minutes). These wearable signals—greater rhythm stability, larger diurnal amplitude, reduced resting heart rate, and less variable and slightly longer sleep—are consistent with improved physiological regulation that is often associated with reduced perceived stress.

Self-reported psychological measures are mixed but show modest adverse shifts relative to the previous wave. Depressive symptom frequency (CES-D) increased from 4 to 8, and trait anxiety (STAI) rose from 33 to 36; both remain in low/nonclinical ranges but indicate a small upward movement in negative affective symptom reporting. Self-esteem declined (previously higher to a lower score), and the participant reported a reduced sense of control over sleep duration (from “somewhat disagree” to “disagree”). Global self-reported happiness was unchanged and health satisfaction declined only slightly. Substance use, exercise frequency, social activity, and most daily recreation habits were largely stable; some screen and internet use decreased while reading increased slightly. Taken together, subjective reports point to small increases in mood and self-evaluation concerns, but not large or clinically marked deteriorations.

Integrative interpretation weighing objective and subjective signals: the largest and most robust changes in the dataset are in the wearable-derived circadian and sleep regularity domain (large Z-score changes for interdaily stability, 24-hour autocorrelation, amplitude, and reduced sleep/wake variability). These objective improvements suggest enhanced behavioral regularity and autonomic recovery that typically correlate with reduced perceived stress. By contrast the subjective increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms and the drop in self-esteem are smaller in absolute magnitude and remain within low ranges; they signal modestly increased negative affect or reduced wellbeing but do not show the same magnitude or consistency across measures as the physiological improvements. Importantly, the participant’s reported sense of control over sleep declined, which could moderate any stress benefit from better objective sleep, but the overall pattern favors improved physiological regulation.

Evidence for worsening perceived stress (increase) rests primarily on modest upticks in self-reported depressive and trait anxiety symptoms and reduced self-esteem and perceived sleep control; these indicators are directionally consistent with greater subjective strain but are small in magnitude and remain nonclinical. Evidence for improvement or stability of perceived stress is stronger in the objective domain: notable increases in circadian regularity, increased sleep duration and substantially reduced sleep timing variability, and a lower resting heart rate point toward improved regulatory function and lower physiological stress load. Considering the relative magnitude and consistency of the wearable and sleep improvements versus the modest subjective declines, the holistic balance of evidence favors stable or decreased perceived stress rather than a clear worsening.

55424,3.0,"Summary of self-report psychological measures:
The participant shows clear increases in measures of negative affect and anxiety. Trait anxiety (STAI) rose by 8 points (57 → 65), moving to a substantially elevated level (current Z = 2.59) and representing the largest relative change among self-report scales. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) increased modestly (35 → 37) and remain high (Z = 2.62). Self-esteem declined slightly (32 → 30) and health satisfaction decreased meaningfully (4.78 → 3.89), indicating reduced perceived physical well-being. Self-reported happiness increased by one point, but this change is small relative to the rises in anxiety and depressive symptom scores. Taken together, the self-report profile points to greater internalizing symptom burden and lower health satisfaction compared with the prior wave.

Sleep and daily routine:
Objective sleep quantity improved slightly: median sleep duration increased by about 24 minutes (to ~7 h 48 min). Sleep start time shifted earlier by ~1 hour (median start moved from ~00:21 to ~23:20) and night-to-night variability remained similar. Subjective sleep latency shortened by 5 minutes. The net pattern is of somewhat longer and earlier sleep across the recording period, with no increase in variability. These sleep changes are plausibly protective or neutral in relation to perceived stress.

Physiological circadian metrics and aggregated heart rate:
Circadian rhythm amplitude increased (≈ +1.6 bpm) while mesor remained essentially unchanged, and acrophase shifted modestly later (about 34 minutes). Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation decreased slightly. Resting heart rate remained stable (≈57 bpm). The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows substantially higher mean heart rates in the late afternoon/early evening in the current wave (notably 4–6 pm: current ~105 and ~100 bpm vs prior ~85–89 bpm), an increase of roughly 15–20 bpm at those times. This pattern indicates greater late-day physiological arousal or exertion relative to the prior wave while baseline cardiac tone (resting HR, mesor) stayed similar.

Behavioral lifestyle context:
Daily activities and substance use are largely stable or show small changes. Exercise with others remains frequent and unchanged (protective social/behavioral engagement), exercise alone unchanged, and recreational substance use unchanged. Internet use decreased and reading increased slightly. These behavioral stabilizers may mitigate stress risk but do not offset the marked increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and directionality for perceived stress:
The strongest signals relevant to perceived stress are the substantial increase in trait anxiety and the elevated depressive symptom burden; both measures are positively associated with PSS change in the provided correlations. Physiological data add convergent evidence of increased arousal in the late afternoon/early evening (large increases in aggregated hourly heart rate), which aligns with higher stress-related autonomic activation despite stable resting HR. Protective signs (slightly longer, earlier sleep; continued social exercise; some increase in self-reported happiness) are present but appear smaller in magnitude relative to the worsening anxiety/depressive indices and the late-day heart-rate elevations. Because the most salient multimodal indicators of psychological distress and physiological arousal have increased, the preponderance of evidence supports an overall increase in perceived stress relative to the prior data collection wave.

23576,-5.0,"Psychological self-report measures show several converging signals of improved affective state alongside one notable decrement in self-evaluation. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) both decreased (CES-D −2 points; STAI −3 points) relative to the prior wave, with both current Z-scores below the sample mean; these changes point toward reduced negative affect and anxiety proneness. Self-reported happiness increased substantially (+2 points; Z-change ≈ +1.55), and health satisfaction rose modestly, supporting an interpretation of improved subjective well-being. In contrast, Rosenberg self-esteem declined by 5 points (a sizable Z-change of −0.9), indicating a meaningful reduction in global self-evaluative appraisal that could countervail some elements of improved mood. Taken together, mood and anxiety indicators lean toward improvement, while self-esteem represents a salient adverse change.

Behavioral habits and daily social/activity patterns present a mixed picture. Exercise frequency is maintained or improved: exercising alone remains frequent and group exercise increased (increase in “exercised with others” frequency), which is typically associated with better stress management and social support. Recreational screen behaviors increased (video games and internet use each rose by one category), and time socializing with friends declined by one category; increased solitary sedentary leisure and reduced in-person social time could reduce stress-buffering opportunities despite greater organized exercise. Substance use remained absent. Overall, the activity pattern suggests preserved or enhanced structured physical activity paired with increased solitary screen-based leisure and somewhat reduced casual social contact.

Objective sleep and circadian/physiological metrics indicate modest shifts without large destabilization. Median nighttime sleep measured by the wearable decreased slightly (~18 minutes) and self-reported normal weekday sleep decreased by one hour, with a concurrent reduction in perceived control over sleep duration; these subjective reductions in sleep quantity and control are risk factors for higher perceived stress. Nighttime sleep start time is slightly later (~13 minutes) and night-to-night variability is essentially unchanged. Circadian summary metrics are largely stable: mesor nearly unchanged, amplitude increased modestly, intradaily variability decreased (less fragmentation), interdaily stability declined slightly, and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased. Resting heart rate fell from 57.5 to 55.6 bpm, which generally signals lower tonic physiological arousal or improved cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregated heart rate profiles show some reallocation of daytime peaks (notably higher mean in the early afternoon relative to the previous aggregation) but no clear pattern of sustained elevation across the day. Overall, physiological and circadian indicators are consistent with preserved circadian structure and slightly lower resting arousal, while subjective sleep quantity and perceived sleep control worsened.

Weighing the multimodal evidence for change in perceived stress: indicators consistent with a reduction in perceived stress include decreased depressive and anxiety symptom scores, a substantial increase in self-reported happiness, improved health satisfaction, increased group exercise, and a lower resting heart rate. Indicators consistent with increased perceived stress or vulnerability include decreased self-esteem, reductions in self-reported weekday sleep and perceived control over sleep duration, increased solitary screen time, and reduced casual socializing. Many of the strongest, directionally consistent signals (CES-D, STAI, happiness, resting HR, exercise) point toward improvement, whereas the largest adverse single signal is the decline in self-esteem and the subjective sleep reduction. Given the balance of affective symptom improvement, behavioral engagement in exercise, and reduced resting physiological arousal, the preponderance of evidence supports a net reduction or stabilization toward lower perceived stress compared with the prior wave, despite some domain-specific declines.

42137,-8.0,"Multimodal psychological symptom summary:
Self-report affective and trait measures show substantial improvements relative to the previous wave. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) fell markedly from 15.0 to 4.0 (Delta = -11, Z-Score of Delta = -1.08), and trait anxiety (STAI) declined from 42.0 to 34.0 (Delta = -8, Z-Score of Delta = -0.78). Self-esteem increased by 3 points to a near-maximum score (40.0), and reported happiness rose from 3 to 5 (Z-Score of Delta = 1.55). These changes are large in magnitude and point toward lower negative affect and greater positive affect and self-evaluation at the current timepoint.

Sleep — subjective versus objective signals:
Objective sleep from the wearable is broadly stable-to-improved: median nightly sleep increased slightly (7 h 18 m → 7 h 32 m; +14 minutes) and night-to-night variability decreased (SD 90 m → 62 m), consistent with more consistent total sleep time. By contrast, self-reported normal weekday sleep duration decreased (7.0 h → 6.0 h) and the participant reports less perceived control over sleep duration (shift from “Somewhat Agree” to “Somewhat Disagree,” a notable negative change). Sleep onset time shifted later by only ~6 minutes median but start-time variability increased. In sum, objective sleep quantity and variability show modest improvement, while subjective perception of sleep sufficiency and control has worsened — a mismatch that can reflect altered appraisal of sleep or situational constraints despite more stable recorded sleep.

Cardiovascular and circadian indicators:
Resting heart rate and circadian rhythm features indicate reduced tonic physiological arousal and modest reorganization of daily rhythm. Resting HR decreased from 51.8 to 48.6 bpm (Delta = -3.2 bpm, Z-Score ~ -0.64), and MESOR decreased accordingly. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm rose slightly and the acrophase shifted earlier (peak moved from ~3:34 PM to ~2:16 PM), suggesting a modest advancement of the heart-rate daily peak. Intradaily variability decreased (less fragmentation) while interdaily stability declined (less consistency across days). Aggregated hourly heart rates show lower nighttime and many daytime values compared with the prior wave (notably large decreases at some afternoon hours), compatible with lower average cardiovascular activation. Overall, physiological data largely reflect reduced baseline arousal and somewhat more consolidated within-day patterns alongside less rigid day-to-day regularity.

Behavioral lifestyle signals:
Reported social and leisure patterns shifted: socializing time increased, time spent watching videos and other sedentary hobbies dropped markedly, and internet use decreased. Exercise frequency when done alone remained high; group-based exercise and sports frequency decreased. Substance use shows initiation/uptick in occasional beer consumption (from none to 1–2x/month). BMI decreased slightly. These changes are mixed: increases in socializing and sustained solitary exercise may support improved mood, whereas reduced structured social exercise and a small increase in alcohol use and reduced engagement in some previously enjoyed sedentary hobbies could reflect lifestyle trade-offs or shifting coping strategies.

Integration with perceived stress:
The large and consistent reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, increases in self-esteem and happiness, lower resting heart rate, reduced sleep variability, and increased social time collectively indicate improved affective state and lower physiological arousal relative to the previous wave. Countervailing signals include a subjective sense of less control over sleep, reduced interdaily stability (less consistent day-to-day schedule), and a small rise in alcohol consumption; these could sustain or contribute to situational stress for this individual but are smaller in scope relative to the pronounced mood improvements. The initial PSS value (25.0, Z = 0.92) combined with the observed reductions in negative affect and physiological arousal suggests a net move away from the elevated stress state measured earlier. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports a decrease or stabilization at a lower level of perceived stress rather than a worsening.

69057,-10.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report affective and psychosocial measures:
The participant shows a mixed pattern across self-report instruments with several indicators pointing toward reduced negative affect but notable declines in self-regard and interpersonal trust. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) declined from 12 to 7, and trait anxiety (STAI) decreased from 53 to 49; both changes are modest-to-moderate and directionally consistent with reduced distress. Self-reported happiness increased by one point. In contrast, Rosenberg self‑esteem fell substantially (35 to 27), and interpersonal trust declined (2.5 to 2.0). Health satisfaction rose slightly. The net pattern in the affective domain is therefore heterogeneous: mood- and anxiety-related symptom scores moved toward improvement, but self‑esteem and social-trust measures worsened, suggesting improved momentary mood/affective symptoms alongside reduced perceived social resources or self-worth.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep experience:
Objective sleep quantity improved: median nightly sleep increased by about 33 minutes (from ~5 h 35 m to ~6 h 8 m) and sleep duration variability decreased, indicating somewhat more consistent total sleep. Median sleep start time advanced by ~41 minutes (earlier bedtime), while self‑reported sleep latency increased slightly (+5 minutes) but remained near typical values. The participant continues to report low perceived control over sleep duration. Overall, wearable and subjective sleep changes are consistent with modestly improved sleep quantity and reduced night-to-night variability, which would generally be expected to support lower perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics:
Heart-rate–based circadian structure shows weakening of day–night differentiation and a marked phase shift. Amplitude decreased substantially (9.01 → 6.58) and MESOR is low relative to the sample; intradaily variability increased slightly and interdaily stability declined modestly. The cosinor acrophase shifted earlier (previously late afternoon/evening ≈ 6:18 PM to early afternoon ≈ 2:24 PM), indicating a phase advance in the heart-rate rhythm. Resting heart rate remained low and changed minimally. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles reflect lower late-evening/night heart rates and larger relative morning peaks in the current epoch compared with the previous epoch. Collectively these wearable signals indicate a flatter, less robust circadian rhythm with an earlier daily peak and slightly more fragmentation — a pattern that can reflect altered daily timing/routines despite overall preserved low resting cardiovascular tone.

Health behaviors and daily activities:
Substance-related behaviors increased: frequency of beer and wine/liquor consumption increased from monthly to weekly, and recreational drug use increased from <monthly to monthly. Exercise performed alone remained frequent and stable, but group exercise frequency declined. Several sedentary hobbies (e.g., one labeled sedentary hobby) decreased. Internet use decreased slightly and time spent on video games increased from none to minimal. BMI increased by ~1.2 points. These changes indicate greater alcohol and recreational drug exposure and reduced social exercise, which are potential risk factors for stress or poorer coping even as some leisure behaviors (listening to music, socializing time) remained stable and solitary exercise stayed high.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress (PSS):
Several objective and subjective features would be expected to coincide with reduced perceived stress: lower depressive symptom score, lower trait-anxiety score, increased sleep duration and reduced sleep variability, increased happiness, and improved health satisfaction. Conversely, notable adverse signals include a large drop in self‑esteem, declines in interpersonal trust, increased alcohol and recreational-drug use, reduced social exercise, and a blunted circadian amplitude with slightly greater rhythm fragmentation. The magnitudes of change in mood/anxiety measures and sleep quantity are moderate and directionally consistent with lower perceived stress, while declines in self-esteem and increases in substance use represent countervailing risks. Correlations provided for individual deltas with PSS change are generally small, and no single metric dominantly predicts the PSS trajectory. Considering the balance of evidence — stronger and consistent improvements in depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, sleep duration, and self-reported happiness versus isolated but important negative changes in self‑esteem, trust, and substance use — the overall multimodal profile is more consistent with a net decrease or stability (rather than a clear increase) in perceived stress since the prior wave.

64232,-4.0,"Self-report psychological measures show modest improvement since the previous wave. Depressive symptom score (CES-D) declined by 1 point and trait anxiety (STAI) declined by 1 point; both changes are small but move in a favorable direction. Self-esteem increased by 2 points and a single-item happiness rating rose substantially (+2 points, large Z of the change), while self-rated health satisfaction increased slightly. The participant’s initial PSS was high (27, Z = 1.47), and the negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change suggests those with higher initial stress in the sample tended to show reductions; together with the pattern of improved mood, these self-report indices point toward reduced perceived stress or improved affective state.

Behavioral and social activity patterns largely support the same conclusion. The participant reports increased socializing (an extra hour) and reading, reduced frequency of beer consumption (from weekly to monthly), and increased frequency of exercising with others. Internet use decreased slightly. These shifts indicate greater social engagement and some reductions in potentially stress-related substance use, both of which are typically associated with improved coping or lower perceived stress.

Sleep shows clear objective and subjective improvement. Self-reported normal weekday sleep increased from 6.5 to 8.0 hours, and wearable-derived median nightly sleep increased by 55 minutes to a high value (8 h 55 m). Variability in sleep duration and in sleep-start time decreased markedly (sleep duration SD fell by 83 minutes; sleep-start SD fell by 107 minutes), indicating more consistent and longer sleep. Sleep latency shortened from 30 to 20 minutes and the participant reports slightly greater perceived control over sleep duration. These convergent gains in sleep quantity and regularity are commonly associated with decreased perceived stress and better mood.

Physiological/circadian metrics present a mixed picture. Resting heart rate rose by 3.5 bpm (56 → 59.5), a modest increase that can reflect multiple influences (fitness, transient arousal, measurement context). Cosinor-derived amplitude decreased substantially (12.25 → 8.36; Z-change ≈ -1.32), and interdaily stability declined (0.39 → 0.29; Z ≈ -1.38), suggesting the participant’s heart-rate rhythm has lower day–night amplitude and less between-day regularity. Intradaily variability increased slightly (0.52 → 0.61), indicating somewhat greater fragmentation within days. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show elevated evening peaks (notably at 9–10 pm) relative to nighttime lows, which could reflect later-evening arousal even though median sleep start time remained similar. In summary, while sleep quantity and consistency improved, some aspects of circadian robustness and heart-rate amplitude weakened and resting heart rate increased modestly; these physiological signals could reflect residual physiological arousal or changes in activity/timing that do not fully align with subjective improvements.

Integration and interpretation: the preponderance of evidence from self-report mood measures, increased social activity, reductions in some substance use, and marked improvements in both objective and subjective sleep strongly favor a decrease in perceived stress since the prior wave. The physiological circadian signals (lower amplitude, reduced interdaily stability, slight increase in resting HR and intradaily variability) qualify this picture and suggest incomplete recovery of physiological rhythm robustness or some change in daily structure, but these objective drawbacks are smaller in magnitude relative to the clear gains in mood, sleep, and social behavior. Correlations of individual deltas with PSS change are small and many in the expected directions; the negative correlation of baseline PSS with change further supports movement toward lower perceived stress for this participant. Taken holistically, the evidence indicates that the participant’s perceived stress has most likely decreased or at least remained stable rather than worsened.

37404,-6.0,"Multimodal summary and physiological profile:
Cardiovascular and wearable-derived markers show a clear downward shift in mean cardiovascular activation across the aggregated day: resting heart rate fell from 64.6 to 58.4 bpm (Δ = -6.2 bpm; Z-change ≈ -1.27) and the hourly mean heart rates are generally lower across both daytime and nighttime hours compared with the prior wave. The mesor (mean of the fitted circadian rhythm) decreased (74.51 → 70.33; Z-change ≈ -0.68), while rhythm amplitude remains low in the population (current amplitude Z ≈ -1.95) though it increased modestly from the prior value. Taken together, the lower resting heart rate and lower hourly heart rates suggest reduced tonic physiological arousal or improved cardiovascular recovery on average; however, circadian structure around heart rate has weakened (see circadian metrics below), limiting a simple interpretation of this lower arousal as uniformly positive.

Sleep timing, variability, and circadian regularity:
Median sleep duration increased modestly (≈23 minutes longer; from ~7:09 to ~7:32; Z-change ≈ 0.31), and median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 47 minutes (00:48 → 00:01). These central tendencies would typically be viewed as small improvements. Crucially, however, variability in sleep increased dramatically: sleep duration SD rose from 66 to 181 minutes (Z-change ≈ +2.81) and sleep start time SD rose similarly (Z-change ≈ +2.10). Wearable circadian metrics show low interdaily stability (current 0.19, Z ≈ -2.24) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours, indicating weakened day-to-day regularity in physiological rhythms. Intradaily variability decreased from a previously high value (0.81 → 0.49; Z-change ≈ -2.49), but the prominent increases in between-day irregularity and sleep timing inconsistency indicate substantially more erratic sleep patterns despite small gains in median duration.

Behavioral and social changes:
Self-reported social and activity behaviors shifted toward less social engagement and somewhat reduced planned exercise. Time spent socializing dropped from a non-zero value to “do not do” (Δ Num = -3, Z-change ≈ -2.11), and frequency of exercising alone decreased (one-category drop). Alcohol consumption declined (beer and wine/liquor frequency decreased), which may reflect reduced social activity rather than a direct stress-related improvement. Sedentary hobby time increased slightly. The pronounced reduction in socializing is notable given its potential impact on perceived stress and social support.

Self-report psychological states:
Self-reported affective measures present a mixed picture. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) is unchanged and low (7 → 7). Trait anxiety (STAI) rose modestly (35 → 37; Z-change ≈ +0.5) but remains in a non-clinical range. Self-esteem increased to a high value (38 → 40; Z-change ≈ +0.39), which may be protective. Importantly, health satisfaction fell substantially (4.44 → 2.78; Z-change ≈ -1.59), indicating a sizeable decline in subjective health appraisal. Self-reported happiness is unchanged and below average (3.0). Trust increased slightly. The substantial drop in perceived health satisfaction stands out as a negative subjective change that often relates to increased perceived stress.

Weighing evidence for change in perceived stress:
Evidence consistent with increased perceived stress includes: a marked reduction in socializing (large negative Z-change), a substantial drop in health satisfaction (large negative Z-change), increased trait anxiety (small upward change), and a major increase in sleep irregularity and circadian instability (large positive Z-changes for variability; interdaily stability very low). Those features—reduced social engagement and perceived health, less stable sleep/circadian rhythms, and small rises in anxiety—are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Evidence consistent with decreased or stable stress includes lower resting heart rate and lower hourly heart rates (which can indicate lower physiological arousal), a small increase in median sleep duration, and higher self-esteem. However, the physiological reductions in heart rate occur alongside markedly worse sleep regularity and social withdrawal; given that the subjective measures most strongly tied to perceived stress (health satisfaction, social engagement, sleep regularity, trait anxiety) moved in directions associated with higher stress, the preponderance of psychologically salient signals points toward worsening perceived stress.

Conclusion:
Taken holistically, psychosocial and sleep/circadian indicators that have strong relevance to perceived stress show changes consistent with an increase in perceived stress (notably large declines in health satisfaction and social activity plus large increases in sleep irregularity and circadian instability). Physiological heart-rate reductions and small gains in median sleep duration provide some countervailing signals but are outweighed by the magnitude and psychological relevance of the negative changes. Therefore the most supported overall direction for perceived stress is an increase.

70492,-10.0,"Multimodal psychological self-report summary:
Across survey instruments, the participant shows clear and substantial reductions in self-reported mood and anxiety symptoms. The CES-D fell from 16 (previous, classified as depressed) to 5 (current, not depressed), and the STAI–Trait dropped from 49 to 39, moving from a previously elevated anxiety classification to a non-anxious range. Self-esteem increased (34 → 38) and health satisfaction rose modestly. These large decreases in depressive and trait-anxiety scores represent the most pronounced psychological changes in the dataset and indicate a marked reduction in affective symptom burden and chronic anxiety proneness between waves.

Behavioral habits and subjective well-being:
Behavioral and recreational patterns changed in mixed ways. Socializing time, music listening, and some sedentary hobbies decreased, and self-reported happiness decreased by one point, suggesting fewer leisure or pleasure activities and some reduced momentary positive affect. Alcohol use (wine or liquor) increased in frequency (1–2/month → 1–2/week) while beer consumption remained stable; non-prescribed drug use decreased to zero. Exercise frequency shows small increases for solitary exercise and sports. The participant also reports greater perceived control over sleep duration (from “Disagree” to “Somewhat Agree”), which aligns with improvements in self-esteem and health satisfaction but contrasts with the drop in reported happiness and reduced social/leisure engagement.

Sleep patterns (self-report and wearable):
Objective sleep timing became more regular while overall nightly duration declined slightly. Median sleep start time remains late (around 03:00) but variability in sleep start time and in nightly duration both decreased substantially (sleep start SD fell from 138 to 51 minutes; duration SD from 222 to 140 minutes), indicating greater consistency across nights. Median sleep duration reduced modestly (≈21 minutes). Self-reported normal weekday sleep remains short (5 hours). Thus, sleep regularity improved, but total sleep remains well below recommended durations, a pattern that has mixed implications for perceived stress and daytime functioning.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics:
Circadian summary measures show increased overall mean level of heart rate (MESOR increased by ~8 bpm, Z-Score of delta large) and a moderate increase in amplitude; resting heart rate rose by ~5 bpm. Intradaily variability declined (less within-day fragmentation) while interdaily stability declined (less consistency across days). Aggregated hourly heart rates are higher across many daytime and some nighttime hours relative to the previous wave. These changes together indicate a higher baseline cardiovascular tone and greater daily heart rate magnitude despite some improvements in rhythm regularity within days. Elevated resting and mean heart rates can reflect increased physiological arousal, recent behavioral factors (e.g., alcohol, caffeine, activity), or changes in fitness and should be interpreted as a physiological signal that is not fully concordant with the large improvements seen in self-reported mood and anxiety.

Weighing convergent and divergent signals relative to perceived stress:
Evidence consistent with reduced perceived stress includes the large, clinically meaningful declines in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, increases in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and consolidation of sleep timing (reduced variability) and some increases in exercise. These indicators are directly relevant to stress perception and coping and point toward improvement. Contrasting evidence includes increased resting and mean heart rate, higher aggregated hourly heart rates, a modest increase in alcohol frequency, and a decline in self-reported happiness and social/leisure engagement. The elevated cardiac metrics suggest greater physiological arousal that could reflect transient stressors, lifestyle factors, or nonspecific physiological change; however, the magnitude and consistency of the mental-health improvements (CES-D and STAI reductions) are the dominant signals in the psychosocial domain. Taken holistically, the multimodal pattern is mixed but weighted toward improved psychological symptomatology and perceived control despite some physiological markers of increased arousal and reductions in pleasurable social activities.

Overall assessment of change in perceived stress:
Balancing the strong reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom scales, improved self-esteem and perceived sleep control, and greater sleep regularity against the increases in resting/mean heart rate and reduced happiness/social time, the preponderance of evidence supports a decrease or stability (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave. The psychological self-report measures—most proximal to perceived stress—show substantive improvement that outweighs the physiological signal of increased heart rate, which may reflect non-stress-related factors or a decoupling between subjective stress and autonomic tone in this individual.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
95543,-1.0,"Multimodal psychological profile — self-report. Compared with the prior wave, the participant shows substantial increases in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms: Trait anxiety (STAI) rose markedly from 23 to 42 (delta Z = 2.68) and is now in the ""anxious"" range, while the CES-D increased from 1 to 10 (delta Z = 1.13), remaining below common clinical thresholds but indicating a clear rise in symptom reporting. Concurrently, self-esteem declined (49 → 43; delta Z = -1.09) and self-reported happiness fell (5 → 3; delta Z = -1.80). Health satisfaction decreased (6.0 → 4.78; delta Z ≈ -1.18). These directional changes in mood, anxiety proneness, and self-appraisal are large relative to the study population and converge on increased internal distress and lowered well-being since the previous assessment.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes. The participant reports reduced engagement in active forms of exercise (exercising with others and sports both decreased by one frequency category) while sedentary hobbies and playing video games increased; time spent listening to music rose substantially. Socializing time remained stable. Alcohol and drug use remain absent. The pattern suggests reduced physical-activity-based outlets and increased passive or solitary leisure. These behavioral shifts — less frequent group exercise and more sedentary, home-based activities — are plausibly related to changes in mood and anxiety and are consistent with behavioral correlates of increased perceived stress.

Objective sleep and circadian regularity. Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate a modest but meaningful deterioration in nocturnal sleep: median nightly sleep shortened by ~40 minutes (from ~7h25m to ~6h45m) and median sleep start shifted later by approximately 30 minutes (02:25 → 02:55). Night-to-night variability in both sleep duration and sleep start increased (SD of duration +16 min; SD of start +18 min), indicating less regular sleep timing. Subjective sleep latency remained very short (5 minutes) and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration, but objective indicators point to shorter and less regular sleep overall — a pattern frequently associated with increased perceived stress.

Cardiovascular circadian rhythms and autonomic indicators. Summary heart-rate circadian features show reduced rhythmicity and amplitude: MESOR decreased modestly (82.16 → 75.51; delta Z ≈ -1.22) and circadian amplitude fell substantially (12.81 → 6.40; delta Z ≈ -2.17), while interdaily stability declined markedly (0.60 → 0.32; delta Z ≈ -2.03). Autocorrelation at 24 hours and other regularity metrics also decreased. Aggregated hourly heart rates show a blunting of previously higher evening peaks and overall flattening across the day; resting heart rate rose slightly (65.8 → 66.6 bpm). The pattern — lower amplitude and stability of heart-rate rhythms with slightly higher resting HR — indicates diminished daily physiological modulation and greater circadian irregularity, which is consistent with stress-related dysregulation or disrupted routines.

Integrated interpretation. Multiple independent modalities converge toward an overall deterioration: large increases in trait anxiety and moderate increases in depressive symptoms, declines in self-esteem and happiness, reduced physical activity and more sedentary leisure, shorter and later sleep with increased sleep variability, and blunted circadian heart-rate amplitude and stability. A minority of signals could be protective or compensatory (no substance use, stable socializing, increased listening to music, and reported increased control over sleep), but these appear insufficient to counterbalance the magnitude and consistency of negative changes across psychological measures, behavior, sleep, and physiological rhythms. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence supports an increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

Evidence supporting worsening (increase) in PSS: substantial rise in trait anxiety (STAI delta Z = 2.68), increases in depressive symptom reporting (CES-D delta Z = 1.13), declines in self-esteem and happiness (delta Zs ≈ -1.09 and -1.80), reduced exercise frequency, shorter and later sleep with greater variability, and marked reductions in circadian regularity and amplitude (interdaily stability delta Z ≈ -2.03; amplitude delta Z ≈ -2.17) — all known correlates of higher perceived stress.

Evidence supporting stability or improvement: no increase in substance use, socializing time remained stable, and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep and increased engagement with music (possible coping). Resting heart rate change was small. These signals provide limited counter-evidence but are smaller in magnitude and fewer in number than indicators pointing to worsening.

Holistic conclusion. Considering the large-magnitude increases in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, the declines in subjective well-being and activity-based coping (reduced exercise), the objective shortening and destabilization of sleep, and the pronounced loss of circadian heart-rate amplitude and stability, the preponderance of multimodal evidence indicates an increase in perceived stress since the prior data collection.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
92566,-1.0,"Psychological self-report shows mixed but directionally concerning signals. Trait measures of mood and affect have shifted modestly toward greater negative affect: the CES-D increased by 1 point (still in the non-depressed range) and the STAI–Trait rose by 5 points (remaining classified as ""not anxious"" but with a notable positive delta). Self-esteem increased marginally, and general health satisfaction is slightly higher; however, the participant’s single-item happiness rating declined substantially (from 5 to 3), a large relative change (Z-score of the delta ≈ -1.8) that indicates a meaningful drop in momentary well-being. These self-report changes collectively suggest an increase in low-grade emotional distress or dissatisfaction despite some preserved trait-level resources (self-esteem, health satisfaction).

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep control have changed in a pattern commonly linked to elevated perceived stress. Objective Fitbit metrics show a reduction in median nightly sleep (≈29 minutes less) and a large delay in median sleep start time (≈1.5 hours later), with sleep duration already low in absolute terms (median ≈5 h 48 min; Z ≈ -1.76). Subjective weekday sleep reports mirror this pattern (reported normal weekday sleep down from 6 to 5 hours) and the participant reports less control over sleep duration than previously. These changes — shorter sleep, later and more delayed sleep timing, and decreased perceived control — are established behavioral correlates of increased perceived stress and impaired recovery capacity.

Daily activities and coping-related behaviors have shifted in ways that may reflect greater stress-related behaviors. The participant reports increased frequency of beer use (from monthly to weekly) and a notable increase in passive/in-home activities: internet use rose from 16–30 minutes to 1–2 hours, and engagement in a sedentary hobby emerged where previously there was none. Socializing time decreased by about an hour. Exercise frequency (alone) remains high and stable, which could be a protective factor, but the pattern of increased alcohol use, greater solitary/online time, and reduced social contact is consistent with behavioral responses that often accompany rises in everyday stress.

Wearable physiology and circadian rhythm metrics present a mixed but overall stress-consistent physiological signal. Circadian regularity increased: interdaily stability rose substantially (delta Z ≈ +2.04), and amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm increased markedly (delta Z ≈ +1.82), indicating stronger day–night contrast in HR. Resting heart rate increased modestly (≈2.1 bpm), and aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show pronounced elevations in daytime/afternoon heart rate (especially early to mid-afternoon) relative to the prior period. Together, these findings suggest greater daytime physiological arousal and stronger amplitude of the circadian HR rhythm; increased daytime HR and elevated resting HR are physiologically consistent with greater allostatic load or sympathetic activation even when daily timing becomes more regular.

Integrated interpretation and direction of change in perceived stress: weighing the evidence, more indicators point toward an increase in perceived stress than toward improvement. Key contributors to this conclusion are the decline in self-reported happiness, increases in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (small but directionally consistent), decreased sleep duration and later sleep timing with reduced perceived control, increases in alcohol use and solitary/online behaviors, and physiological signs of greater daytime cardiovascular arousal. Countervailing signals — improved interdaily stability, increased circadian amplitude, stable exercise frequency, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction — are present but do not outweigh the constellation of behavioral, affective, sleep, and physiological changes that align with increased stress. Correlations provided with PSS-change are generally small to moderate and do not negate the broad pattern observed. Overall, the balance of multimodal evidence indicates a worsening (increase) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

67608,-3.0,"The self-report survey data reflect generally stable to modestly improved psychological and lifestyle indicators. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased slightly from 26 to 24 (Z-score change small), and depressive symptoms (CES-D) remain very low despite a 1-point increase; self-esteem and self-reported happiness are stable at relatively high values. Health satisfaction increased by 0.67 points with a positive Z-score change, and the participant reports modestly more time socializing. Alcohol use of wine/liquor shows a notable reduction in frequency while beer use is unchanged. Taken together, these self-report changes point toward either stability or modest improvement in subjective well-being and health-related behaviors rather than a pattern of worsening psychological distress.

Objective sleep metrics show a mixed pattern. Median nightly sleep decreased from about 7 h 12 min to 6 h 31 min (approximately a 41-minute reduction) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased; sleep start times shifted later with greater variability. In contrast, subjective sleep latency improved substantially (reported falling asleep faster: 18 min previously to 5 min now), and the participant reports a small improvement in perceived control over sleep. The reduction in total sleep and increased variability are changes that can be associated with greater perceived stress, but the faster sleep onset and slightly improved perceived control suggest lower pre-sleep arousal. Overall, sleep changes are mixed and could exert competing influences on perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian measures indicate clearer improvements in daily regulation and lower physiological arousal. Interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased, intradaily variability decreased, and circadian amplitude increased; these changes reflect more regular and stronger daily heart rate rhythms across the recording period. Resting heart rate decreased by about 4.6 beats per minute (from 53.6 to 49.0), with a corresponding lower population Z-score; lower resting HR and reduced HR fragmentation are commonly associated with improved autonomic regulation and lower chronic physiological stress. Aggregated hourly heart rates show a generally lower profile relative to the previous wave at several daytime hours, supporting reduced tonic cardiovascular activation.

Activity and behavioral habits present a largely neutral-to-positive pattern with a few declines. Frequency of exercising alone remains high and unchanged, while organized sports participation decreased (from more frequent to less frequent), which may reduce an avenue of physical/social engagement. Internet use decreased and social time increased slightly. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use remain negligible. The overall behavioral pattern—reduced liquor consumption, maintained exercise frequency, increased socializing, and decreased internet time—leans toward healthier lifestyle practices that would be expected to support stable or reduced perceived stress.

Weighing the multimodal evidence: physiological indicators (lower resting heart rate, greater circadian regularity, reduced intradaily variability) and self-report indicators (lower trait anxiety, higher health satisfaction, reduced liquor use, stable high happiness and self-esteem) point toward decreased or stable perceived stress. The main countervailing signal is shorter and more variable objective sleep, which can elevate stress; however, improved sleep latency and perceived control mitigate that concern. The initial PSS score (21) is moderately elevated and shows a negative correlation with change, consistent with regression toward lower scores. On balance, the evidence supports stability or modest improvement in perceived stress rather than worsening.

50766,1.0,"Multimodal self-report profile: On self-report measures of mood and trait affect, the participant shows modest improvements in depressive and anxiety symptom scales alongside a decline in self-esteem. The CES-D score decreased from 11 to 8 (delta -3; Z-score change ≈ -0.20), moving further into the ""not depressed"" range, and the STAI–Trait score dropped from 37 to 35 (delta -2; Z-score change ~ -0.01). In contrast, Rosenberg self-esteem declined by 3 points (43 → 40; Z-change ≈ -0.53), and interpersonal trust decreased slightly (3.0 → 2.83; Z-change ≈ -0.51). Self-reported happiness remained unchanged. Health satisfaction remained high and stable. These self-report shifts point to modest reductions in reported depressive and anxiety symptoms but a concurrent small decline in self-regard and interpersonal trust.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals: Objective circadian regularity derived from heart-rate rhythms shows pronounced deterioration. Interdaily stability dropped substantially (0.68 → 0.37; delta Z ≈ -2.25) and 24-hour autocorrelation declined markedly (0.57 → 0.27; delta Z ≈ -2.13). Circadian amplitude also decreased notably (18.41 → 10.38; delta Z ≈ -2.72), while mesor changed only modestly. Resting heart rate remained essentially unchanged (57.2 bpm), but aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles indicate a relative elevation of nocturnal heart rates (higher means across the 12–4 AM hours compared with the previous wave) and a redistribution of daytime peaks (less extreme afternoon/evening spikes than previously). Taken together, the wearable metrics indicate a sizable loss of 24-hour rhythm robustness and some increase in nocturnal cardiovascular activation despite stable resting HR.

Sleep, routine, and behavioral changes: Sleep duration was effectively stable with a small increase in median nightly sleep (≈ +8 minutes) and little change in overall sleep-duration variability. However, sleep timing became later and less consistent: median sleep start shifted about 11 minutes later (01:27 → 01:39) and start-time variability increased substantially (SD ~54 → 76 minutes). The participant also reported less perceived control over sleep duration (from ""Agree"" to ""Somewhat Agree""). Behavioral patterns shifted toward more episodic, solitary, and irregular activities: exercise with others remained frequent (three+ times/week) but solo exercise declined to none, time spent video gaming increased from none to ~31 minutes, and passive/creative leisure (music listening, sedentary hobbies, reading) decreased. Alcohol use by wine or liquor increased slightly. These behavioral shifts—later, more variable sleep timing, reduced routine, and increased evening screen/gaming time—are consistent with the objective reductions in circadian regularity.

Integration of signals in relation to perceived stress (PSS): The self-report mental health indices (CES-D, STAI) provide evidence of modest symptomatic improvement in low-frequency negative affect and anxiety proneness, which would tend to predict decreased perceived stress. Health satisfaction and resting heart rate are stable, supporting a lack of large-scale worsening in overall subjective health. Conversely, the objective circadian disruption (large declines in interdaily stability, 24-hour autocorrelation, and amplitude) and increased variability in sleep timing provide strong physiological and behavioral evidence of disrupted daily structure and increased nocturnal activation—patterns that are typically associated with elevated physiological stress load or dysregulated recovery. Several of these objective changes have relatively large effect sizes (Z-change ≲ -2), making them salient despite small or improving subjective symptom scores. Correlations between individual metric changes and PSS-change in the dataset are generally small; notably, the participant’s initial PSS (19) is below the sample mean and is negatively correlated with subsequent PSS change in the cohort (correlation -0.56), suggesting some regression toward decreased PSS for participants starting at similar levels.

Holistic assessment of direction of perceived stress change: Balancing the sources, self-reported mood and anxiety symptoms show small improvements while objective circadian stability and sleep-timing consistency deteriorate considerably. Because perceived stress as measured by PSS is a subjective appraisal, changes in self-reported affective measures (CES-D, STAI) and stable health satisfaction provide direct evidence that perceived stress is at least not worsening and may have decreased. The marked loss of circadian regularity and increased nocturnal cardiovascular activation are important signals of physiological strain but do not unambiguously indicate increased subjective perceived stress in this participant given the concurrent improvements in reported depressive and anxiety symptoms. On balance, the preponderance of evidence favors stability or a modest decrease in perceived stress rather than a clear increase.

71089,2.0,"Multimodal summary of mood and trait measures: Self-report mood and trait indicators show consistent improvement between waves. The CES-D score decreased by 4 points (16 → 12), moving from a classification of ""Depressed"" to ""Not depressed."" Trait anxiety (STAI) declined by 6 points (46 → 40), and global self-esteem increased by 6 points (27 → 33). Health satisfaction rose by more than one point on the 1–7 scale. These changes are of a magnitude that is clinically meaningful at the individual level and point toward reduced negative affect and improved self-evaluative functioning across domains relevant to perceived stress. Correlations provided for individual deltas are small to modest and do not contradict this interpretation.

Sleep: subjective and objective sleep indicators diverge. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep decreased by roughly 45 minutes (8h12 → 7h26) and the median sleep-start time shifted about 50 minutes later (00:50 → 01:40). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start time increased modestly. Self-reported weekday sleep duration likewise decreased (7 → 6 hours), sleep latency increased slightly (10 → 15 minutes), and the participant reported a marked loss of perceived control over sleep duration (from ""Somewhat Agree"" to ""Disagree""). Taken together, objective sleep quantity remains within a reasonable range for many adults but has decreased and become later and somewhat more variable, and the participant’s subjective experience of poorer/less-controlled sleep has worsened — a pattern that can negatively affect day-to-day coping and perceived stress even when other domains improve.

Behavioral habits and activities: Several lifestyle factors suggest increased passive, potentially stress-perpetuating behaviors. Frequency of beer and wine/liquor consumption increased from monthly to weekly (one category change), and time spent in sedentary hobbies rose substantially (from 1–2 hours to >4 hours per day). Exercise frequency remained at zero across both waves. Socializing hours were unchanged. These behavioral shifts (greater alcohol use and sedentary time, no change in exercise) represent potential risk factors for elevated stress or attenuated stress recovery, though the dataset’s correlations for these deltas with PSS change are small and do not strongly implicate them as primary drivers of PSS change on their own.

Physiological and circadian metrics: Wearable-derived cardiovascular and rhythm indices show a notable reduction in physiological arousal and modest improvements in circadian regularity. Resting heart rate decreased about 4.8 bpm (71.2 → 66.4), and the cosinor MESOR fell by ~8.4 bpm, reflecting a lower average heart rate across the day. Hourly aggregated heart rates are lower across most daytime hours compared with the previous recording, with especially large reductions in previous midday/afternoon peaks. Nonparametric circadian metrics indicate improved structure: interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation increased while intradaily variability decreased slightly. The acrophase shifted later by ~30 minutes. Collectively, these patterns are consistent with reduced tonic cardiovascular activation and more stable daily organization of physiology, which typically aligns with reduced chronic physiological stress load.

Integrated interpretation and balance of evidence: Multiple independent sources converge toward reduced stress-related burden: marked decreases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, increases in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and lower resting and daytime heart rates combined with improved circadian regularity all favor an improvement in perceived stress since the prior wave. Offsetting influences include objective decreases in sleep duration, later and slightly more variable sleep timing, markedly reduced perceived control over sleep, increased alcohol use, and increased sedentary leisure time — factors that could sustain or aggravate perceived stress in the longer term. However, the magnitude and consistency of mood and physiological improvements are broader and more coherent than the negative changes in sleep and lifestyle, and the provided delta correlations are generally small and do not strongly favor a net worsening. On balance, the integrated multimodal evidence supports a net decrease or stabilization (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior data collection.

22688,-3.0,"Self-report measures show a mixed psychosocial profile: depressive symptoms (CES-D) remain very low and unchanged, but there is a notable decline in momentary well-being with the single-item happiness score falling from 5 to 3 (Z-change ≈ -1.8), and a small increase in trait anxiety (STAI trait +3 points, Z-change ≈ 0.63) alongside a modest drop in self-esteem (-2 points). Trust and health-satisfaction remain positive and stable. The large decline in self-reported happiness is the most salient subjective change and is consistent with increased negative affect or reduced positive affect since the prior wave; the modest rise in trait anxiety provides secondary support for increased perceived distress, although trait anxiety remains low in absolute terms.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes contain both protective and potentially stress-related elements. The participant substantially increased organized physical activity (sports frequency increased markedly and exercise with others remained high), and social engagement appears greater (socializing moved from ~30 minutes to 1–2 hours). Alcohol and drug use are unchanged and low-to-moderate. These increases in social and physical activity are typically protective against stress and could mitigate perceived stress. Conversely, sedentary hobby time increased and time spent gaming decreased; these leisure-pattern shifts are neutral to ambiguous with respect to stress. Overall the behavioral signal is mixed but leans toward increased active coping (more exercise and social contact), which would generally support stress reduction.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics present a complex picture. Resting heart rate and the cosinor MESOR both decreased (resting HR down ~3.2 bpm; MESOR down ~6.3 bpm), and aggregated hourly heart rate values are lower across many daytime hours compared with the previous collection—changes that commonly reflect reduced tonic cardiovascular arousal or improved fitness. However, circadian regularity metrics show weakening of rhythm stability: autocorrelation at 24 hours declined sharply (0.28 → 0.09), interdaily stability remains low, and intradaily variability increased modestly. The combination of lower baseline cardiac activity with substantially reduced day-to-day circadian coherence suggests lower average physiological arousal but greater disruption of daily structure; pronounced evening heart-rate peaks (notably a higher 7–8pm value in the current period) further indicate altered timing of physiological activation. Taken together, the physiology suggests reduced tonic arousal but increased circadian and temporal irregularity—an ambivalent physiological profile with potential implications for perceived stress.

Sleep shows moderate deterioration in objective timing and regularity despite overall duration remaining within a reasonable range. Median nightly sleep measured by the wearable decreased by ~32 minutes (from ~8h02m to ~7h30m), sleep start shifted earlier by ~30 minutes, and night-to-night variability in sleep timing increased (sleep start SD increased). Self-reported “normal weekday” sleep remains reported as 6 hours and subjective perceived control over sleep is unchanged and low; sleep latency increased slightly but remains short. The modest reduction in objective sleep duration combined with greater variability in timing and persistent low perceived control over sleep are consistent with factors that can heighten perceived stress or reduce resilience to stressors.

Integrative interpretation and net direction for perceived stress: evidence is mixed but leans toward an increase in perceived stress. The strongest indicators of worsening perceived stress are the pronounced decline in self-reported happiness and the meaningful loss of circadian regularity (large drop in 24-h autocorrelation and increased intraday variability), both of which are more directly associated with greater perceived stress and poorer mood. Small rises in trait anxiety and small decreases in self-esteem add to that signal. Offsetting this are objective signs typically associated with lower stress—reduced resting heart rate and lower MESOR—and increases in exercise and social interaction, which are protective. Sleep shows modest worsening in variability and duration, which supports the stress-increase interpretation. Considering the relative magnitude and psychological relevance of the happiness decline and circadian disruption versus physiological improvements, the balance of multimodal evidence indicates a net worsening of perceived stress since the prior assessment.

38815,-2.0,"Over the two-year interval the participant’s self-report measures show clear improvement on core affective dimensions that are closely related to perceived stress. The CES-D score fell markedly (11 → 2; delta −9), and the STAI–Trait score also declined substantially (43 → 35; delta −8), with the STAI classification moving from “anxious” to “not anxious.” Self-esteem increased slightly (38 → 39). These changes are sizeable in absolute terms and in z-score change, and the documented positive correlations between CES-D/STAI change and PSS change indicate that reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety should be expected to associate with reductions in perceived stress. Academic performance (GPA) remains high. Taken together, the self-report mental-health signal points strongly toward decreased perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

Sleep subjectively and by duration shows improvement in some respects but also changes in timing that are mixed. The participant reports their normal weekday sleep duration increasing by about 1 hour (6 → 7 hours) and sleep latency declining from 35 to 20 minutes, both suggesting improved sleep quantity and ease of sleep initiation. Fitbit median sleep duration is essentially stable to slightly increased (≈7 h 3 m → 7 h 9 m), while night-to-night variability in sleep duration decreased substantially (SD 136 min → 57 min), indicating more consistent sleep amounts. However, sleep timing shifted later (median sleep start delayed by ~55 minutes) and the variability of sleep start times increased markedly (SD of start time rose from 67 to 172 minutes). These timing changes (later and more irregular bedtimes) can be disadvantageous for circadian alignment even when total sleep time is adequate. Correlations provided indicate that the increase in nightly duration and reductions in latency are weakly associated with decreased PSS, while the delayed and more variable sleep timing has a small association in the opposite direction. On balance, the sleep quantity signal favors reduced perceived stress, whereas the later and more irregular timing is a competing negative influence.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals are mixed and require careful interpretation. Circadian regularity metrics show modest improvements: interdaily stability increased (0.33 → 0.41) and intradaily variability decreased slightly (0.60 → 0.58), which reflect somewhat more consistent day-to-day patterns of heart-rate activity. Cosinor-derived mesor increased slightly and amplitude decreased, indicating a modest elevation in average heart-rate with attenuated day–night range. The most notable physiological change is an increase in resting heart rate (45 → 52.6 bpm; Δ +7.6 bpm), a large relative change with a high delta z-score. Hourly aggregated heart-rate patterns show elevated daytime heart rates at several hours and differences in evening peaks compared with the prior wave. An elevated resting heart rate can reflect increased autonomic arousal, reduced cardiovascular fitness, recent illness, or other physiological stressors; in isolation it would suggest increased physiological strain. Correlations of these wearable deltas with PSS change are generally small or inconsistent, so the physiological data provide a mixed signal—circadian regularity moving slightly toward greater consistency, but a notable rise in resting heart rate and altered timing that are potential markers of increased physiological stress.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are also mixed but generally support either stability or modest improvement in psychosocial functioning. Recreational and social activities show increases in some leisure behaviors (listening to music increased substantially; video game time increased), exercise alone remains frequent and participation in sports increased (from none to 1–2 times/month), while internet usage declined. Alcohol consumption (beer) increased (from 1–2×/week to three times a week or more), and self-rated health satisfaction and single-item happiness ratings declined slightly. The increases in exercise and reduction in sedentary internet time, together with large reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, would be expected to coincide with lower perceived stress; conversely, increased alcohol use, reduced health satisfaction, and lower self-rated happiness are signals that could push perceived stress in the opposite direction.

Weighing the evidence holistically: the most robust and directionally relevant changes are the substantial decreases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety and improved sleep quantity and consistency, each of which is associated (by the provided correlations and by their magnitudes) with reduced perceived stress. Offsetting signals include a marked increase in resting heart rate, later and more variable sleep timing, increased alcohol use, and slight declines in happiness and health satisfaction; these are important but generally smaller in magnitude or have weaker documented correlations with PSS change in this dataset. The initial PSS value (22) and its negative correlation with change (−0.56) also predict a tendency toward reduction in PSS for someone starting at a higher value. Integrating self-report and wearable evidence, the preponderance of changes supports a net decrease or stability-with-decrease in perceived stress rather than a worsening.

71193,-12.0,"The self-report psychological measures show substantial and consistent improvement between waves. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D) fell markedly from 39 to 18, and trait anxiety (STAI) decreased from 60 to 41, both large changes that move the participant toward lower symptom burden. Self-esteem increased from 28 to 40, reaching the upper range of that scale, and single-item indices of happiness and interpersonal trust are higher than previously. Health satisfaction also rose appreciably. These changes are large in magnitude (Z-score changes >2 for some scales) and converge on improved affective and self-related functioning, which are closely related to perceptions of stress and to capacity for coping with daily demands.

Sleep-related data present a mixed but mostly positive picture. Objective median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (~25 minutes) and subjective normal weekday sleep increased from 6 to 7 hours; sleep latency decreased by about 10 minutes and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration. Sleep start time shifted earlier by roughly 34 minutes. Increased sleep quantity and shorter latency, together with greater perceived sleep control, are generally supportive of reduced perceived stress. However, nocturnal regularity decreased: night-to-night variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time rose substantially (notable increases in standard deviation), indicating more irregular sleep timing despite increased average duration. The net sleep signal therefore suggests improved sleep opportunity but less consistency across nights.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian metrics likewise provide a nuanced pattern. Resting heart rate changed only slightly (≈ +1.4 bpm) while aggregated hourly heart rate shows lower afternoon/evening peaks in the current wave compared with the prior wave; this pattern is consistent with reduced daytime physiological activation on average. Cosinor-derived MESOR and amplitude decreased slightly, and non-parametric circadian measures show a notable decline in interdaily stability and an increase in intradaily variability (greater fragmentation of daily heart rate patterns). Together, these indicate a weakening of stable daily rhythmicity and greater within-day fluctuation in activity/physiology, which can be associated with greater physiological dysregulation even when mean levels move in a favorable direction.

Behavioral activities show several supportive changes and one notable area of potential concern. The participant reports no substance use across waves and increased engagement in reading; socializing is unchanged. Positive lifestyle signals include improved self-reported health satisfaction and reductions in BMI. Conversely, frequency of exercising alone declined from occasional to none, representing a loss of a potentially stress-mitigating behavior. Taken together with the circadian fragmentation and increased sleep variability, this suggests that although subjective mood and sleep quantity improved, some components of daily behavioral structure (exercise, regularity) have weakened.

Balancing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most clinically relevant signals point toward decreased perceived stress: large reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, marked increases in self-esteem and health satisfaction, more sleep on average, and lower daytime heart rate peaks. Offsetting signals—loss of exercise, increased variability in sleep timing, and reduced circadian stability—suggest areas of persistent or emerging vulnerability but do not outweigh the magnitude and convergence of the psychological and many physiological improvements. On balance, the pattern of change is consistent with an overall decrease or stability at a lower level of perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

71985,-4.0,"Multimodal affective and trait profile:
Self-report affective and trait measures show a pattern of improved mood-related symptomatology alongside mixed signals in broad well-being indices. The depressive symptom score (CES-D) fell markedly from 14 to 6 (large negative delta, Z-score change -0.75), and trait anxiety (STAI) declined from 41 to 36; both changes indicate appreciable reductions in core symptoms commonly associated with stress. Rosenberg self-esteem increased from 34 to 38, consistent with greater perceived self-worth. In contrast, single-item reports of happiness and interpersonal trust declined modestly (happiness 4→3; trust 3.5→3.17), suggesting some attenuation in momentary positive affect and interpersonal confidence despite the larger reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Overall, the strongest and most consistent signals in the self-report domain point toward reduced internalizing symptoms and greater self-esteem.

Sleep timing, duration and circadian structure:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate a meaningful shift in sleep timing and duration. Median sleep start moved later by about two hours (00:21 → 02:21), and median nightly sleep duration decreased by ~35 minutes (7h18m → 6h43m). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start times decreased (SDs dropped substantially), indicating more consistent but later and shorter sleep. Circadian rhythm summary metrics show reduced interdaily stability and a lower 24-hour autocorrelation, while acrophase shifted later (about a 20-minute later peak in heart rate) and amplitude decreased slightly; intradaily variability remained essentially unchanged. Physiologically, aggregated hourly heart rate shows elevated mean heart rates overnight and into the early morning relative to the previous wave, and resting heart rate increased minimally (50.2→50.8 bpm). Together these data suggest a delayed sleep schedule with shorter total sleep, reduced day-to-day variability but weakened overall circadian robustness and some increase in nocturnal/early-morning physiological arousal.

Behavioral activity, social and lifestyle factors:
Activity and daily habit data show reductions in planned physical activity and social exercise: frequency of exercising alone declined (from ~3–4 sessions to ~1–2 weekly) and exercising with others dropped to none. Recreational patterns shifted toward more screen-based leisure (video game time increased by one categorical level) while socializing time remained stable. Substance use remained absent. Health satisfaction inched upward slightly and BMI increased marginally. These changes indicate less structured, lower-frequency physical activity and increased sedentary/recreational screen time, with interpersonal social time largely unchanged.

Integration relative to perceived stress (PSS):
Several converging indicators are consistent with a reduction in stress-related symptomatology: the large drop in depressive symptoms, the decrease in trait anxiety, and the increase in self-esteem are robust psychological signals that typically accompany reductions in perceived stress. The initial PSS anchor (score = 23) and its moderate negative correlation with change (r ≈ -0.56) are consistent with regression toward lower scores among participants with higher baseline stress; this statistical tendency supports the possibility of PSS improvement here. Offsetting risk factors for higher perceived stress include shorter sleep duration, a two-hour delayed sleep schedule, reduced exercise frequency, reduced interdaily circadian stability, and modest increases in nocturnal heart rate—each of which can contribute to elevated stress or physiological strain if persistent. However, many of the correlations between specific metric changes and PSS change are small in magnitude in this dataset.

Holistic judgment:
Weighting the relative magnitude and psychological relevance of the observed changes, the pronounced improvements in depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and self-esteem are the most salient and psychometrically meaningful signals related to perceived stress. The negative effects from shorter, later sleep and reduced exercise are important but of smaller overall magnitude in the psychological measures and have weaker correlations with PSS change in this dataset. Taken together, the preponderance of evidence supports an overall decrease or stability (not an increase) in perceived stress relative to the previous wave.

98117,2.0,"The self-report psychological measures indicate a net worsening in affective and anxiety-related domains between waves. Trait anxiety (STAI) increased markedly from 53 to 66 (Δ = +13; Z-Score of Δ = 1.91), moving the participant further into the anxious range. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) remained high and unchanged at 33, consistent with an elevated depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem fell substantially from 32 to 19 (Δ = -13; Z-Score of Δ = -2.39), and a simple happiness item declined from 2 to 1. These shifts (large increase in trait anxiety, large decrease in self-esteem, decreased self-reported happiness with persistently elevated depressive symptoms) point to deterioration in subjective emotional functioning that is commonly associated with increased perceived stress.

Sleep-related data present a mixed but largely stability-oriented pattern. Self-reported normal weekday sleep duration rose from 3.0 to 5.5 hours (a large reported increase), and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep and a higher ideal sleep target. Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a modest reduction in median nightly sleep (from 6h37m to 6h16m, Δ = -21m) but substantially reduced variability in both duration (SD down by 82 minutes) and sleep-start timing (SD down by 173 minutes), and an earlier median sleep onset (shift ~1h8m earlier). In sum, objective sleep became more regular and temporally consolidated even as median duration declined slightly; the participant also reports improved perceived control over sleep. These changes suggest improved sleep regularity but not a clear increase in total nightly sleep time.

Physiological and circadian measures show greater circadian regularity paired with elevated daytime cardiovascular activity. Nonparametric and cosinor-derived indices of circadian structure increased: interdaily stability rose from 0.27 to 0.60 (Z-Score of Δ = 2.48), 24-hour autocorrelation increased, and amplitude increased markedly (7.12 → 12.69). Mesor was essentially unchanged. Aggregated hourly heart rates show higher mean heart rate across much of the daytime (notably early afternoon peaks ~92–95 bpm vs prior ~85–86 bpm), while early-morning hourly heart rates are slightly lower; resting heart rate changed minimally (67.2 → 66.4). The pattern—stronger, more stable circadian rhythmicity alongside higher daytime mean heart rates—is consistent with a more structured daily routine but also elevated daytime physiological arousal, which can accompany increased stress or anxiety.

Behavioral habit changes are mixed and provide modest context. Internet use decreased substantially (from >4 hours to 1–2 hours), and the participant reports a small increase in solitary exercise frequency. However, time spent in sedentary hobbies increased (from 16–30 minutes to ~2–3 hours), socializing remained minimal, and substance use remained absent. Academic performance shows a gradual decline across listed terms. Taken together, the behavior data show less online engagement and more regular daily patterning, but also increased sedentary leisure and limited social engagement.

Holistic interpretation and direction of perceived stress change: affective and anxiety self-report indicators show clear worsening (large STAI increase, marked decline in self-esteem, lower happiness) and persistent high depressive symptoms, which strongly point toward an increase in perceived stress. Physiological data provide corroborating evidence of increased daytime arousal (higher daytime hourly heart rates) despite improvements in sleep regularity and circadian consolidation; these mixed patterns suggest that improved routine has not translated into improved subjective emotional state. Behavioral changes (reduced internet use, increased sedentary hobby, low social contact) do not offset the pronounced negative shifts in anxiety and self-concept. Considering the relative magnitudes and the domains most closely tied to perceived stress, the preponderance of evidence supports an overall increase in perceived stress.

24883,3.0,"Multimodal psychological profile — self-report measures:
Compared with the prior wave, self-reported mood and trait anxiety show small improvements: CES-D decreased by 2 points (from 9 to 7) and STAI–Trait decreased by 2 points (from 42 to 40). Self-esteem increased modestly and the participant reports greater interpersonal trust and higher momentary happiness relative to the previous assessment. These shifts point to slightly lower depressive symptom burden and modestly improved affective self-evaluations. In contrast, general health satisfaction declined modestly, and the participant reports a marked loss of perceived control over sleep duration. Taken together, self-report signals present a mixed picture with modest psychological gains (mood, anxiety, esteem, trust) co-occurring with decreased perceived physical health control.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes:
There is a clear reduction in social, recreational, and physical-activity behaviors relative to the previous wave. Frequency of exercising alone declined from occasional to none; time spent socializing, watching media, and using the internet all decreased, and alcohol use moved from weekly to monthly levels. Reduction in these activities may reflect changes in routine, social engagement, or time allocation (e.g., academic demands) and represents less use of typical behavioral outlets or social supports. The pattern (less exercise, less social/recreational engagement) is notable because these behaviors commonly buffer stress; their reduction therefore increases the likelihood of greater perceived strain despite improvements in mood scores.

Sleep and sleep-related perceptions:
Both subjective and wearable-derived sleep metrics show deterioration in sleep quantity and stability. Self-reported typical weekday sleep dropped from 5 to 4 hours and desired weekday sleep decreased by an hour. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration declined by approximately 41 minutes (from ~6 h 53 m to ~6 h 12 m), while night-to-night variability increased substantially (sleep duration SD rose from 88 to 154 minutes; sleep start-time SD also increased). The participant also reports a marked decline in perceived control over sleep. These convergent objective and subjective changes—shorter average sleep, much greater variability, and less perceived control—are commonly associated with higher stress and reduced capacity to recover physiologically and psychologically between demands.

Physiological and circadian signals:
Resting heart rate increased modestly (~3 bpm), and aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles reveal higher cardiovascular levels across several daytime and early-evening hours, including a pronounced elevation in the late-afternoon period (4–5 PM). Cosinor-derived circadian features show a slightly higher MESOR and amplitude and an earlier acrophase (peak shifted from ~7:07 PM to ~6:01 PM). Interdaily stability increased (more consistency across days), while intradaily variability also rose (greater fragmentation within days). In synthesis, heart-rate metrics indicate a modest upward shift in baseline physiological activation together with greater within-day variability and an earlier daily peak. The combination of higher resting HR, greater hour-to-hour elevations, and increased sleep instability suggests increased physiological arousal and reduced overnight recovery capacity.

Holistic integration and implications for perceived stress:
The dataset contains mixed but convergent signals. Self-report affective measures (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, self-esteem, happiness, and trust) trend slightly in a favorable direction, indicating some improvement in mood and social valuation. However, objective physiological markers (increased resting HR and elevated daytime/evening heart rates), materially worse sleep quantity and stability, reduced physical activity and social/recreational engagement, and a loss of perceived control over sleep provide substantive evidence of greater allostatic load and fewer behavioral coping resources. Because perceived stress is sensitive to both subjective coping/resources and physiological recovery, the strong and consistent deterioration in sleep, decrease in health-related behaviors, increases in physiological activation, and diminished perceived control over sleep weigh more heavily as indicators of increased perceived stress than the small improvements in mood/anxiety scores. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors an overall increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
66815,-2.0,"The participant’s self-report psychological measures show a pattern of improvement on several clinically relevant dimensions between waves. Depressive symptom scores on the CES-D decreased substantially (11 → 5), and trait anxiety on the STAI also decreased (41 → 37), with both moves corresponding to better classification or lower symptom burden. Self-esteem remained stable at a relatively high level, and overall satisfaction with physical health increased markedly (4 → 6). One exception within self-report affect is a notable drop in a single-item happiness rating (5 → 3), indicating lower momentary subjective happiness despite improvements on depressive and anxiety scales. Taken together, the multi-item instruments that typically map onto chronic negative affect and vulnerability (CES-D, STAI) point toward improvement, while the single-item happiness score suggests a more mixed or transient change in positive affect.

Behavioral self-reports indicate shifts that are plausibly stress-buffering. The participant reports a large increase in solitary exercise frequency (from rare to three times per week or more) and greater participation in sports; socializing and low-intensity leisure (listening to music, reading) also increased modestly. Alcohol use increased from “not at all” to about 1–2 times per month for beer and wine; recreational and non-prescribed drug use remain absent. Sleep-related self-report metrics (typical weekday duration ~7 hours, stable control over sleep) were stable in quantity and perceived control, while sleep latency increased modestly by a few minutes but remains in a low range. These behavioral changes (more regular physical activity, modestly increased social/recreational engagement) are consistent with actions that commonly reduce perceived stress, although the small rise in alcohol consumption is a potential countervailing factor.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show improved timing and greater circadian regularity. Median sleep duration increased slightly (by ~9 minutes) and the median sleep start time shifted earlier by almost two hours (01:49 → 23:49), indicating an earlier and more stable bedtime pattern. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of the heart-rate-derived rhythm increased, intradaily variability decreased slightly, and the amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm rose substantially. These changes indicate stronger, more consolidated day–night structure in physiological activity. Resting heart rate decreased (46.0 → 43.4 bpm), and the hourly aggregated heart rate profile shows lower nocturnal heart rates with clearer daytime peaks compared with the prior wave. Collectively, these physiological patterns are consistent with improved autonomic balance or cardiovascular fitness and stronger circadian entrainment, both of which are commonly associated with lower perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and implications for perceived stress: multiple independent modalities point toward reduced stress-related burden. Improvements in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, increased health satisfaction, higher exercise frequency, earlier and more regular sleep timing, stronger circadian rhythmicity, and a lower resting heart rate converge toward an overall pattern of better physiological regulation and adaptive behaviors. The principal discordant findings are a drop in a single-item happiness rating and a small increase in occasional alcohol use; these are noteworthy but smaller in magnitude and less consistent across domains than the improvements described above. The participant’s initial PSS score (22) was modestly elevated; given the direction and magnitude of improvements across validated symptom scales and objective wearable markers, the balance of evidence indicates a reduction or stabilization-to-improvement in perceived stress between waves.

14847,6.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological summary:
Objective wearable-derived metrics show clear improvements in sleep quantity and daily rhythmicity. Median nightly sleep duration increased substantially (approximately +1 hour 30 minutes, from ~6h38m to ~8h08m) with a reduction in night-to-night variability (sleep SD down ~35 minutes). Self-reported sleep latency also improved (45 → 20 minutes) and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration. Circadian measures derived from heart rate indicate greater regularity (interdaily stability up from 0.33 to 0.46; autocorrelation at 24 h increased) and reduced fragmentation (intradaily variability decreased markedly), together with an earlier circadian peak (acrophase advanced by ≈1 hour). Resting heart rate and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile are largely similar to prior values with a modest downward shift in mean cardiac level (mesor down ~5 bpm), consistent with lower overall cardiovascular activation overnight and across parts of the day.

Self-report psychological and behavioral measures show a contrasting pattern of worsening mood and behavioral engagement. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) rose markedly (24 → 40, Δ = +16), and trait anxiety (STAI) increased substantially (50 → 60, Δ = +10); both changes are large relative to the study population and are directionally consistent with increased internal distress. Self-rated happiness declined (4 → 3) while global health satisfaction decreased slightly. Concurrent behavioral changes that typically buffer stress are reduced: frequency of exercise declined sharply (from ~three times/week or more to 1–2 times/month), time spent socializing declined, and listening to music and other leisure engagements diminished. Substance use shows no meaningful change. Self-esteem increased slightly, and interpersonal trust increased, but these changes are small relative to the increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Integrative interpretation of discordant signals:
The dataset thus presents a divergence between objective physiological/behavioral recovery-like signals (longer, more regular sleep and stronger circadian regularity; lower intraday variability) and subjective reports indicating substantially worsened mood and anxiety and reduced social and physical activity. This pattern is consistent with a scenario in which sleep quantity and circadian regularity improved—perhaps due to reduced evening social activity, more time in bed, or a more regular schedule—but these objective gains did not translate into improved affect or perceived coping. The large increases in CES-D and STAI, and the decreases in socializing and exercise (both with known links to perceived stress), weigh strongly toward an increase in internal distress and perceived burden. Correlational indicators provided in the dataset (positive correlations of CES-D and STAI changes with PSS change) further support the relevance of the mood/anxiety increases to perceived stress.

Assessment of overall change in perceived stress:
Evidence for increased perceived stress: substantial increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, decreased social and exercise engagement, reduced self-reported happiness, and small declines in health satisfaction—all of which are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Evidence for decreased or stable perceived stress: objective sleep and circadian stability improved markedly, which could reduce physiological stress load; resting heart rate is steady to slightly lower. Holistically, the pronounced and clinically meaningful worsening in affective symptomatology and loss of behavioral coping resources (exercise, socializing) are more directly tied to perceived stress than the improvements in sleep regularity alone. Therefore the balance of evidence indicates an overall increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
99733,-3.0,"Sleep and sleep-related self-report show the largest and most consistent change across modalities. Objective Fitbit sleep increased substantially: median nightly sleep rose from 6 h 43 m to 8 h 05 m (Δ ≈ +1 h 22 m) while night-to-night variability decreased (SD 86 → 47 minutes). Sleep onset shifted slightly earlier (median start ~00:38 → 00:05) and start-time variability declined. These objective improvements are mirrored in self-report: normal weekday sleep duration and ideal weekday sleep time both increased to 8 hours, and the participant endorsed stronger perceived control over sleep. The pattern of longer, more regular sleep with greater subjective control is typically associated with reduced perceived stress and improved capacity for daytime coping.

Circadian and activity-regularity metrics reinforce a shift toward greater temporal organization. Interdaily stability rose from 0.42 to 0.60 and 24-hour autocorrelation increased, indicating stronger day-to-day regularity in heart rate patterns; amplitude and mesor of the fitted rhythm also increased modestly. Intradaily variability remained essentially unchanged. Together these changes suggest a more consolidated, higher-amplitude circadian signal and improved behavioral regularity (consistent sleep/wake and activity timing), which commonly accompany reductions in chronic stress or improved behavioral regulation.

Physiological cardiac measures show mixed signals. Resting heart rate increased from 61.3 to 65.4 bpm (Δ ≈ +4.1 bpm) and the fitted MESOR rose by ~3 bpm; aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher daytime means in the current period compared with the prior period, particularly mid-morning and early afternoon. An elevated resting heart rate and higher daytime heart-rate means can reflect increased physiological arousal, recent changes in fitness, or shifts in daily activity. However, intradaily heart-rate fragmentation did not increase and circadian regularity improved, reducing the likelihood that the elevated heart rate reflects poorer sleep consolidation or chaotic activity patterns. Importantly, the provided correlations between these heart-rate deltas and PSS change are close to zero, indicating limited direct evidence tying the heart-rate increase to worsening perceived stress in this dataset.

Self-report measures of affect and psychosocial functioning are stable to improved. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) remained low and unchanged (score = 5), trait anxiety (STAI) decreased slightly (31 → 30), self-esteem increased modestly (33 → 34), and happiness and trust showed notable increases (happiness 3 → 4; trust 3.33 → 4.5). Health satisfaction rose by one point. The participant reports minimal substance use and modest solitary exercise frequency unchanged; socializing time increased slightly. These shifts—greater positive affect, higher interpersonal trust, improved self-esteem and health satisfaction—align with improved subjective well-being and generally correspond to reductions in perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and balance of evidence. The strongest and most coherent signals point toward improved behavioral regulation and subjective well-being: markedly increased and more regular sleep, stronger circadian stability, and increases in positive affect, trust, and health satisfaction. These changes form a consistent pattern that is typically associated with reductions in perceived stress. The main counterpoint is an increase in resting heart rate and higher daytime heart-rate means, which could reflect greater daytime activity or transient physiological arousal; however, circadian regularity improved and correlations linking heart-rate changes to PSS change are negligible in the provided data. The participant’s initial PSS was 18 (z ≈ -0.98), indicating a below-average baseline stress level; given the array of sleep, circadian, and psychosocial improvements observed since the prior wave, the preponderance of evidence supports an overall stable or decreased level of perceived stress rather than a worsening.

27407,1.0,"The participant’s self-reported psychological measures show small, mostly favorable or stable changes relative to the prior wave. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D decreased by 1 point (13 → 12), and trait anxiety on the STAI decreased by 1 point (50 → 49) but remains elevated relative to the sample (STAI Z ≈ 0.94). Self-esteem is unchanged. The initial PSS score of 23 (Z = 0.38) provides a moderate-to-high anchor for perceived stress; the dataset notes a moderate negative correlation (−0.56) between initial PSS and subsequent change, suggesting some regression toward lower scores among participants who began higher, but this is an association for interpretation rather than a direct measurement of this participant’s trajectory.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are mixed, with some improvements and some deteriorations. Objective and subjective sleep duration moved modestly in a positive direction: median wearable sleep increased by about 19 minutes (6h14 → 6h34) and the participant’s normal weekday sleep duration increased from 5.5 to 6.0 hours. However, sleep timing shifted later (median sleep start delayed by ~42 minutes to about 02:45) and night-to-night variability of sleep start increased, while the participant reported a stronger sense of lack of control over sleep duration (moved from “Disagree” to “Strongly Disagree”). Exercise done alone increased in frequency (from ~1–2×/week to ≥3×/week), which is typically protective, whereas group exercise decreased and sedentary hobby time increased substantially (an increase in sedentary pastime frequency). Alcohol consumption rose (beer frequency increased from monthly to weekly), while recreational drug use remained absent. These behavioral changes therefore present a heterogeneous picture: modest gains in sleep quantity and solo exercise counterbalanced by later/less-regular sleep timing, more sedentary leisure, and increased alcohol use.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics point toward increased nocturnal physiological activation and reduced circadian regularity. Intradaily variability increased markedly (0.51 → 0.66), with interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation showing small declines, indicating more fragmented and less-consistent day-to-day rhythms. The cosinor-derived mesor (average heart rate) rose modestly (64.55 → 67.11) and resting heart rate increased slightly (47.1 → 48.2 bpm), though absolute RHR remains low relative to the sample. Aggregated hourly heart rates show higher values overnight and in late evening hours in the current period versus the previous period (e.g., elevated values around midnight–3am and in late evening), consistent with later sleep timing and potential nocturnal arousal. Amplitude decreased slightly. Collectively, these patterns indicate a shift toward later and more variable sleep-wake timing with increased within-day fragmentation and elevated nocturnal cardiovascular tone.

Integrative interpretation for perceived stress change: evidence for worsening perceived stress includes later and more variable sleep timing, increased intradaily variability (more fragmented circadian pattern), elevated nocturnal and late-evening heart rates, increased sedentary hobby time, and greater alcohol consumption—patterns that are commonly associated with greater physiological and behavioral stress burden. Evidence for stability or improvement includes small reductions in self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms and modest increases in sleep duration and solo exercise frequency. The self-report psychological improvements are small and the STAI remains elevated; by contrast the wearable-derived indicators of circadian disruption and nocturnal physiological activation are clearer and of larger relative magnitude. On balance, the multimodal data more strongly support a net increase in physiological and behavioral stress-related indicators than a convincing reduction in perceived stress. Therefore the overall direction of change in perceived stress is assessed as an increase.

Notable positive changes include a large increase in self-rated health satisfaction (from 2.33 to 5.67; Z‑score delta = 3.03) and a meaningful increase in interpersonal trust. Self-reported weekday sleep duration increased (from 7 to 8 hours) and subjective sleep latency remained short and stable. Concurrently, some behavioral shifts could be interpreted as mixed: the participant increased solitary exercise frequency but stopped exercising with others and ceased participation in sports; socializing time decreased modestly; alcohol (beer) use rose from less-than-monthly to 1–2 times per week. These behavioral changes suggest greater engagement in individual health behaviors alongside reduced group/social activities.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics indicate clearer and stronger daily rhythmicity and lower basal physiological arousal. Measures of circadian regularity improved substantially: interdaily stability increased from 0.20 to 0.51 (Z‑score delta ≈ 2.33), 24‑hour autocorrelation rose markedly, and amplitude increased (delta Z ≈ 2.74), indicating a more pronounced daily pattern in heart rate. Acrophase shifted earlier (≈6:03 PM to 4:23 PM), suggesting an advance in the timing of peak cardiovascular activity. Intradaily variability changed minimally and mildly toward less fragmentation. The participant’s resting heart rate fell substantially (76.0 → 62.5 bpm; delta = −13.5 bpm; Z‑score delta ≈ −2.82), a large and physiologically meaningful reduction that typically corresponds to lower tonic cardiovascular activation or improved cardiovascular recovery.

Sleep monitoring corroborates subjective sleep improvements. Median wearable-recorded sleep duration increased by ~23 minutes, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration decreased (SD down ~37 minutes). Median sleep start time was essentially unchanged, though variability in start time rose; the overall pattern is slightly more sleep time and less variability in duration, coupled with greater circadian stability from heart-rate rhythms. Aggregated hourly heart rate profiles show lower nocturnal and early-morning heart rates compared with the prior period and preserved daytime peaks; this pattern aligns with a lower resting heart rate and greater amplitude of daily variation rather than a generalized elevation in arousal across the day.

Synthesis relevant to perceived stress change:
Evidence supporting a decrease or stability (improvement) in perceived stress is substantial: large objective reductions in resting heart rate and marked improvements in circadian regularity and amplitude are physiologically consistent with reduced chronic arousal or improved autonomic regulation. Subjective indicators that align with lower stress include increased health satisfaction and increased nightly sleep duration with reduced variability. Trait anxiety decreased slightly and depressive symptoms did not worsen. Countervailing signals that could reflect stress-related risk are increased solitary alcohol use and reductions in social exercise and socializing time; these social-behavioral changes could, if sustained, reduce social buffering against stress. However, the increased interpersonal trust and improved subjective health mitigate concerns about social isolation as an explanatory factor.

Overall assessment of direction of change in perceived stress:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the balance favors improved or at least stable perceived stress relative to the prior wave. Physiological markers (large drop in resting HR, stronger circadian amplitude and stability) and self-reported improvements in sleep duration and health satisfaction provide convergent, moderate-to-strong evidence for reduced tonic stress/arousal. The behavioral changes that could be adverse (less social exercise, increased beer frequency) are present but smaller in magnitude and not accompanied by worsening mood or depressive symptoms. The initial PSS was relatively high (26), and available correlations of initial PSS with change suggest a tendency for higher baseline scores to be followed by reductions; this is consistent with the observed pattern. On balance, the integrated data indicate perceived stress has likely decreased or remained stable rather than worsened.

51437,-5.0,"Self-report psychological measures show a net movement toward lower reported internal distress. Scores on the CES-D (depressive symptoms) declined from 4 to 1 and the STAI–Trait (anxiety proneness) declined from 35 to 31, both changes indicating reduced symptom burden relative to the prior wave; these are small-to-moderate changes but both move in a direction consistent with reduced negative affect. Self-esteem decreased modestly (45 to 42), an exception to the generally positive self-report pattern, and self-reported happiness remained unchanged; health satisfaction increased slightly. Taken together, the self-report profile suggests reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms with minor decreases in global self-worth, but no large shifts in subjective happiness.

Objective physiological signals from the wearable align with improved cardiovascular and sleep quantity indicators. Resting heart rate fell substantially (74.3 to 65.0 bpm; Δ = −9.3 bpm; Z-Score of the change ≈ −1.93), and the mesor of the circadian heart-rate rhythm also decreased (−8.3), consistent with lower baseline cardiovascular activation. Intradaily variability decreased (0.88 → 0.67; Z-Score of Δ ≈ −1.71), indicating less fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm within days. These changes typically reflect reduced physiological arousal and better autonomic recovery across the day. Contrastingly, interdaily stability decreased (0.34 → 0.24; Z-Score ≈ −1.81), indicating reduced regularity of the daily rhythm from day to day.

Sleep behavior shows an overall increase in objective sleep duration with concurrent increases in timing variability. Median nightly sleep from Fitbit increased by about 1 hour 10 minutes (6:15 → 7:25), a sizable improvement in sleep quantity that would be expected to support better mood and lower perceived stress. Sleep start time shifted only slightly earlier (by ~9 minutes), but the standard deviation of sleep-start times increased substantially (from 32 to 67 minutes), indicating less consistency in bedtimes. Subjective sleep reports are stable for duration, with slightly longer sleep latency and a modest decline in perceived control over sleep—suggesting that while actual sleep time improved, the participant experienced somewhat less perceived control and more variability in timing.

Daily activities and social measures point to increased social engagement and stable or improved health behaviors. Time socializing with friends increased (from ~1–2 hours to ~2–3 hours), exercise frequency when alone remained high (three times/week or more), and substance use remained low and stable. Some recreational patterns shifted (internet use increased; participation in formal sports decreased), and a previously reported sedentary hobby was discontinued. These behavioral changes—particularly more social time and consistent solo exercise—are consistent with supports for lower perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and balance of evidence: multiple independent indicators point toward reductions in physiological and psychological stress markers. Objective autonomic markers (notably the large drop in resting heart rate and reduced intraday heart-rate variability/fragmentation) and substantially increased objective sleep duration are strong, convergent signals of improved recovery and lower physiological load. Self-report depression and anxiety scores also declined. Areas of potential concern—reduced interdaily rhythm stability, greater variability in sleep timing, a modest drop in self-esteem, and reduced perceived control over sleep—suggest some destabilization in routine and subjective control, but these are smaller in magnitude relative to the improvements in sleep quantity and resting physiology. On balance, the preponderance of physiological, sleep, and symptom-report changes support an overall decrease or stabilization (improvement) in perceived stress rather than worsening.

21932,5.0,"Multimodal self-report profile: Compared with the prior wave, the participant shows small but consistent shifts on several psychological scales that point toward greater internal distress. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) increased by 3 points (from 4 to 7) and trait anxiety (STAI) increased by 3 points (from 28 to 31); both remain in low ranges but the direction is toward more symptoms. Self-esteem declined by 3 points. Subjective reports of happiness and interpersonal trust increased modestly, indicating some positive affect and social confidence at the item level, but these increases coexist with the rises in depressive and anxiety symptom scores. The initial PSS was well below the cohort mean (PSS = 13, Z = -2.34); the provided negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change (r = -0.56) suggests participants with very low baseline stress commonly show increases over time, which is relevant context for interpreting other changes.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep experience: Objective sleep from the wearable indicates a decrease in median nightly sleep duration (about 34 minutes shorter) and a marked increase in night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD rose from ~50 to ~118 minutes). Sleep onset shifted later by roughly 46 minutes and the start-time variability increased substantially. Subjective sleep latency improved (reduced by ~15 minutes) and the participant reports a small improvement in perceived control over sleep duration (moving from “strongly disagree” to “somewhat disagree”), while reported weekday sleep duration remained stable at 7 hours. Overall, objective sleep became shorter, later, and far more irregular despite slight subjective improvements in latency and perceived control — a pattern that is commonly associated with increased stress vulnerability or disrupted routines.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology: Circadian regularity metrics show modest deterioration in rhythm stability and structure: interdaily stability declined slightly and intradaily variability increased, indicating more fragmented within-day heart rate patterns. Cosinor-derived measures (MESOR, amplitude) increased slightly, and resting heart rate rose by ~2.2 bpm. Aggregated hourly heart rate shows higher daytime/evening heart rates on several hours compared with the prior wave. Taken together these physiological changes indicate a small upward shift in baseline cardiovascular activity and increased rhythm fragmentation, which are concordant with greater physiological arousal and reduced circadian consistency.

Behavioral context and lifestyle: Behavioral shifts include increased frequency of solitary exercise (now three times a week or more) while exercise with others dropped to zero; socializing time decreased slightly (from ~31 minutes to 16–30 minutes). Alcohol use (beer) increased by one frequency category. BMI rose from ~19.5 to ~21.5. The participant’s recreational screen time (TV/video) increased from none to a short daily amount. These changes point to greater solitary activity and some increased substance exposure, coupled with reduced social exercise, which could reduce social buffering of stress even as personal exercise frequency increased.

Integration and interpretation regarding perceived stress: Multiple domains converge on a pattern consistent with increased perceived stress. Psychological symptom measures (CES-D, STAI) moved upward, self-esteem moved downward, objective sleep shortened and became much more irregular with later timing, and circadian/heart rate measures show increased fragmentation and a modest rise in resting cardiovascular tone. Behavioral context — reduced social exercise and slightly reduced socializing despite increased solitary exercise — may further reduce social coping opportunities. Some contrasted signals (small increases in self-reported happiness and trust, shorter subjective sleep latency, and increased solitary exercise frequency) suggest partial resilience or compensatory behaviors, but these appear secondary to the broader pattern of worsening sleep regularity, rising internalizing symptoms, and physiological markers of increased arousal. Given the baseline low PSS and the known negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent increases, alongside the predominance of changes that correlate positively with PSS worsening (e.g., increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms, increased intradaily variability), the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress has increased relative to the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
54030,-8.0,"The participant’s self-report psychological profile shows small but directionally positive changes. Trait anxiety (STAI) decreased by 3 points (27 → 24), moving the participant further into the lower-anxiety range; depressive symptoms (CES-D) remained very low and stable; self‑esteem increased slightly and remains elevated relative to the sample (RSES delta +1, high Z-score); subjective happiness remained high and unchanged; and health satisfaction increased modestly. Taken together, these self-report signals indicate lower chronic anxiety and preserved or improved self-perceived well‑being relative to the prior wave.

Daily activities and social behaviors shifted in mixed ways that largely align with reduced stress-related risk. Socializing time remained high and stable, passive screen time decreased substantially (TV/video dropped to “do not do” and hourly internet use declined), and time spent listening to music increased. These changes suggest a reduction in passive, potentially avoidant screen behaviors and maintenance of social contact—both patterns that commonly co-occur with improved coping or lower perceived stress. Physical activity patterns changed unevenly: exercising alone rose slightly from very low levels while exercised-with-others and organized sports frequency declined. The net exercise signal is a modest reduction in group/structured activity but a small increase in solo exercise; this may reflect changed routines rather than a large negative behavioral shift.

Objective sleep and circadian indicators show a mixture of favorable and unfavorable elements. Median nightly sleep duration increased slightly (6 h 18 m → 6 h 30 m) and night-to-night variability in duration decreased substantially (SD from 143 to 96 minutes), indicating more consistent total sleep across nights. However, median sleep start time shifted later (about 23 minutes later) and start-time variability increased, so bedtimes are both later and more variable. Circadian regularity derived from heart rate improved: interdaily stability rose, intradaily variability decreased markedly, and 24-hour autocorrelation increased—together these point to stronger, less fragmented day-to-day structure in physiological rhythms, a pattern generally associated with better stress regulation.

Physiological cardiac signals present a contrasting pattern. Resting heart rate increased notably (+5.4 bpm; 56.6 → 62.0) and hourly mean heart rates are elevated across many daytime and several nighttime hours relative to the previous wave; mesor and amplitude also increased. Higher resting and mean heart rates can index greater physiological arousal, lowered cardiorespiratory fitness, or other factors (medication, illness, caffeine, etc.). This elevation in cardiovascular tone suggests increased physiological activation that is not fully aligned with the subjective and behavioral indicators of improved stress. Notably, the correlations provided between heart‑rate changes and PSS change are small, indicating weak direct association in this sample.

Weighing evidence across modalities: subjective and behavioral measures (lower trait anxiety, stable low depressive symptoms, increased self‑esteem, higher health satisfaction, reduced passive screen time, maintained social contact, and improved sleep duration regularity and circadian stability) collectively point toward reduced perceived stress relative to the prior wave. The principal counter-evidence is the substantial rise in resting and mean heart rates, which could indicate increased physiological arousal or declining fitness; this physiological signal tempers the degree of confidence but does not override the broader pattern. Additionally, the participant’s initial PSS was relatively elevated and the reported negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change suggests a tendency toward reduction from that baseline. On balance — combining strong subjective/behavioral improvements and circadian regularization with an isolated physiological elevation — the overall pattern is more consistent with stable or decreased perceived stress rather than a worsening.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
84502,-3.0,"The self-report psychological measures show several signals consistent with reduced negative affect and reduced chronic anxiety. The CES-D score decreased substantially (18 → 11), moving the participant from the “depressed” range into the non-depressed range; this is one of the largest favorable changes in the dataset. Trait anxiety (STAI) changed minimally in the direction of less anxiety (38 → 37). Self-esteem decreased slightly (41 → 39), and global happiness remained unchanged; these smaller changes temper the overall picture but do not outweigh the CES-D reduction. Interpersonal trust increased appreciably (3.67 → 4.17), which could reflect greater social confidence or perceived support. Conversely, perceived health satisfaction declined markedly (5.22 → 3.89), indicating the participant views their physical health less favorably now than previously; this change could act as a source of strain independent of mood symptom reductions.

Objective sleep and recovery-related metrics from the wearable show notable improvement in several areas relevant to stress regulation. Median nightly sleep duration increased by ~22 minutes (7h31m → 7h53m) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration decreased substantially (SD 109 → 59 minutes), indicating more consistent sleep quantity. Median sleep start time moved slightly earlier and its night-to-night variability also decreased. Resting heart rate fell (52.4 → 48.8 bpm), suggesting reduced basal cardiovascular arousal or improved cardiorespiratory fitness/recovery. Together, longer, more regular sleep and a lower resting heart rate are consistent with improved physiological recuperation and lower tonic stress load.

Circadian and heart-rate rhythm features provide a mixed but interpretable pattern. Circadian amplitude increased substantially (13.43 → 17.17, large positive Z), indicating a larger day–night difference in heart rate; MESOR shifted slightly lower. The circadian acrophase moved earlier (approx. 3:45 PM → 2:56 PM). Interdaily stability decreased (0.62 → 0.50) while intradaily variability increased (0.53 → 0.64), indicating the daily rhythm is on average stronger in amplitude but less consistently timed across days and somewhat more fragmented within days. Aggregated hourly heart rates show lower nocturnal and early-morning values and pronounced daytime/late-afternoon peaks; the overall lower resting heart rate alongside increased amplitude suggests a deeper trough with higher peaks rather than uniformly elevated cardiovascular tone. The pattern is consistent with improved baseline recovery but with some irregularity in rhythm timing across days.

Behavioral and social activity changes support coping resources that often mitigate perceived stress. Socializing time increased substantially, and exercise with others remained frequent, both of which can buffer stress through social support and regular activity. The participant reports no substance use, and reading time increased. Some leisure behaviors changed in ways that could reflect shifting routines (internet use increased, listening to music decreased, sports participation dropped). The marked increase in socializing and rise in interpersonal trust are likely protective against stress; increased internet use and loss of certain leisure (music) are smaller, mixed signals.

Weighing the evidence for change in perceived stress: indicators favor improvement or stability rather than worsening. Strong signals pointing toward reduced stress include a sizable drop in depressive symptom burden (CES-D), a small reduction in trait anxiety, increased social engagement and trust, longer and more regular objective sleep, and lower resting heart rate — all consistent with reduced tonic stress and improved recovery. Offsetting signals that could contribute to higher perceived stress include the substantial decline in health satisfaction, a slight drop in self-esteem, a reduction in perceived control over sleep duration, and reduced interdaily rhythm stability/increased intradaily fragmentation. However, those adverse signals are generally smaller in magnitude or reflect subjective appraisal of health rather than strong physiological stress markers. On balance, the preponderance of objective recovery improvements and large mood-symptom reduction suggests the participant’s perceived stress has not increased and is more consistent with stability or improvement.

25197,-7.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Relative to the prior wave, the participant reports broadly positive shifts in affective and trait-level symptom measures. Trait anxiety (STAI) declined by 8 points (Z-change ≈ -0.78) and depressive symptoms (CES-D) declined by 2 points, while self-reported happiness increased by 2 points (Z-change ≈ +1.55). Self-esteem and health satisfaction also increased modestly. These changes point to reduced subjective anxiety and depressive symptom burden and higher positive affect and perceived health since the previous measurement. One social/interpersonal signal runs counter to that pattern: interpersonal trust declined modestly and reported time spent socializing decreased; these are isolated negative direction changes amid otherwise favorable self-report shifts.

Sleep and behavioral routines:
Wearable-derived and self-reported sleep indicators show improvement and greater regularity. Median nightly sleep duration increased by about 26 minutes (from ~6 h 34 min to 7 h; positive Z-change), night-to-night variability in sleep duration decreased, sleep onset shifted earlier by ~41 minutes, and variability in sleep start times dropped. Self-reported normal weekday sleep duration and latency remained stable, though the participant felt slightly less in control of sleep duration. Daily leisure and social habits shifted: exercise frequency increased (notably exercising alone more often and more sports activity), internet use increased slightly, sedentary hobbies were reduced, and time socializing decreased. Increased exercise and more consolidated, slightly longer sleep align with improved behavioral supports for lower perceived stress, whereas reduced socializing and decreased interpersonal trust may attenuate some of those gains.

Physiological and circadian patterning:
Cardiovascular indicators suggest lower physiological arousal overall. Resting heart rate decreased from 52.0 to 48.8 bpm (Z-change ≈ -0.64), and the heart-rate MESOR declined, consistent with a lower average cardiophysiological set point. Aggregated hourly heart rates are lower across much of the day compared with the prior period, and peak hourly spikes are reduced, suggesting fewer high-arousal episodes captured by the wearable. Circadian rhythm metrics are mixed: amplitude increased slightly while interdaily stability decreased and intradaily variability increased, and autocorrelation at 24 hours lowered. In other words, the participant’s mean cardiovascular level and acute arousal events have decreased, but the day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms is somewhat reduced and within-day fragmentation is slightly higher. The physiological pattern thus predominantly indicates lowered tonic arousal with a minor trade-off in circadian regularity.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress:
Taken together, convergent evidence from self-report, sleep, activity, and physiology favors a reduction in perceived stress since the prior wave. Reductions in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, increases in happiness, better sleep duration and consistency, increased exercise, and lower resting heart rate and average heart-rate MESOR all commonly co-occur with decreases in perceived stress. Offsetting signals are modest: reduced socializing and interpersonal trust, and small increases in intradaily variability, which could reflect changes in social context or daily structure but do not outweigh the multiple, larger-magnitude indicators of improvement (notably the large z-change in happiness and the meaningful decrease in STAI). The initial PSS score (25, Z ≈ 0.92) is relatively elevated and negatively correlated with change (r = -0.56), which is consistent with larger reductions in stress for participants who started higher; the multimodal pattern is coherent with such a decrease.

Conclusion:
Overall evidence supports a decrease or stabilization toward lower perceived stress compared with the previous collection.

23270,3.0,"Psychological self-report and trait measures show a pattern consistent with reduced affective risk and greater perceived capability. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI–Trait) fell by 10 points (from 47 to 37), moving the participant from the anxious to the not-anxious classification; this is a large, clinically meaningful drop (Z-score of the delta ≈ -1.04) and, given the positive correlation between STAI change and PSS change reported in the dataset, this reduction in trait anxiety would be expected to accompany a decrease in perceived stress. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D decreased modestly (−2 points) while self‑esteem increased by 3 points to the scale ceiling (40), indicating improved self-evaluation. Global measures of happiness and health satisfaction are unchanged at relatively favorable levels. The initial PSS of 19 places the participant slightly below the study population mean (Z = −0.71); the dataset notes a negative correlation between initial PSS and subsequent change, which suggests individuals with higher initial stress tended to decrease more over time, but the participant’s initial value was not elevated, so this regression tendency is not a primary driver for this case.

Behavioral lifestyle measures indicate increased social integration and stable or increased activity that would typically protect against stress. The participant reports increased time socializing (an increase from ~16–30 minutes to 1–2 hours daily) and maintained high frequencies of exercise and sports participation (three or more times weekly). Trust scores increased slightly. Recreational substance use shows a transition from no use to low-frequency alcohol use (beer 1–2/month; wine 1–2/week), with large Z-score changes but modest absolute frequency; the direction and small magnitude of these changes provide limited evidence for stress worsening on their own. Internet use increased by about one hour per day. Taken together, increased social contact and stable high physical activity are protective factors that plausibly favor reduced perceived stress, while modest increases in alcohol use and internet time are possible countervailing influences of smaller magnitude.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics suggest improved daily regularity with modest physiological shifts. Measures of circadian organization derived from heart rate improved: interdaily stability increased substantially (Δ = +0.17, Z‑score of delta ≈ 1.3) and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (Δ = +0.27, Z‑score ≈ 1.74), while intradaily variability decreased (Δ = −0.09). These changes indicate a more regular, less fragmented circadian structure across days, a pattern commonly associated with better daytime functioning and lower subjective stress. Mesor (mean heart rate) decreased slightly and amplitude increased, consistent with a somewhat stronger day–night contrast in heart rate. Resting heart rate rose modestly by ~1.2 bpm but remains low in absolute terms (57 bpm). Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show typical daytime elevations and low nighttime values; differences versus the previous wave are small and do not indicate global physiological hyperarousal. Overall, the circadian/physiological signal favors stability or improvement in stress-related regulation.

Objective and subjective sleep metrics present mixed signals but are largely within normative ranges. Median sleep duration measured by the wearable declined by ~41 minutes (from 8 h 49 m to 8 h 8 m), and self-reported normal weekday sleep decreased from 8 to 7 hours; sleep latency increased from 20 to 35 minutes. Sleep start time became slightly earlier and markedly more consistent (reduced variability of start times and reduced SD of sleep timing). The decline in total sleep time and increase in latency are indicators that could be associated with increased strain, but absolute sleep duration remains around eight hours on average and timing regularity improved—an overall pattern suggesting modest deterioration in some sleep parameters but concurrent improvements in sleep regularity that may mitigate adverse effects. Correlations provided in the dataset between sleep change metrics and PSS change are small, indicating limited predictive weight from the sleep shifts alone.

Holistic synthesis and directional judgment: weighing multimodal evidence, the largest and most consequential changes point toward reduced perceived stress. The pronounced decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) and the increase in self-esteem are strong psychological signals favoring lower perceived stress and have nontrivial correlations with PSS change in the dataset. Behavioral patterns—more social time, sustained high exercise/sports participation, and improved circadian regularity—are additional factors that typically correspond with reductions in perceived stress. Negative indicators (moderate reductions in sleep duration, increased sleep latency, and modest increases in alcohol use) are present but of smaller magnitude and/or offset by improved sleep timing regularity and other protective behaviors. Physiological metrics do not show a pattern of sustained autonomic hyperarousal. Integrating these strands, the preponderance of evidence supports a conclusion that perceived stress has remained stable or decreased rather than increased.

67177,-5.0,"Multimodal summary and psychological self-report changes:
Across the two assessment waves the participant shows a mixed pattern of self-reported affective and behavioral changes. Depressive symptom severity (CES-D) increased by 4 points (from 16 to 20), with the score remaining in the range classified as depressed; this change has a modest positive correlation with PSS change in the dataset (Delta Correlation = 0.26). Trait anxiety (STAI) declined slightly (-2 points) while self-esteem remained effectively unchanged. Self-reported happiness increased substantially (from 2 to 4), and interpersonal trust and health satisfaction show small positive changes. Taken together, self-report affect and trait measures are heterogeneous: some indices of well-being (happiness, trust, health satisfaction) improved while depressive symptoms increased, indicating greater burden of depressive symptoms despite subjective increases in some positive affect indicators.

Sleep timing and subjective sleep versus objective sleep:
Objective sleep derived from the wearable shows a modest reduction in median nightly sleep duration (about 22 minutes shorter; 6h32m vs 6h54m previously) and a later median sleep start time (shifted ~42 minutes later). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is slightly reduced. Self-reported weekday habitual sleep duration increased by 0.5 hours relative to the previous survey (from 5.5 to 6.0 hours), while desired sleep remained stable at 7 hours and perceived control over sleep remained low. This pattern—later bedtimes and marginally shorter objectively measured sleep while the participant reports somewhat longer habitual sleep—suggests a mismatch between perception and wearable-recorded sleep timing, and a net small loss/fragmentation of restorative sleep opportunity.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics:
Cardiovascular signals show notable changes indicative of increased physiological activation. Resting heart rate rose markedly by 8.6 bpm (62.0 to 70.6 bpm; Z-Score of the change 1.86), and the cosinor mesor increased (~4.9 bpm). Aggregate hourly heart-rate profiles are elevated across many daytime and evening hours relative to the prior recording, including elevated nighttime and early-morning values, implying a higher baseline cardiovascular tone across the day. Circadian regularity metrics show decreases in measures of day-to-day rhythm stability (interdaily stability down, autocorrelation at 24 hours down substantially), while intradaily variability decreased slightly. The combination of elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian stability is consistent with increased autonomic/physiological load and a less-regular daily heart-rate rhythm over the recording period.

Behavioral habits and activity:
Reported recreational and activity behaviors changed in small ways: internet usage decreased slightly, solitary exercise increased from none to infrequent, and a sedentary hobby increased from none to 1–2 hours daily. Alcohol use shows a small uptick for wine/liquor from none to less than 1–2 times per month. BMI increased by 2.57 points. These behavioral shifts are modest in magnitude, but the increase in sedentary engagement and BMI combined with only infrequent exercise offers behavioral context that could contribute to worse physiological stress load over time.

Integrative interpretation and implications for perceived stress:
Evidence points in two directions. Indicators consistent with increased perceived stress include the rise in depressive symptoms (CES-D), the substantial increase in resting heart rate and mesor, later sleep timing with a small loss of objectively measured sleep, and reduced circadian stability—physiological and sleep-regulation changes that commonly align with greater stress burden. Contrasting signals include a reduction in trait anxiety, a notable self-reported increase in happiness, small gains in trust and health satisfaction, and modest increases in self-reported weekday sleep duration and exercise frequency; these would tend to indicate improved or stable subjective well-being. Weighing the magnitude and putative impact of changes, the physiological signal (large RHR increase and degraded circadian regularity) together with worsened depressive symptoms appear more robust and likely to accompany an increase in perceived stress. The initial PSS score (25.0) is relatively elevated and has a negative correlation with change (Correlation with change = -0.56), which suggests higher baseline stress can predict later decreases in PSS in the sample overall, but for this participant the convergent physiologic and depressive-symptom changes point toward worsening perceived stress rather than improvement.

87328,3.0,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral changes:
Compared with the prior wave, the participant shows meaningful declines in several self-reported well‑being indicators. Depressive symptom score (CES‑D) increased from 0 to 8 (Z‑score of the change ≈ +1.02), and a single‑item happiness rating declined from 5 to 3 (Z‑score of change ≈ −1.8). Health satisfaction also decreased (score delta −0.89, Z ≈ −0.87). Trait anxiety (STAI) and self‑esteem are essentially unchanged at low anxiety and high self‑esteem respectively. Substantial reductions in social and recreational engagement are apparent: socializing time decreased by ~3 hours (Z‑score of change ≈ −2.11), reading and listening to music both dropped by large amounts (Z ≈ −1.8 and −1.06). Exercise frequency when done alone increased modestly (1–2 times/week vs prior 1–2 times/month), while team/sports activity and exercising with others decreased. Overall the survey pattern indicates lower positive affect, reduced social contact, and somewhat worse perceived physical health, with only modest increases in solitary exercise.

Sleep pattern changes (subjective and wearable):
Subjective sleep control declined markedly (from “Agree” to “Disagree”; change Z ≈ −2.59) and reported normal weekday sleep duration decreased by about one hour (7.0 → 6.0 hours; change Z ≈ −1.11). Reported sleep latency improved (60 → 30 minutes; Z‑change ≈ −1.95), which is a positive sign, but median objectively measured sleep duration fell modestly (~31 minutes shorter) and night‑to‑night variability increased (sleep duration SD increased by ~16 minutes). Median sleep start time is effectively unchanged. The combination of reduced perceived control over sleep, shorter average sleep, and increased variability is consistent with greater sleep disturbance and reduced perceived restorative sleep despite shorter latency.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm findings from the wearable:
Wearable‑derived circadian rhythm metrics show pronounced loss of rhythmic robustness. Interdaily stability (regularity between days) decreased substantially (0.54 → 0.33; delta Z ≈ −1.51) and intradaily variability (hourly fragmentation) increased markedly (0.51 → 0.94; delta Z ≈ +2.83). Cosinor amplitude dropped sharply (16.19 → 8.48; change Z ≈ −2.61), while MESOR changed only slightly. Autocorrelation at 24 hours and other measures of daily regularity decreased. Resting heart rate rose appreciably (54.2 → 62.6 bpm; delta Z ≈ +1.82), and the aggregated hourly heart‑rate profile shows elevated evening heart rates and sustained higher daytime/evening heart rates relative to the prior profile. Together these objective markers indicate increased physiological activation and a weakened, more fragmented circadian organization of cardiovascular activity.

Integration of behavioral, subjective, and physiological signals:
Across modalities the most salient, convergent signals indicate increased physiological arousal and reduced behavioral and psychosocial resources. Large changes in circadian regularity (higher intradaily variability, lower interdaily stability, large amplitude loss) and a substantial rise in resting heart rate are robust physiological indicators that commonly accompany elevated stress or allostatic load. Self‑reports align with this pattern: decreased happiness, higher depressive symptom score, lower health satisfaction, reduced social engagement and perceived control over sleep. Some measures are mixed or improved (improved sleep latency, small increase in solitary exercise frequency, modest BMI reduction), but these do not offset the magnitude of circadian disruption and increased resting heart rate combined with worsened social and affective indicators. Correlations of individual deltas with PSS change provided in the dataset are generally small, yet the magnitude and direction of the physiological circadian shifts and concurrent declines in subjective well‑being make a coherent case for increased perceived stress since the prior wave.

Overall directional assessment of perceived stress:
Weighing objective physiological evidence (notably higher resting heart rate and large loss of circadian amplitude/regularity), the decline in positive affect and social engagement, and worsening perceptions of health and sleep control, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s perceived stress has increased relative to the prior data collection.

Scores on the CES-D rose from 27 to 33 (Z-score now 2.19), retaining a classification of “Depressed” and showing a meaningful increase in depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI) increased from 56 to 63 (Z = 2.39), moving further into the anxious range. Self-esteem declined substantially (32 → 24; Z-score change ≈ -1.46), and single-item measures of happiness and health satisfaction both decreased (happiness 4 → 3; health satisfaction 4.78 → 2.0), the latter representing a large negative shift in perceived physical health. These changes are large in magnitude relative to prior values and population norms and point to greater negative mood, higher anxiety proneness, and lower perceived health and self-worth in the current assessment.

Behavioral habit data show an increase in several passive and potentially avoidant leisure activities and a small rise in alcohol use. Weekly beer consumption increased from monthly to 1–2 times per week, and time spent in sedentary hobbies and video gaming rose substantially (video games from 1–2 hours to >4 hours; sedentary hobby time increased as well). Time spent reading, listening to music, and socializing with friends increased modestly, while exercise frequency remained stable at three times per week. Taken together, these patterns indicate more time allocated to sedentary entertainment and modestly greater alcohol exposure alongside preserved formal exercise frequency; this combination can reflect changes in coping or leisure structure consistent with higher subjective distress.

Sleep data present a mixed picture: objective wearable-derived sleep improved in several respects while subjective latency worsened. Median nightly sleep duration increased by about 58 minutes (from ~7 h 20 min to ~8 h 18 min) and night-to-night variability decreased (SD 110 → 73 minutes), and median sleep start time shifted earlier by ~26 minutes. The participant also endorsed greater perceived control over sleep duration. Conversely, self-reported sleep latency increased (20 → 30 minutes). These findings indicate longer and more consistent sleep opportunity objectively, even as sleep initiation is reported as somewhat slower. Improved sleep quantity and reduced variability are generally stress-buffering, but the concurrent increases in depressive/anxiety symptoms and other behavioral changes suggest that improved sleep duration has not been sufficient to offset negative affective trends.

Cardiovascular and circadian metrics show lower overall cardiac tone but reduced circadian regularity. Resting heart rate and mesor decreased (RHR 61.2 → 56.0 bpm; mesor Δ ≈ -6.8 bpm), and amplitude is reduced, which could reflect lower tonic sympathetic drive or improved cardiovascular fitness. However, interdaily stability declined markedly (0.59 → 0.37; Z-change ≈ -1.59) and intradaily variability increased modestly, indicating a loss of day-to-day rhythmic regularity and greater fragmentation of activity-related signals. The acrophase shifted later (~5:23 PM to ~6:01 PM), and aggregated hourly heart rate profiles show lowered baseline levels across many daytime hours with relatively pronounced evening peaks. The combination of lower resting heart rate with blunted amplitude and poorer interdaily stability suggests that, physiologically, the participant’s circadian organization and daily structure have weakened even while resting cardiac values are lower.

Integrative interpretation: the strongest and most consistent signals point toward increased psychological distress. Large increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, substantial declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and behavioral shifts toward greater sedentary and gaming time weigh strongly toward worsening subjective wellbeing and stress. Physiological evidence is mixed: improved objective sleep duration and lower resting heart rate would typically associate with reduced stress, but these are countered by a marked loss in circadian regularity (interdaily stability decline, increased intradaily variability, later acrophase) and evening increases in heart rate that are compatible with dysregulated daily structure and potential evening hyperarousal. Given the magnitude of the mental-health symptom increases and the circadian/behavioral signs of reduced daily regularity and increased passive coping, the holistic balance of evidence indicates an increase in perceived stress relative to the prior assessment.

33009,2.0,"Psychological self-report and behavioral surveys indicate clear, sizable improvements in affective and trait-level measures between waves. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) fell from 9 to 4 points and trait anxiety (STAI) fell by 12 points, changes that are large relative to the instrument ranges and that move the participant from a prior anxious classification to a non-anxious classification on the STAI. Self-esteem rose markedly (a 10-point increase from 40 to 50) and self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust also increased. Health satisfaction increased modestly and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration (a shift from “Somewhat Disagree” to “Agree”). These consistent directional changes in multiple self-report indices (mood, trait anxiety, self-evaluation, perceived control) collectively point to reduced subjective affective distress and greater psychological well-being at the later wave.

Objective sleep and circadian metrics present a mixed picture that contrasts with the self-report improvements. Median nightly sleep duration measured by the wearable decreased by approximately one hour (from ~7h54m to ~6h52m) and bedtime shifted later by about 36 minutes (median start moved to ~1:27 AM). Sleep timing variability remained similar, but overall sleep quantity declined. At the same time, the participant reports shorter sleep latency and greater perceived control over sleep, suggesting subjectively one’s sleep initiation improved even while total sleep opportunity diminished. Circadian summary features show reduced interdaily stability (less regular day-to-day structure) and a delayed acrophase (from ~4:02 PM to ~5:43 PM), consistent with a phase delay and somewhat less stable circadian pattern across days.

Cardiovascular physiology derived from the wearable indicates increased baseline and tonic arousal relative to the prior wave. Resting heart rate rose by ~6 beats per minute (from ~56.9 to 63.0), MESOR of the cosinor increased by ~7.8 bpm, and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows higher mean rates across many daytime and nighttime hours compared with the previous recording. Amplitude decreased slightly. These shifts toward a higher mean heart rate and elevated hourly averages can reflect greater autonomic/physiological load, reduced cardiovascular fitness, recent illness, or other behavioral contributors (e.g., later sleep, changes in substance use). Notably, reported wine/alcohol consumption increased (one-unit increase on the survey scale), and body mass index decreased by ~2.95 units; both are notable behavioral changes that can influence physiology and sleep but do not map unambiguously onto stress direction without further context.

Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals come from self-report scales directly tied to perceived stress constructs: marked reductions in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety alongside increases in self-esteem and happiness point toward an overall reduction in perceived stress. These subjective improvements are robust in magnitude and coherent across related domains. Objective wearable signals (higher resting heart rate, delayed circadian phase, reduced sleep duration and interdaily stability) indicate increased physiological arousal and less stable daily rhythms, constituting opposing evidence that could reflect increased physiological stress or other behavioral/health changes. Given that perceived stress, by definition, is a subjective appraisal construct and is most directly indexed by self-report symptom inventories, the preponderance of psychological self-report change favors a decrease (or at least stability with improvement) in perceived stress despite concurrent physiological perturbations. On balance, the multimodal pattern is best interpreted as an overall decrease or stabilization with improvement in perceived stress.

22913,1.0,"The participant’s self-report psychological symptom profile shows notable worsening on several clinically relevant scales. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) rose from 0 to 29 (score delta +29; Z-score of delta 3.34), and trait anxiety (STAI) increased from 34 to 50 (delta +16; Z-score of delta 2.3). Both changes are large in magnitude and are positively associated (moderately) with increases in PSS in the provided correlations (CES-D delta corr = 0.25; STAI delta corr = 0.19). At the same time, several positive self-appraisals increased (self-esteem, trust, happiness, and health satisfaction all show positive deltas), but their delta correlations with PSS change are small or negative, and their z-score deltas are generally smaller than those for CES-D and STAI. The net self-report pattern therefore is mixed but dominated by large increases in depressive and anxiety symptom burden, which are commonly linked to higher perceived stress.

Behavioral lifestyle changes are generally in the direction that would be expected to support increased perceived stress. Physical activity decreased markedly (frequency of exercising alone and with others dropped to “not at all”; frequency delta -2 in each domain), sedentary hobby time increased substantially (delta +4 units; Z-score of delta 1.93), and weekday alcohol patterns shifted toward more frequent beer consumption (delta +1 frequency unit). Recreational drug use increased from “not at all” to “less than 1-2 times a month” (small absolute change). Reading and some leisure activities increased, which could be adaptive, but the large reduction in exercise combined with increased sedentary time and greater alcohol use point toward behavioral risk factors for higher perceived stress. Correlations of these behavioral deltas with PSS change are small but generally do not favor stress reduction.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology indicate improved regularity and largely preserved sleep quantity. Median sleep duration remains high (~8 h 28 min) with only a 9-minute reduction from the prior wave, and sleep start times shifted earlier by ~16 minutes while start-time variability decreased substantially (start-time SD delta -49 minutes). Circadian stability metrics derived from heart rate improved (interdaily stability increased from 0.36 to 0.64; autocorrelation at 24h increased), suggesting greater day-to-day regularity. Resting heart rate and MESOR declined modestly (resting HR -1.85 bpm; mesor -6.07), while amplitude increased slightly, and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows lower mean values across many daytime hours compared with the previous wave but an elevated late-evening peak (notably ~102 bpm at 9–10 pm). Taken together, these objective signals point to more regular sleep–wake timing and slightly lower baseline physiological arousal, though there is an evening peak in cardiac activity that could reflect episodic activation late in the day. The correlations between these wearable deltas and PSS change are small-to-negligible.

Integrative interpretation and direction of change: the dataset contains mixed signals. Objective physiology and sleep regularity have improved or remained stable (consistent sleep duration, reduced variability, increased interdaily stability, slightly lower resting HR), which would tend to support stable or lower perceived stress. However, the very large increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, combined with marked decreases in physical activity, increased sedentary behavior and increased beer consumption, represent substantial psychosocial and behavioral shifts that are more strongly associated with elevated perceived stress in the literature and in the provided delta correlations. The magnitudes of the symptom increases (CES-D and STAI) are large relative to other changes and are directly positively correlated with PSS change. Balancing these domains, the evidence that most strongly predicts higher perceived stress (large increases in depression and anxiety symptoms and adverse behavioral shifts) outweighs the signals from improved sleep regularity and modest reductions in resting heart rate. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports an overall increase in perceived stress relative to the prior collection.

48969,-2.0,"The participant shows consistent improvement on several self-report measures of negative affect and self-concept. CES-D scored 31 (down from 42), a substantial numeric reduction though it remains in the instrument’s depressed range; the z-score moved from ~3.0 to ~2.0. Trait anxiety (STAI) declined from 59 to 52, remaining elevated but reduced in magnitude (z-score change roughly -0.66). Self-esteem increased markedly (Rosenberg from 22 to 31; Z-score change +1.69) and a simple happiness item rose from 2 to 4. These changes indicate lower reported depressive and anxious symptom burden and improved self-regard relative to the prior wave, even though some instruments still signal clinically meaningful symptoms.

Sleep measures present a mixed pattern of objective improvement and subjective difficulty. Wearable-derived sleep increased in median duration from about 7 h 51 min to 8 h 58 min while night-to-night variability decreased (sleep SD dropped and the start-time SD contracted), indicating longer and more regular recorded sleep. However, self-reported sleep latency worsened (reported time to fall asleep rose from ~30 to 120 minutes) and median sleep start shifted later by ~1 h 22 min (to ~1:28 AM). The participant’s perceived control over sleep improved slightly from “strongly disagree” to “somewhat disagree.” Taken together, objective sleep quantity and regularity improved, but the participant reports greater difficulty initiating sleep and a later sleep schedule, suggesting a dissociation between subjective sleep experience and wearable-recorded sleep duration/timing.

Physiological and circadian metrics from the wearable point toward lower baseline cardiovascular activation and a more robust daily rhythm. Resting heart rate decreased markedly (71.6 to 60.4 bpm; Δ = -11.2 bpm, Z-score of the change ≈ -2.33), and the mesor fell (≈81.3 to 71.6), indicating lower average heart rate across the day. Amplitude increased (from ~7.4 to ~11.3), interdaily stability rose slightly, and intradaily variability declined modestly. Aggregated hourly heart-rate values are lower across most hours compared with the previous wave. These changes (lower resting HR, larger day-night amplitude, reduced fragmentation) are consistent with reduced sympathetic/autonomic arousal or improved cardiovascular fitness and with greater circadian consolidation.

Behavioral habit data show continued engagement in solitary exercise (three times a week or more) and increased social time (socializing increased from ≤15 minutes to 1–2 hours). Screen-based sedentary activity remains high (television/video >4 hours) and a sedentary hobby increased, while time spent on video games and internet browsing decreased. Substance use remained minimal. Self-rated overall health satisfaction declined slightly. These behavior changes suggest maintained or increased physical activity and social contact alongside persistent high recreational screen time and modest declines in perceived health.

Weighing the multimodal evidence: reductions in depressive and trait-anxiety scores, marked decreases in resting heart rate and mesor, increased circadian amplitude, reduced intradaily variability, longer and more regular objective sleep, and increased socializing and sustained exercise together provide converging evidence of reduced physiological and psychological stress load relative to the prior wave. Countervailing signals include substantially increased subjective sleep latency, later bedtimes, decreased health satisfaction, and persistent high TV time, which may represent domain-specific difficulties or residual symptoms but do not outweigh the broad pattern of improvement. On balance, the preponderance of psychological and physiological indicators points toward an overall reduction in perceived stress.

64296,-1.0,"Self-report affect and symptom measures show a pattern of worsening mood and modest increases in depressive symptomatology. The CES-D rose from 3 to 7 (Δ = +4), remaining in the non-depressed range but representing a meaningful increase in reported depressive symptoms relative to the participant’s prior report. Self-rated happiness decreased sharply (from 5 to 3; Δ = -2, Z-Score of the delta = -1.8), and self-esteem declined (45 → 41, Δ = -4). These changes are among the larger shifts in the survey battery and, taken together, indicate reduced positive affect and self-regard. The CES-D change has a modest positive correlation with PSS change in the dataset, and the magnitude of the happiness and self-esteem shifts suggests mood-based distress has increased since the previous wave.

Sleep quantity and subjective sleep control improved while sleep regularity and variability show mixed signals. Subjectively and by wearable measurement, median sleep duration increased (~42 minutes median increase from 6:52 to 7:34) and the participant reports feeling more in control of sleep duration. The median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 1 hour 11 minutes, which commonly reflects an earlier sleep schedule. However, sleep timing and duration have become more variable: sleep duration SD increased (42 → 75 minutes) and sleep start time SD increased modestly, indicating less night-to-night consistency. Circadian and rhythm-derived metrics from heart rate further indicate decreased rhythmic robustness: interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined and cosinor-derived amplitude fell substantially (16.29 → 10.77), with a lower MESOR. The combination of increased sleep quantity but reduced regularity and a weakened circadian amplitude suggests improved sleep opportunity but more fragmented or irregular daily structure.

Behavioral habits show both adaptive and potentially maladaptive changes. Physical activity increased notably: solitary exercise and organized sport frequency rose from none to multiple weekly sessions (large positive deltas). Increased exercise and some reduction in sedentary hobby time are behaviorally favorable and typically associated with stress reduction. Conversely, alcohol use (beer, and to a lesser extent wine/liquor) increased from no use to episodic use (beer now 1–2x/week), which represents a substantive behavioral change and may reflect coping-related drinking. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use remained unchanged (not reported). Overall, the activity profile is mixed—greater exercise (protective) but increased alcohol consumption (potentially indicative of stress-related coping).

Physiological heart-rate metrics and aggregated hourly profiles indicate a lower baseline cardiovascular tone but reduced circadian variation. Resting heart rate remained low and stable (50.8 bpm). The hourly aggregated heart-rate series show lower mean levels across several daytime hours compared with the prior wave, consistent with the reduced MESOR. The marked reduction in amplitude and reductions in interdaily stability point toward diminished day–night contrast in cardiovascular activation. These physiological patterns can accompany either recovery (reduced tonic arousal) or circadian disruption; in this context—paired with worsening mood, increased substance use, and increased sleep variability—the interpretation leans toward a loss of rhythmic robustness rather than an unambiguous reduction in stress physiology.

Integrated interpretation and direction of perceived stress change. Evidence supporting an increase in perceived stress includes the rise in depressive symptoms (CES-D), large decreases in self-reported happiness and self-esteem, the initiation/increase of alcohol use, and the pronounced weakening of circadian amplitude and day-to-day stability. Offsetting evidence that might indicate stability or improvement includes increased objective and subjective sleep duration, earlier bedtimes, increased exercise frequency, and higher health satisfaction; these are protective factors that could mitigate stress. However, the magnitude of affective declines (particularly happiness) and the concurrent behavioral indicators associated with coping (alcohol use) and circadian disruption provide stronger evidence of an overall worsening in the participant’s psychological stress state relative to the previous assessment. Considering the pattern and relative sizes of these signal changes, the balance of multimodal data supports an increase in perceived stress.

77036,-3.0,"Multimodal summary and self-report psychological change:
The participant’s self-report profile shows a mixed pattern of small-to-moderate change. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D increased from 8 to 12 (Δ = +4; Z-score of delta 0.58) but remain in the non-depressed range. Trait anxiety (STAI) was stable (43 at both waves). Self-esteem increased modestly (38 → 40; Δ = +2; Z-score of delta 0.39). Subjective happiness decreased by one point (4 → 3; Z-score of delta −0.96). Health satisfaction rose substantially (3.56 → 5.00; Z-score of delta 1.28). Taken together, self-report indices show both improvements in self-evaluations of health and self-worth and some worsening in mood-related items (slight CES-D rise, lower momentary happiness), with trait anxiety unchanged.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle:
Reported behavior shifts include increased social and group exercise (e.g., “exercised with others” moved to three times per week or more; large Z change 2.42) and greater time spent listening to music and socializing modestly. Alcohol use increased (beer moved from <monthly to 1–2×/week; wine from none to 1–2×/month), with large Z-scores of change for substance use items. Recreational and nonprescribed drug use remained at zero. These changes indicate greater social and group activity and more frequent alcohol consumption; the increased social/physical activity is plausibly stress-buffering, while increased alcohol use could reflect coping or greater social drinking.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics:
Objective cardiophysiological signals show notable improvement in baseline cardiovascular markers: resting heart rate decreased substantially (66.8 → 59.6 bpm; Δ = −7.2 bpm; Z-score of delta −1.48), with lower aggregated heart rates across many overnight and daytime hours compared to the previous period. Cosinor-derived MESOR declined slightly while amplitude increased modestly; acrophase remained essentially unchanged (≈3:50 PM). Circadian regularity measures moved toward greater fragmentation or reduced day-to-day regularity: interdaily stability decreased (0.58 → 0.49) while intradaily variability increased (0.32 → 0.49), and autocorrelation at 24 h fell. The pattern suggests lower tonic cardiovascular arousal and potential improvements in fitness or recovery, coinciding with somewhat less regular daily rhythm structure.

Sleep—objective vs subjective:
Objective sleep from the wearable indicates an increase in median sleep duration (6 h 51 min → 7 h 22 min; Δ ≈ +31 min) and an earlier median sleep start (00:47 → 00:10; earlier by ~36 min). Sleep start time variability and sleep duration variability both increased (greater standard deviations), indicating more inconsistent timing despite increased mean duration. In contrast, self-reported normal weekday sleep duration decreased (7 h → 6 h), and sleep latency increased (20 → 30 min). This divergence suggests the participant’s perceived sleep worsened or was less satisfactory despite objectively longer sleep on average; increased sleep latency and perceived shorter weekday sleep may contribute to reports of decreased happiness or elevated CES-D scores even as wearable metrics show improved mean duration and lower resting heart rate.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress:
Multiple objective and behavioral indicators point toward a reduction in physiological stress load or improved recovery: a large drop in resting heart rate, objectively longer median sleep duration, and increased frequency of social exercise and health satisfaction are consistent with decreased perceived stress. Countervailing signals include a modest rise in depressive symptom frequency (still subclinical), lower self-reported happiness, increased alcohol use, and reduced circadian stability (greater variability), which could indicate behavioral irregularity or socially driven schedule changes that may elevate perceived stress for some. The magnitude of improvement in resting physiology (large negative delta in RHR) and the sizable increase in exercise with others and health satisfaction are relatively strong indicators of improved adaptive functioning. Given the balance of evidence — notable physiological improvements and enhanced social/health behaviors versus modest negative mood and alcohol increases — the overall signal is more consistent with stable to decreased perceived stress rather than a net increase.

82986,3.0,"Psychological self-report and symptom measures are largely low and relatively stable. The participant’s baseline PSS was 19 (Z = -0.71) and trait measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5) and trait anxiety (STAI = 27) remain in low ranges, with only small score increases since the prior wave (CES-D +1, STAI +2). Self-esteem remains high relative to the sample (RSES Z ≈ 1.65) with a minimal decline of one point. Subjective well-being indicators such as reported happiness and interpersonal trust are high and essentially unchanged. These patterns indicate no substantive worsening in self-reported affective symptoms; minor upward tick in depressive/anxiety scores is small in magnitude and remains within low ranges.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology show several improvements in regularity and timing. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration increased by about 36 minutes (from ~5:06 to ~5:42), sleep onset moved earlier by ~1 hour 16 minutes (median start shifted from ~02:24 to ~01:08), and night-to-night variability in sleep start time decreased. Interdaily stability of the heart rate circadian signal increased (Δ = +0.08), and cosinor-derived acrophase shifted earlier (peak moved from ~5:17 PM to ~3:57 PM). These changes together indicate an earlier, more regular daily schedule and modestly longer objective sleep. There is, however, a discrepancy between subjective weekday sleep reports (self-reported normal weekday sleep dropped to 4.5 hours) and the wearable median (≈5.7 hours), suggesting either differences in what the participant considers “normal” sleep episodes or inconsistent perceptions of sleep sufficiency.

Cardiovascular and circadian amplitude metrics point toward reduced physiological arousal. Resting heart rate decreased substantially from 68.4 to 60.6 bpm (Δ = -7.8 bpm), and the mesor of the aggregated heart rate rhythm decreased modestly, while amplitude increased. Aggregated hourly heart rate values are lower across many daytime and nighttime hours compared with the prior wave. The reduction in resting heart rate and the earlier, higher-amplitude circadian peak are most consistent with decreased tonic sympathetic arousal and an overall shift toward a more pronounced and earlier daily rhythm. Intradaily variability (a measure of fragmentation) increased, which may reflect more frequent transitions in activity/rest within the day; this is a countervailing signal that could reflect fragmented daytime routines or intermittent activity bursts, but it does not negate the overall lower resting HR and improved timing.

Behavioral context shows mixed changes that moderate the physiological signals. Frequency of solitary exercise is unchanged at 1–2 times per week; exercising with others declined to none. Socializing time is stable. Internet use decreased and listening to music increased slightly. BMI increased by 0.83 points and self-reported health satisfaction declined slightly. These lifestyle shifts are modest in magnitude and do not provide strong directional pressure toward greater perceived stress, although the BMI increase and reduced in-person group exercise could be relevant for longer-term well-being.

Holistic synthesis: physiological and objective-sleep markers provide stronger and more consistent evidence of reduced physiological stress and improved circadian regularity (notably large drop in resting heart rate, earlier sleep timing, increased interdaily stability), while self-report mood and stress-related symptoms remain low and largely stable with only minimal increases that remain subclinical. Some signals (increased intradaily variability, increased BMI, and continued reports of very short subjective weekday sleep) temper a uniform interpretation but are smaller in magnitude or inconsistent across modalities. Taking the multimodal evidence together, the balance favors a decrease or stability (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

11402,5.0,"Self-report psychiatric and affective measures show notable worsening between waves. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) rose substantially from 17 to 32 (delta +15, Z-score delta +1.79), and trait anxiety increased modestly (STAI 54 → 57). Self-esteem declined markedly (Rosenberg 40 → 24, delta −16, Z-score of delta −2.94). Interpersonal trust also decreased (3.83 → 2.67, delta −1.17, Z-score of delta −2.99). Self-reported overall happiness was unchanged, but the magnitude and direction of change in core internalizing indicators (large CES-D increase and steep self-esteem decline) indicate a meaningful deterioration in self-reported mood and self-concept since the prior wave.

Lifestyle and activity patterns shifted in ways that can exacerbate distress. Alcohol use by type increased modestly (wine/liquor frequency up by one category) and previously absent recreational and non-prescribed drug use appeared at low but nonzero frequency. Sedentary recreational time increased (sedentary hobby and video gaming both rose; video game time is high relative to the sample), whereas organized social exercise decreased slightly. Reading and some solitary recreation increased, while socializing time was unchanged. These changes indicate more solitary/sedentary leisure and an initiation of substance use, both of which are commonly associated with elevated psychological strain.

Sleep reports and wearable sleep metrics show a mixed picture of subjective control but shifted timing. On surveys the participant reports stronger perceived control over sleep but also reports a drop in habitual weekday sleep (self-reported normal weekday sleep down from 7 to 6 hours). Objective sleep via the Fitbit shows a small increase in median nightly sleep (around 6 h 29 min, a 10-minute increase) and slightly reduced night-to-night variability; however median sleep start time shifted about one hour later (03:17 → 04:18). Sleep latency is only modestly changed. Thus subjective reports reflect greater desire for and perceived control of sleep but also a perception of sleeping less on weekdays; objective data show late sleep timing with only slight change in duration, indicating potential mismatch between perceived and measured sleep and a later circadian phase.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular indices overall suggest greater circadian regularity but increased evening physiological arousal. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation increased (improved regularity), intradaily variability decreased slightly, and amplitude of the cosinor rhythm increased meaningfully (amplitude +4.09, Z-score of delta +1.38). Resting heart rate declined (66.9 → 61.2 bpm, delta −5.7), consistent with lower baseline cardiac activation or improved fitness. Hourly aggregated heart rate shows lower overnight and early-morning averages but larger peaks in the late afternoon and evening (notable increases around 5–8 pm and 8–11 pm). This pattern suggests a lower resting baseline combined with pronounced evening arousal or activity (which could reflect later activity, stimulants, intensive evening screen time or social/behavioral activation).

Integrative interpretation and direction of change in perceived stress: the data are mixed but the strongest signals point toward worsening perceived stress. The very large increase in depressive symptoms and the steep drop in self-esteem, together with new substance use and increased solitary/sedentary leisure, are behaviorally and clinically meaningful indicators that are typically associated with higher perceived stress. Physiological markers (lower resting heart rate, improved interdaily stability, and increased circadian amplitude) point to some improvements in circadian regularity and baseline cardiovascular profile, which could reflect behavioral structuring or fitness changes that might buffer stress. However, the magnitude and psychological salience of the worsening mood-related self-reports outweigh the physiological and small positive health signals when assessing perceived stress. Therefore, taking the multimodal evidence holistically, the balance favors an increase in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

38610,-3.0,"Multimodal self-report and behavioral summary:
The self-report data show a mixed pattern. Measures of mood and well-being moved in a negative direction: the CES-D increased from 3 to 7 (still classified as not depressed), trait anxiety (STAI) rose modestly (28 → 31) and single-item happiness fell substantially (5 → 3). Health satisfaction also declined (5.78 → 4.44). Self-esteem remained essentially unchanged. At the same time, several lifestyle behaviors that are commonly protective against stress show improvement: reported weekday sleep duration increased from 6 to 8 hours and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep; time spent socializing increased markedly; group exercise frequency remained high even as solitary exercise dropped. Substance use shows only a small uptick in wine consumption and no change in recreational drug use.

Objective sleep and circadian patterns:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics indicate a large, robust improvement in sleep quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep increased by approximately 2 hours 39 minutes (from ~5h46m to ~8h25m), sleep onset shifted earlier by nearly two hours, and variability in sleep timing remained low. Circadian summary features are consistent with greater daily structure: interdaily stability increased, intradaily variability decreased, autocorrelation at 24 hours rose, and amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm increased. Collectively these changes point to a stronger, more consolidated sleep–wake rhythm and substantially greater total sleep time between waves.

Physiological arousal and heart-rate profile:
Resting heart rate increased by ~4.4 bpm (67.2 → 71.6), which is a moderate upward shift relative to the study population. Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show higher evening/night values in the current period compared with the previous period and a later acrophase (peak shifted from ~4:54 PM to ~6:47 PM). An increased resting heart rate can reflect higher physiological arousal, changes in fitness, or other behavioral factors (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, illness), and its direction here contrasts with improved sleep and circadian regularity. The magnitude of the RHR increase is notable but not large enough on its own to indicate pervasive autonomic dysregulation.

Evidence for worsening perceived stress:
Signs that would support an increase in perceived stress include the rise in depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (albeit both remain low in absolute terms), the marked drop in self-reported happiness, decreased health satisfaction, and the increase in resting heart rate. The CES-D delta has a small positive correlation with PSS change in the dataset, suggesting that worsening mood is associated with PSS increases in this sample.

Evidence for improvement or stability in perceived stress:
Countervailing evidence points toward improved or stable perceived stress: objective sleep duration and timing improved markedly and sleep regularity strengthened (large Z-score changes), social activity increased substantially, and circadian rhythm metrics (interdaily stability, autocorrelation, reduced intradaily variability) moved in directions typically associated with lower perceived stress and better recovery. Group exercise remained frequent and sedentary hobby time declined, which may reflect more active engagement with others. Many of the wearable-derived changes (sleep and circadian consolidation) are large in magnitude and are established protective factors for perceived stress.

Holistic synthesis and conclusion:
The data present a mixed signal: subjective mood and health-satisfaction indicators moved toward worse values, while objective behavioral regulation (sleep quantity, timing and circadian stability) and social engagement improved, and resting heart rate rose modestly. Given the very large, objective improvement in sleep duration and circadian regularity (both strongly linked to reductions in perceived stress) together with increased socializing and stable self-esteem, these protective changes appear to outweigh the modest deteriorations in mood symptoms and health satisfaction for the purpose of inferring change in perceived stress. Therefore, on balance the multimodal evidence indicates that perceived stress has not meaningfully worsened and is more consistent with stability or a net decrease.

96610,-2.0,"The self-report psychological measures show small improvements or stability across affective domains. Scores on the CES-D and STAI-Trait both declined modestly (CES-D -1 point; STAI -3 points), retaining classifications of “not depressed” and “not anxious.” Self-esteem remains high and unchanged, and single-item happiness and health satisfaction scores are high and stable. Interpersonal trust shows a slight numeric decline but remains near the sample mean. Together, these survey-level changes indicate either small reductions in negative affect and trait anxiety or maintenance of a favorable psychological profile between waves.

Objective sleep obtained from the wearable shows a clear, substantive improvement in sleep quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep increased by about one hour (from ~6:53 to ~7:57) and night-to-night variability in duration decreased (SD down ~20 minutes). Sleep start time remained late (~1:20 a.m.) but became more consistent (start-time SD reduced). Subjective reports of weekday sleep duration and latency did not change, suggesting the participant’s perceived sleep pattern remained similar even as wearable data indicate longer and more regular sleep. Improved sleep duration and greater night-to-night regularity are typically associated with reduced perceived stress and better mood regulation.

Behavioral activity patterns show mixed but largely positive changes. The participant reports a marked increase in frequency of exercising alone (from rare to 1–2 times/week) while activity with others and sports participation declined. Socializing time increased modestly and reading time rose from none to a brief daily habit; internet use increased. Substance use remains absent. Overall, these shifts reflect an increase in solitary exercise and some expansion of low-intensity recreational and social activities, which could support mood and coping even as team or group-based physical activities reduced.

Physiological cardiovascular and circadian metrics give a more complex signal. Resting heart rate increased substantially (from 61.1 to 69.4 bpm; Z-score of the change ≈ +1.8), and many aggregated hourly heart rate values are higher in the current wave than previously, particularly across midday and evening hours. Cosinor-derived MESOR rose slightly while amplitude decreased, and intradaily variability increased modestly; interdaily stability changed little. Taken together, these wearable cardiovascular findings suggest elevated basal cardiovascular activation and a reduction in diurnal heart-rate amplitude despite preserved day-to-day regularity. Because these heart-rate metrics are aggregated and can reflect multiple influences (fitness, illness, stimulant use, measurement factors), they indicate increased physiological arousal but do not by themselves specify a psychological cause.

Integrating the multimodal evidence relevant to perceived stress: psychological self-reports (lower anxiety and depressive symptom scores, sustained high self-esteem and happiness), improved objective sleep duration and regularity, and increased individual exercise and socializing provide converging evidence for stable or improved perceived stress and coping capacity. These indicators are counterbalanced by a marked rise in resting heart rate and modest increases in intradaily variability with reduced circadian amplitude, which point to increased physiological arousal that could reflect higher stress, reduced fitness, illness, or other non-psychological factors. On balance, because improvements in affective symptoms and sleep—which are directly tied to perceived stress—are relatively large and consistent while the primary physiological signal of change (RHR) is isolated and ambiguous in cause, the overall pattern favors stability or modest improvement in perceived stress rather than a clear worsening.

77711,-1.0,"Multimodal self-report summary: On self-report instruments, depressive symptoms (CES-D) were unchanged and trait anxiety (STAI) showed a very small decrease (52 → 51), indicating no clear reduction in affective symptom burden over the interval. In contrast, self-esteem fell by four points (28 → 24; Z-change ≈ -0.72), and global health satisfaction declined substantially (3.44 → 2.11; Z-change ≈ -1.28). Subjective happiness remained stable. Together, these self-report shifts indicate a deterioration in self-evaluative and health-related perceptions despite stable scores for mood symptoms and trait anxiety.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle: Several health-related behaviors changed in ways that can be associated with increased stress load or reduced recovery. Alcohol use increased from monthly to weekly for both beer and wine/liquor. Frequency of exercising alone decreased (weekly → monthly) while group exercise remained stable and sports participation increased slightly from very low to occasional. Time spent socializing increased notably (from 1–2 hours to 3–4 hours per day) and passive screen time for TV dropped; listening to music remained high. These mixed changes suggest increased social engagement but also greater alcohol consumption and reduced solitary exercise, patterns consistent with compensatory coping and potential reductions in restorative routine.

Sleep and sleep-related perceptions: Objective and subjective sleep indicators moved toward later and somewhat less regular sleep. Median sleep start time shifted later by about 1 hour and 5 minutes (≈01:02 → 02:08), median nightly sleep duration shortened modestly (~14 minutes less; 6h55 → 6h41), and night-to-night variability in sleep timing increased. Self-reported sleep latency rose from 5 to 10 minutes, and the participant continues to report disagreement with being in control over sleep duration. These features—later sleep timing, increased timing variability, and slightly shorter sleep—are commonly associated with elevated stress and reduced circadian alignment.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian rhythm: Heart-rate-derived circadian structure shows reduced regularity and higher within-day fragmentation. Interdaily stability decreased (0.37 → 0.29) while intradaily variability increased (0.53 → 0.72), indicating less consistent day-to-day rhythm and more fragmented activity or arousal patterns across hours. Mean circadian level (MESOR) increased by ≈7.7 bpm and resting heart rate rose substantially from 53.4 to 60.4 bpm (+7.0 bpm; Z-change ≈ 1.52). Aggregated hourly heart rate values are higher across many daytime hours—particularly a pronounced mid-afternoon elevation—relative to the prior period. Acrophase shifted later (≈4:54 PM → 5:17 PM). The combination of a higher resting heart rate, an elevated mesor, increased intraday variability, and later acrophase are physiologic indicators consistent with heightened sympathetic activation, reduced recovery, and less stable circadian organization.

Integration and implications for perceived stress: The most salient signals pointing toward increased perceived stress are (1) the marked increase in resting heart rate and MESOR combined with greater intradaily variability and lower interdaily stability, (2) later and more variable sleep timing with slightly reduced sleep duration and lower perceived control over sleep, (3) declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and (4) increased alcohol consumption. Countervailing observations—stable depressive symptoms and a small decrease in trait anxiety, increased socializing, and unchanged self-reported happiness—provide some protective context but do not outweigh the converging behavioral and physiological evidence of greater activation and reduced circadian/behavioral regularity. Magnitude-wise, the physiological shifts (≈+7 bpm RHR; decreased interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability) and the self-esteem/health-satisfaction drops are prominent and commonly associated with increased perceived stress.

Overall direction of change in perceived stress: On balance, the multimodal pattern—elevated resting heart rate and mean circadian HR, greater rhythm fragmentation, later and less regular sleep, increased alcohol use, and declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction—most consistently aligns with a worsening (increase) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

17020,-7.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report psychological traits and health-related behaviors:
Between waves the participant reports a pattern of improved self-reported psychological functioning on several standard instruments. Trait anxiety (STAI) fell from 40 to 33 (moved from the anxious to the not-anxious category) and depressive symptom score (CES-D) decreased modestly from 10 to 8. Self-esteem is essentially unchanged (40 → 39). Health satisfaction increased substantially (3.22 → 4.78). Concurrent behavioral changes that commonly accompany improved subjective well-being include increased socializing (an increase in reported time with friends), greater participation in sports (from monthly to weekly), and a small increase in recreational alcohol use (wine/liquor from none to 1–2×/month). Overall, the self-report profile indicates reductions in core negative affective traits and increased engagement in social and active leisure.

Sleep-related self-report and wearable sleep summary:
Subjective and device-derived sleep metrics show a mixed picture. Median sleep duration increased by about 35 minutes (from ~7:07 to ~7:42), and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration (shift from “somewhat disagree” to “agree”). However, sleep initiation has become later and more delayed relative to the previous wave: median sleep start shifted roughly 1 hour 28 minutes later (to ~03:41). Sleep latency (time to fall asleep) increased from 30 to 45 minutes, and night-to-night variability in duration increased (SD from 108 to 147 minutes). These results describe longer total sleep on average and greater perceived control, but with later sleep timing, greater variability, and prolonged sleep onset—features consistent with a shifted and less regular sleep schedule.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate indicate reduced 24-hour rhythm stability. Interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours both decreased meaningfully (interdaily stability 0.54 → 0.44; autocorrelation 0.38 → 0.14), and the acrophase shifted later (from ~5:35 PM to ~8:56 PM), indicating a later phase of the heart-rate rhythm. Mesor and amplitude increased modestly and resting heart rate rose slightly (50.0 → 52.4 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart rates are notably elevated across many late-evening and nocturnal hours in the current wave relative to the prior wave, with higher mean rates during late night and early morning time bins. These wearable patterns point to reduced circadian regularity and greater nocturnal/late-evening cardiovascular activity, which can reflect altered sleep–wake timing, increased nocturnal arousal, or lifestyle-driven phase delay.

Evidence consistent with increased perceived stress:
Objective physiology and sleep timing provide signals that could reflect increased physiological arousal or circadian disruption: decreased interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours, later acrophase, increased nocturnal and late-evening heart rates, longer sleep latency, and greater night-to-night variability in sleep duration. Small increases in BMI and initiation of occasional wine/liquor use also represent behavioral changes sometimes associated with increased allostatic load or stress-related lifestyle changes. These elements are the primary indicators in the current dataset that might be interpreted as consistent with heightened physiological stress exposure or dysregulated daily structure.

Evidence consistent with decreased or stable perceived stress:
Self-report affective measures and functional health measures show clearer improvement: notable reductions in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, marked increase in health satisfaction, increased social engagement and sports participation, and a greater sense of control over sleep duration. Normal weekday sleep duration increased modestly, and self-esteem remained largely stable. The participant’s initial PSS score (24) and its negative correlation with change suggest regression toward lower perceived stress for higher initial scorers in the sample; combined with the self-report improvements, this supports an interpretation of stable or reduced perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and weighting:
When integrating modalities, the strongest and most consistent signals of change come from self-report psychological measures and social/behavioral engagement (anxiety and depressive symptoms down, health satisfaction and social/exercise engagement up). Objective physiology and sleep timing show clear circadian phase delay and reduced 24-hour regularity along with some increased nocturnal cardiovascular tone and increased sleep latency—signals that contrast with the self-report improvements. Given the magnitude and direction of change across domains, the balance of evidence favors an overall decrease or stabilization of perceived stress (improvements in affective symptom measures and health satisfaction are relatively large and consistent), while noting that circadian and sleep-timing disruption represent important contemporaneous risks that may blunt or complicate subjective recovery. On balance, the multimodal profile is best described as subjective stress and mood improvement despite increased circadian irregularity and later sleep timing.

22455,-4.0,"Over the two-year interval the participant shows pronounced worsening on self-report measures of affective state. Scores on the CES-D rose from 12 to 25 (Δ = +13; Z‑score of delta = 1.57) and the STAI-Trait rose from 28 to 46 (Δ = +18; Z‑score of delta = 2.55); both changes are large in magnitude and both deltas have modest positive correlations with change in PSS (CES-D Δ r = 0.26; STAI Δ r = 0.20). Self-reported happiness decreased (−1) and self-esteem decreased slightly (−3), while trust remained very low and health satisfaction is nominally higher but stable. Taken together, the affective and trait-anxiety measures provide strong evidence of increased negative mood and anxiety proneness relative to the prior wave.

Behavioral and social habits shifted in ways typically associated with elevated stress and reduced social support. Time spent socializing dropped substantially (from ~2–3 hours to 16–30 minutes), internet usage increased (by ~1 hour to >4 hours/day), and passive media consumption patterns changed (watching videos decreased but listening to music decreased markedly). Frequency of exercising alone remained high and unchanged, and there is no increase in substance use. The marked reduction in social interaction alongside increased solitary screen time is consistent with behavioral patterns that often accompany higher perceived stress.

Sleep measures present a mixed picture with objective improvement but worsening subjective control. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration increased by ~44 minutes (from 6:07 to 6:51) and night-to-night variability decreased, with earlier and more consistent sleep start times. In contrast the participant’s self-reported typical weekday sleep remained low (5 hours) and the sense of control over sleep declined (from “Strongly Agree” to “Somewhat Agree”). This discrepancy—objective gains in median duration and regularity but persistent subjective short weekday sleep and reduced perceived control—suggests partial restoration of sleep quantity across recordings but continued subjective sleep disturbance or perceived insufficient sleep during weekdays.

Cardiovascular and circadian physiology indicate increased daytime arousal and altered rhythm structure. Resting heart rate increased substantially (+7.7 bpm) and MESOR (mean of the fitted circadian rhythm) increased (+9.3 bpm), while amplitude decreased modestly; intradaily variability increased and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased. The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows elevated mean rates across many daytime hours and a pronounced early-morning peak that differs from the prior profile, consistent with higher daytime physiological activation or more intense activity during specific hours. Correlations between these physiological deltas and PSS change are small, but the pattern of higher resting/mean heart rate together with increased rhythm fragmentation aligns with greater physiological load or arousal in the current period.

Integrating multimodal signals, the strongest and most consistent indicators point toward increased perceived stress. Large increases in depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety are the clearest signals and these changes are positively associated with PSS change. Behavioral shifts (reduced socializing, increased solitary screen time) and elevated daytime cardiovascular activation provide additional converging evidence. Countervailing data include modest objective improvement in median sleep duration and stable exercise frequency, and a small increase in self-rated health satisfaction; however, these do not outweigh the magnitude of affective and physiological changes. On balance, the pattern of results is most consistent with a worsening (increase) in perceived stress relative to the prior data collection wave.

57443,-3.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report affect and behaviors:
The participant’s self-reported affective measures show mixed but notable changes. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) remained stable at a clinically elevated score (19), while trait anxiety (STAI) increased modestly by 2 points. Self-esteem declined by 2 points and self-reported happiness decreased from 4 to 3, both changes modest but directionally negative. Health satisfaction declined substantially (from 4.56 to 3.0; Z-score change ≈ -1.49), indicating a notable drop in perceived physical well-being. In parallel, the participant reports small-to-moderate increases in social and active behaviors (exercising with others and participation in sports increased, and time socializing rose), while also reporting increased internet use and a new pattern of light alcohol use (beer and wine monthly). Taken together, subjective mood and health-evaluation measures trend downward, whereas some behavioral engagement (exercise, socializing) increased.

Objective sleep and circadian measures:
Sleep measures show a consistent improvement in quantity and some stabilization of timing. Self-reported typical weekday sleep rose from 6 to 8 hours (large change; Z-score of delta ≈ 1.93) and sleep latency shortened (from 15 to 5 minutes). Wearable-derived median nightly sleep increased by roughly 28 minutes with decreased night-to-night start-time variability, and median sleep start shifted later by about 31 minutes. These changes point to greater overall sleep opportunity and faster sleep onset, and reduced variability in sleep timing. Circadian regularity, however, shows some weakening: interdaily stability dropped (0.54 → 0.44) and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined substantially (0.51 → 0.24), suggesting the day-to-day consistency of the heart-rate rhythm decreased even as sleep duration increased.

Physiological arousal and heart-rate patterns:
Cardiovascular indicators show a marked reduction in tonic heart-rate levels. Resting heart rate decreased from 64.0 to 57.6 bpm (Z-score change ≈ -1.31) and mesor (cosinor mean) declined by about 8.9 bpm (Z-score of delta ≈ -1.71). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles are lower across most hours in the current period compared with the prior period, particularly in overnight and many daytime windows, indicating lower average physiological arousal. Amplitude reduced slightly and acrophase remained near the previous timing, so the rhythm’s mean level dropped more than its timing shifted. The combination of lower resting heart rate and increased exercise/sports participation is consistent with improved cardiovascular conditioning or reduced basal sympathetic activity.

Integration and behavioral-physiological implications for perceived stress:
Several objective markers associated with lower physiological stress—substantially lower resting heart rate, increased overall sleep duration and faster sleep onset, and greater engagement in exercise and social activities—point toward decreased physiologic and behavioral risk factors for elevated perceived stress. Conversely, subjective reports of decreased happiness, lower health satisfaction, and reduced self-esteem provide countervailing evidence consistent with increased perceived stress or reduced well-being. Depressive symptoms were unchanged and trait anxiety rose slightly. Notably, circadian regularity weakened (lower interdaily stability and autocorrelation), which can be linked to worse stress regulation despite improved sleep quantity. Correlations provided in the dataset for many deltas are generally small, suggesting no single metric fully explains PSS change; however, the magnitude of objective improvements (large sleep gain and sizable drop in resting HR) are robust relative to other deltas.

Overall direction of change in perceived stress:
Evidence for an increase in perceived stress: declines in happiness, self-esteem, and health satisfaction, together with a small increase in trait anxiety, are subjective signals that would be expected to raise perceived stress levels. Evidence for stability or decrease in perceived stress: pronounced improvements in sleep duration and latency, large reductions in resting heart rate and mesor, and increased physical and social activity are behaviorally and physiologically consistent with reduced perceived stress. Balancing these signals, the objective physiological and sleep improvements are substantial in magnitude and accompanied by increased protective behaviors (exercise, socializing), while the negative subjective shifts are moderate-to-large but not accompanied by increased depressive symptoms. On balance, the multimodal profile indicates a net movement toward reduced physiological arousal and improved restorative behavior that would likely reduce perceived stress or keep it stable, despite some worsening in self-reported mood and health satisfaction. Therefore the overall direction is best characterized as stable or decreased perceived stress.

29257,-1.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological summary:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a substantial reduction in median nightly sleep duration between waves, from about 7 h 49 min to 6 h 06 min (a decrease of ~1 h 42 min). Sleep onset is delayed by roughly one hour (median start moved from ~01:32 to ~02:39) while night-to-night variability in start time modestly decreased. High variability in sleep duration remains (SD ≈ 150 minutes). Circadian rhythm summary indices are mixed: interdaily stability increased (0.30 → 0.40), indicating somewhat greater day-to-day regularity, but intradaily variability increased (0.47 → 0.64), indicating more fragmentation of the within-day pattern. Cosinor parameters show a small decrease in mesor and an increase in amplitude; acrophase timing shifted only slightly. Resting heart rate decreased from ~67.7 to 65.0 bpm and aggregated hourly heart rates are generally lower in many previously elevated daytime windows compared with the earlier wave, suggesting a modest reduction in baseline cardiovascular activation across the day.

Self-report psychological traits and health behaviors:
Self-report instruments present a mixed pattern. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) rose by one point but remain low and classified as not depressed; trait anxiety (STAI) fell slightly (31 → 29). Self-esteem decreased by 6 points (reported change), and overall health satisfaction declined (≈5.22 → 4.33). Social and recreational behaviors are mostly stable, though exercise with others decreased and solitary exercise frequency was unchanged. The participant reports wanting more sleep (ideal weekday sleep increased from 6 to 8 hours) while typical weekday sleep duration reported stayed at about 6 hours, consistent with the objective reduction in recorded sleep.

Integration with indicators relevant to perceived stress:
Several signals commonly associated with increased perceived stress are present: a notable reduction in sleep duration and later sleep timing, increased intradaily variability (greater fragmentation of circadian/activity patterns), decreased self-reported health satisfaction, and a drop in self-esteem. These changes are substantial in magnitude (sleep delta large relative to population norms; self-esteem delta notable) and would typically be interpreted as stress-elevating. Countervailing evidence includes a modest reduction in resting heart rate and somewhat lower aggregated daytime heart-rate peaks relative to the previous wave, and a small decrease in trait anxiety scores; increased interdaily stability is also generally favorable. Many of the included delta-to-PSS correlations are small, and the initial PSS (19) was below the study mean (Z ≈ -0.71) with a negative correlation to change (higher initial PSS associated with greater decreases), which implies that a lower initial PSS offers less “regression toward improvement.” Taken holistically, the directional weight of change—particularly the large reduction in objective sleep and declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction—aligns more with an increase in perceived stress than with an overall improvement.

Conclusion:
The balance of behavioral and physiological evidence (notably shorter and later sleep, greater within-day fragmentation, and declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction) indicates a net movement toward higher perceived stress relative to the prior wave, despite some physiological signals (lower resting HR, slight anxiety reduction) that could reflect improved fitness or transient changes. Based on the integrated pattern, the participant’s perceived stress is assessed as increased.

63904,-8.0,"Multimodal summary and context
The participant’s profile shows a complex pattern of change across self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological domains. Objective wearable data indicate major alterations in sleep timing and duration and a shift toward a lower, blunted daily heart-rate profile. Self-report measures show both improvements (reduced depressive symptom score; higher self-reported happiness) and declines (lower self-esteem, lower health satisfaction, slightly higher trait anxiety). Daily habits have also changed: markedly increased Internet use and decreased in-person socializing, with no reported exercise or substance use in either wave. Together, these concurrent changes produce mixed signals, but several salient shifts (marked sleep loss, reduced daytime social engagement, later sleep timing, and reduced circadian stability) are characteristic of a behavioral state that often accompanies higher perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian behavior
Sleep was one of the clearest domains of deterioration. Median nightly sleep duration measured by the wearable fell from 5 h 49 min to 4 h 29 min (Δ ≈ −1 h 20 min) and the participant’s self-reported typical weekday sleep shortened from 5 to 4 hours. Sleep start time shifted later by approximately 1 hour 14 minutes, and day-to-day sleep duration variability increased. The participant also reports low perceived control over sleep and endorses an unusually low “ideal” sleep duration (5 hours), suggesting acceptance of curtailed sleep rather than an expressed preference for restorative sleep. These changes—substantially shorter sleep, later and more irregular timing—are often associated with greater perceived stress and reduced capacity for cognitive and emotional regulation.

Physiological arousal and circadian rhythm metrics
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a lower overall cardiac level (mesor decreased from 78.8 to 72.4 bpm) and a lower resting heart rate (from 61.6 to 54.6 bpm). Amplitude of the rhythm decreased and interdaily stability declined (0.59 → 0.47), while intradaily variability increased slightly, indicating a weaker, less stable circadian structure. A lower resting heart rate can reflect improved cardiovascular fitness or reduced sympathetic tone; however, given the absence of exercise and a small increase in BMI, the reduction in mean heart rate and blunted amplitude more plausibly reflect a reduced diurnal range or altered autonomic regulation rather than improved physical conditioning. Blunted amplitude and reduced rhythm stability are consistent with disrupted circadian organization and can be associated with greater stress or dysregulated stress responses.

Self-report psychological measures and health perceptions
Depressive symptoms as measured by CES-D decreased substantially (30 → 22), though the score remains elevated relative to the sample; concurrently self-reported happiness increased (2 → 4). However, trait anxiety increased slightly (53 → 55), self-esteem declined (30 → 26), and satisfaction with overall physical health fell appreciably (3.44 → 2.11). Trust levels remained low and unchanged. These mixed psychological signals suggest some improvement in affective symptom burden concurrent with declines in self-evaluative domains (self-esteem, health satisfaction) and a persistent high anxiety proneness. The combination of higher trait anxiety and lower self-esteem/health satisfaction is often aligned with increases in perceived stress, even when depressive symptom frequency falls.

Behavioral context: activity, social contact, and screen time
Behavioral changes include a meaningful increase in Internet usage (an increase of ~2 hours, presently >4 hours/day) and reduced time socializing with friends (−2 hours). The participant reports minimal physical activity and no engagement in substance use. Increased screen time and reduced face-to-face social interaction, paired with sleep loss and circadian disruption, are behavioral patterns strongly linked in the literature to elevated perceived stress and poorer stress recovery. The emergence of these patterns alongside reduced health satisfaction and lower self-esteem points toward an overall behavioral ecology less supportive of stress buffering.

Integration and directional assessment
Balancing the data, there are both signals consistent with reduced distress (notably the decrease in depressive symptom burden and higher self-reported happiness) and multiple, relatively large signals consistent with increasing stress (severe reduction in sleep duration, later and less stable sleep timing, reduced circadian stability and amplitude, increased internet use, decreased socializing, lower health satisfaction, and lower self-esteem). Physiological heart-rate reductions are ambiguous in direction: although lower resting heart rate alone could indicate lower physiological arousal, the concurrent reduction in circadian amplitude and stability argue more for dysregulation than for improved stress physiology. Taken holistically, the magnitude and functional relevance of the sleep and behavioral changes—both of which have strong, proximal links to perceived stress—outweigh the isolated improvements in depressive symptom count and subjective happiness. On balance, the multimodal pattern is most consistent with an increase in perceived stress since the prior assessment.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
33657,-5.0,"Psychological symptom measures show a clear and substantial worsening between waves. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D rose by 18 points (from 16 to 34), producing a large positive Z-score (2.3) and a shift into a high symptom range. Trait anxiety (STAI) increased by 16 points (37 → 53), also moving from a non-anxious to an anxious classification. Self-reported self-esteem fell markedly (41 → 22, a drop of 19 points, Z-change ~ -3.5), and single-item happiness and health-satisfaction ratings declined. These large-magnitude changes in mood, anxiety-proneness, and self-worth are internally consistent and, given typical psychometric relationships, indicate increased subjective distress and reduced perceived coping resources relative to the prior wave.

Objective and physiological wearable data accentuate signals of disrupted regulation consistent with increased stress load. Resting heart rate rose by ~3.2 beats per minute and the day’s aggregated hourly heart rates show higher mean values across multiple daytime and evening hours compared with the prior recording period, consistent with higher tonic and/or situational physiological arousal. Circadian rhythm analyses indicate reduced amplitude and a modestly later acrophase (shifted ~30 minutes later), decreased interdaily stability and a pronounced increase in intradaily variability (0.67 → 0.94, Z-change ~+1.7), which reflects greater fragmentation and less regular day-to-day structure in heart-rate rhythms. Sleep on the wearable shows only a small median duration decrease (~11 minutes) but much larger deterioration in regularity: night-to-night sleep-duration standard deviation increased by ~50 minutes and sleep-start time variability more than doubled (SD increase ~75 minutes). The combination of elevated heart rate, dampened amplitude, and greater circadian and sleep irregularity aligns with physiological patterns commonly associated with elevated stress and reduced homeostatic stability.

Self-reported sleep and lifestyle behaviors provide a complementary behavioral context. Subjective weekday sleep duration decreased from 7 to 6 hours, and the participant reports less perceived control over sleep. Alcohol and internet use decreased modestly and the participant reports more socializing and initiation of occasional sports activity, which are potentially protective behaviors. However, exercise frequency overall appears lower (less frequent solo and group exercise) and perceived physical health satisfaction dropped substantially. The net behavioral picture is mixed: some adaptive changes (reduced alcohol, increased social time, some sports uptake) are present, but these do not outweigh the large adverse shifts in mood, anxiety, self-esteem, physiological arousal, and sleep regularity.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: the strongest signals (large increases in depressive and trait anxiety scores, major drop in self-esteem, higher resting and daytime heart rates, and marked increases in intradaily variability and sleep-timing variability) point toward an overall worsening in the participant’s stress-related state since the previous wave. Some behavioral changes are favorable, but they are smaller in magnitude and less consistently associated with improved stress markers. Given the magnitude and convergence of psychological symptom escalation and physiological dysregulation, the most supported overall direction is an increase in perceived stress.

36117,-3.0,"Multimodal self-report synthesis:
Compared with the prior wave, the participant shows a mixed but notable shift in self-reported affective and interpersonal measures. Trait anxiety (STAI) increased from 38 to 40 (Z-score change +0.5) moving the classification from not anxious to anxious; concurrently the CES-D score for depressive symptoms changed only slightly (16 → 15). Self-esteem declined substantially (45 → 40; Z-score of delta ≈ -0.9), and single-item indicators of social well-being also worsened: self-reported happiness fell markedly (5 → 3; large negative Z-delta) and reported interpersonal trust declined (4.17 → 3.50). These changes indicate increased anxiety proneness and reductions in perceived self-worth and positive affect/social trust since the prior assessment, despite a small improvement on the depressive symptom scale.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes:
Daily activities and social behaviors shifted toward reduced social engagement and altered leisure patterns. Time socializing with friends decreased (from >4 hours to 2–3 hours); internet use and other broadly sedentary activities also declined, while video game time increased from none to a measurable amount. Exercise with others remains frequent (three times a week or more) and substance use patterns are stable. Body mass index increased from 22.04 to 23.57. Taken together, the pattern shows reduced social contact and altered leisure behaviors accompanied by modest weight gain; these behavioral shifts align with the declines in social trust and happiness reported above.

Sleep and circadian sleep–wake pattern:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate shorter objective sleep and substantially greater night-to-night regularity. Median nightly sleep decreased by about 44 minutes (7h39m → 6h55m), while the standard deviation of sleep duration and of sleep start times dropped considerably (sleep SD from 93 to 59 minutes; start-time SD from 100 to 39 minutes). The participant’s usual weekday sleep remains short relative to their desired 8 hours, and subjective control over sleep duration remains low. This profile indicates more consistent but shorter sleep, which can be associated with increased subjective stress or reduced recovery despite improved timing regularity.

Physiological arousal and circadian rhythm features:
Cardiovascular metrics show a lowering of average cardiac activity and stronger day-to-day rhythm stability. Resting heart rate declined from 72.3 to 67.8 bpm and the mesor and amplitude of the cosinor fit decreased; hourly aggregated heart rates are generally lower across the day compared with the previous wave. Non-parametric circadian measures (interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 h) increased markedly, indicating more regular and consistent 24-hour heart-rate patterns. Intradaily variability is low and increased only slightly. The combination of lower mean cardiac levels with higher interdaily stability suggests either reduced physiological arousal (or improved cardiovascular fitness) and a more regular circadian structure; however, the reduced amplitude could also reflect blunted daytime activation. These physiological changes do not directly mirror the worsening of several subjective affective measures and likely reflect changes in activity patterns as well as autonomic tone.

Integrated interpretation with respect to perceived stress (PSS):
Evidence is mixed across modalities. Subjective affective and social measures—particularly an increase in trait anxiety, declines in self-esteem, happiness, and interpersonal trust, and reduced social time—are signals consistent with increased perceived stress. Objective sleep loss (≈44 minutes less sleep) also supports the possibility of greater stress burden or reduced recovery. In contrast, wearable physiology shows lower resting heart rate and stronger interdaily circadian stability—findings that typically reflect either improved regularity or reduced physiological arousal, which could be neutral or protective with respect to stress. Given that the PSS captures perceived stress, and because self-reported anxiety and positive-affect/social measures have moved in directions typically associated with greater perceived stress while sleep duration has decreased, the balance of evidence favors an increase in the participant’s perceived stress since the prior wave.

92515,-1.0,"Self-report measures indicate a pattern of declining psychosocial well-being relative to the prior wave. The participant’s self-reported happiness shows a notable drop (−2 points; Z-change ≈ −1.8), and interpersonal trust also fell substantially (−0.67 points; Z-change ≈ −1.75). Self-esteem decreased moderately (−3 points; Z-change ≈ −0.53). Depressive symptom frequency (CES-D) rose modestly (+2 points) but remains in the non-depressed range; trait anxiety (STAI) rose by one point and remains non-elevated. Health satisfaction declined slightly. These converging self-report changes—especially the larger declines in happiness and trust combined with the rise in depressive symptoms—are consistent with an increase in subjective distress or reduced perceived well-being since the previous assessment.

Behavioral reports and daily activities show mixed signals but lean toward reduced social and pleasurable engagement. Time spent socializing declined and the participant stopped listening to music, while time spent playing video games increased markedly. Alcohol consumption (wine/liquor) decreased and recreational/non-prescribed drug use remained absent. Exercise frequency when done alone increased (from monthly to weekly), which is a potentially protective change; however, the decrease in social activity and leisure that previously involved positive affect may contribute to elevated perceived stress or lower mood.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics indicate reduced circadian robustness and subtle changes in physiological arousal coincident with the self-report pattern. Interdaily stability decreased (current 0.33 from 0.46; Z-change ≈ −1.03), and amplitude of the heart-rate circadian rhythm declined (Z-change ≈ −0.43), indicating a less pronounced daily rhythm in heart rate across the recording period. Resting heart rate increased by ~2 bpm (from 56.8 to 58.8), a small upward shift in baseline autonomic tone. Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show pronounced midday/afternoon elevations relative to the resting heart rate, consistent with higher physiological activation during waking hours. Sleep timing shows a modest increase in median sleep duration (≈+18 minutes) and earlier median sleep start time (≈18 minutes earlier) with decreased variability in sleep start time, but overall night-to-night sleep duration variability increased (standard deviation +29 minutes). Taken together, the physiology and sleep data point to a modest reduction in circadian regularity and somewhat greater sleep variability, alongside slightly elevated resting cardiac tone—features commonly associated with increased stress or reduced resilience.

Holistic synthesis and direction of change: multiple domains support a worsening in perceived stress. Significant declines in self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust, moderate reductions in self-esteem, and small increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety together indicate increased subjective strain. Wearable findings (lower interdaily stability and circadian amplitude, small increase in resting heart rate, greater night-to-night sleep duration variability) provide convergent physiological evidence of reduced regulatory stability. Countervailing or potentially protective changes—slightly longer median sleep, earlier and more regular sleep timing, and increased solitary exercise frequency—are present but appear smaller in magnitude and less consistent than the declines in psychosocial measures and circadian robustness. On balance, the weight of evidence indicates an increase in perceived stress since the prior data collection.

48154,-4.0,"The self-report psychological profile shows generally favorable signs relative to the prior wave. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased from 30 to 26, and depressive symptom scores (CES-D) remained low and unchanged. Global self-esteem remained high and stable, and satisfaction with health increased modestly. Concurrently, social/leisure patterns shifted: time spent socializing decreased while time using the internet, watching video, and listening to music increased substantially. Recreational drug use (self-reported) increased by one frequency category (from less than monthly to monthly). Taken together, the questionnaire pattern suggests lower self-reported anxiety and stable low depressive symptoms, but greater retreat into solitary media use and a small increase in recreational substance exposure.

Sleep-related measures present a mixed picture. Objective sleep from the wearable shows a modest reduction in median sleep duration (≈21 minutes shorter) and a small earlier median sleep start time (~16 minutes earlier), with increases in night-to-night variability in both duration and start time. Self-reported typical weekday sleep decreased more markedly (from 8 to 7 hours) and the participant reported a clear loss of perceived control over sleep duration (changed from “Agree” to “Disagree”), a substantial subjective worsening. Overall, objective sleep changes are small-to-moderate, but subjective experience of poorer sleep control is a salient negative shift that can influence perceived stress.

Cardiovascular and circadian markers derived from the wearable point to improved physiological regularity and lower baseline arousal. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation increased, and cosinor amplitude rose considerably (from ~8.1 to ~13.7), indicating a stronger day–night heart rate rhythm; the acrophase shifted earlier by roughly 30–40 minutes and mesor increased slightly. Resting heart rate decreased modestly (56.0 to 54.8 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower overnight rates and larger daytime/evening peaks relative to the prior epoch. These changes—greater circadian robustness, larger amplitude of diurnal variation, and a small reduction in resting heart rate—are consistent with improved physiological regulation and reduced tonic cardiovascular stress.

Activity and lifestyle indices contain mixed signals. Physical activity increased in some respects: frequency of sports increased to three times a week or more, and exercising alone remained regular. These behavioral increases in sport are consistent with improved fitness and may underlie some of the favorable cardiovascular changes. However, social engagement decreased and passive media consumption rose substantially, and recreational drug exposure increased modestly; these changes could represent coping patterns that carry risk for perceived stress. The net behavioral pattern therefore reflects increased structured physical activity and circadian regularity on one hand, and increased solitary media use and reduced social contact on the other.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward reduced physiological arousal and lower trait anxiety (decrease in STAI, lower resting heart rate, greater circadian amplitude and stability, increased sports activity). The most notable countervailing signals are the subjective loss of control over sleep, reduced socializing, increased solitary media use, and a modest rise in recreational substance use. Given the magnitude and consistency of the physiological and anxiety-related improvements versus the moderate behavioral risks and subjective sleep concerns, the balance of evidence indicates that perceived stress has most likely decreased or remained stable-to-decreasing since the prior wave.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
67709,4.0,"Psychological symptom reports show notable worsening since the prior wave. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D) increased by 7 points to a score of 36, remaining in the depressed range and representing a large positive z-score (2.51) relative to the study sample. Trait anxiety (STAI) rose by 8 points to 54 (z = 1.46), indicating increased anxiety proneness compared with the cohort. Self-esteem declined modestly (−2 points) and overall satisfaction with physical health dropped substantially (−0.89 points). These self-report shifts are directionally consistent with increased negative affective load and reduced perceived health status; the CES-D change has a positive correlation with PSS change in the dataset (delta correlation 0.25), which reinforces that changes in mood/anxiety symptoms are relevant to perceived stress dynamics.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators generally reflect reductions in protective activities and increases in sedentary leisure. Frequency of exercise declined, most markedly for exercising with others (from three times/week to 1–2 times/month). Time spent in sedentary hobbies and watching media increased, while internet and music use decreased slightly; socializing time remained stable. Substance use is absent and stable. The drop in social/structured physical activity combined with increases in sedentary recreation and lower health satisfaction is consistent with reduced behavioral coping resources and aligns with an interpretation of increased psychosocial strain.

Sleep presents a mixed picture between subjective reports and objective wearable measures. Subjectively the participant reports a large decline in normal weekday sleep duration (from 7 to 4 hours) and a reduced ideal weekday sleep time (from 8 to 6 hours). However, Fitbit-derived median sleep duration is essentially unchanged (≈8 hr 6 min, a 10-minute decrease from the prior median), indicating a discrepancy between perceived and device-measured sleep quantity. Crucially, night-to-night variability has increased markedly: sleep duration standard deviation rose by ~80 minutes (now 254 minutes, z ≈ 3.94) and sleep start time variability increased dramatically (SD +177 minutes). These objective increases in variability indicate highly irregular sleep timing and duration across nights, even if median duration remains similar. Irregular sleep timing and large variability are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and greater stress reactivity, and the participant’s reported weekday sleep of 4 hours suggests perceived insufficient or misaligned sleep despite occasional longer sleep episodes measured by the device.

Wearable-derived autonomic and circadian metrics indicate increased daytime physiological activation and a reorganization of rhythm parameters. Resting heart rate increased by 3.4 bpm (from 52.8 to 56.2), and the cosinor-derived MESOR rose by ~7.5 units with amplitude increased as well, implying higher average and greater daily fluctuation in heart-rate levels. The acrophase shifted earlier (peak moved from ~6:50 PM to ~5:17 PM). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show broadly higher mean heart rates across daytime and evening hours relative to the previous period (notably mid-afternoon and early evening peaks near the high 80s bpm), consistent with an elevation of physiological arousal throughout the day. At the same time, interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours show modest increases while intradaily variability decreased slightly; these indicate some increase in day-to-day rhythmic regularity even as within-day heart-rate amplitude and mean levels rose. Overall, the autonomic pattern—higher resting HR and consistently higher daytime heart rates—points to increased physiological load rather than relaxation.

Integrative interpretation: multiple data streams converge toward greater psychosocial and physiological stress. Large increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, reduced exercise (particularly social exercise), lower health satisfaction, heightened and more pervasive daytime heart rates, and marked instability in sleep timing/duration collectively indicate higher strain and reduced coping resources relative to the prior wave. The discrepancy between self-reported short weekday sleep and objectively measured median sleep likely reflects fragmented or irregular sleep patterns that are experienced as insufficient. A few measures show modest improvements or stabilization (e.g., median objective sleep duration nearly unchanged, small improvement in sleep latency, slight increases in interdaily stability), but these are outweighed by the magnitude and consistency of worsening signals in affective symptoms, decreased health behaviors, increased heart-rate measures, and extreme sleep variability. Taken holistically, the evidence robustly favors an increase in perceived stress since the previous assessment.

{""stress_direction"": ""increase""}"
36552,-9.0,"Multimodal summary and context: The participant’s baseline Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score was moderately elevated (24, Z ≈ 0.65). Across the two assessment waves the pattern of change is heterogeneous: some self-report indicators of mood and perceived health worsened modestly while objective physiological and several behavioral markers moved in directions commonly associated with reduced physiological stress and improved circadian organization. The available correlations linking specific metric changes to PSS change are generally small, so interpretation must weigh magnitude and coherence of changes across domains rather than rely on any single correlation.

Self-report psychological and health-related measures: Depressive symptoms (CES-D) increased from 10 to 14, a measurable change though still in the “not depressed” range; this change is one signal consistent with increased negative affect. Trait anxiety (STAI) decreased by only one point and remains elevated relative to the sample mean; self-esteem declined by two points and health satisfaction fell by about 0.6 points. In contrast, single-item happiness increased by one point and interpersonal trust edged upward. Taken together, subjective affect and self-evaluations show mixed signals: modest worsening on depressive symptom and self-evaluation scales, but concurrent increases in happiness and social engagement suggest not purely unidirectional worsening of mood.

Behavioral habits and social activity: The participant reports substantive increases in socializing and time spent exercising with others, reduced alcohol (beer) use, and steadiness in frequent solitary exercise. Recreational sedentary behaviors (watching TV, listening to music) decreased while internet use rose slightly. These behavioral shifts—more social contact, maintained high exercise frequency, and reduced alcohol—are generally associated with resilience and lower perceived stress in young adults and represent protective or positive lifestyle changes of meaningful magnitude.

Wearable physiological and circadian indicators: Resting heart rate decreased markedly (about 5 bpm, with a large negative Z-change), and the heart rate hourly profile is broadly lower across the day in the current wave compared with the prior wave. Cosinor-derived features indicate a lower MESOR and a modest increase in amplitude with an earlier acrophase (~1h12m earlier), while interdaily stability improved slightly and intradaily variability increased. The combination of a substantially lower resting HR and an earlier, more organized activity/heart-rate peak suggests improved cardiovascular recovery and a shift toward an earlier, more consolidated circadian pattern; however, the increase in intraday variability and larger variability in sleep duration indicate some within-day fragmentation of activity/sleep timing.

Sleep timing and duration: Self-reported weekday sleep increased by about one hour (6 → 7 hours) and sleep latency shortened markedly (15 → 5 minutes), both suggesting subjectively better sleep initiation and longer habitual sleep. Objective Fitbit-derived median sleep duration changed only minimally (+6 minutes) and remains below 7 hours (median ~6 h 29 m), but median sleep start time shifted earlier by about one hour and sleep start-time variability decreased. Conversely, night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased (SD from 49 to 79 minutes). Overall, the participant shifted to an earlier sleep schedule with faster sleep initiation and modestly increased perceived sleep time, but objective duration remains somewhat short and more variable night-to-night.

Integrated interpretation and likely PSS direction: The signal is mixed but leans toward reduced physiological stress and improved recovery-related behavior. Objective physiology shows a substantial and coherent improvement (notably lower resting heart rate and earlier acrophase) that often tracks reductions in allostatic load and perceived stress. Behavioral and social changes (more socializing, stable frequent exercise, decreased alcohol use) align with reduced stress exposure or better coping. Offsetting these positives are modest increases in depressive symptom score and in intradaily variability and sleep-duration variability, which are risk indicators for increased perceived stress. Given the large magnitude and coherence of the physiological improvements (resting HR decline, more consolidated sleep timing) together with increased social contact and reported happiness, these improvements are judged to outweigh the modest adverse shifts in depressive symptoms and variability. On balance the multimodal pattern is more consistent with stable or decreased perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

63138,-9.0,"Multimodal summary — psychological self-report and behavior:
Relative to the prior wave, the participant shows several notable self-report changes that cluster toward improved psychosocial functioning. Trait anxiety (STAI-T) declined from 40 to 36 (∆ = −4), moving the participant from the prior ""anxious"" band to a lower score; self-esteem increased substantially (Rosenberg: 38 → 45, ∆ = +7), a large positive shift relative to the study population. Depressive symptom scores on the CES-D rose from 8 to 12 (∆ = +4), a modest increase that nevertheless remains below clinical thresholds in this dataset. Overall happiness was unchanged and general health satisfaction shows a small decline (4.78 → 4.56, ∆ = −0.22). Recreational patterns shifted toward more passive screen-based leisure (watching TV increased markedly; internet use increased from ~31 minutes to ~2–3 hours), while socializing time remained stable. Substance-use indicators are unchanged.

Sleep and circadian behavior:
Objective sleep recorded by the wearable increased in duration and shifted earlier. Median nightly sleep increased by ~39 minutes (8 h 21 m → 9 h 00 m) and the median sleep start time advanced earlier by ~1 hour 21 minutes (01:37 → 00:16). Self-reported weekday sleep duration increased from 6 to 7 hours and self-reported sleep latency increased slightly (25 → 30 minutes). Sleep timing variability shows a modest increase (sleep start SD 58 → 73 minutes; duration SD small change), indicating a slight loss of night-to-night consistency despite longer average sleep. The earlier sleep timing combined with longer duration is consistent with improved sleep opportunity and aligns with other indices of a shifted circadian phase.

Physiological and circadian rhythm indicators:
Cardiovascular indices derived from the Fitbit indicate lower overall physiological activation. Resting heart rate decreased by 3.45 bpm (63.65 → 60.20). The cosinor-derived MESOR (mean circadian level) declined substantially (≈80.94 → 72.81) and amplitude also decreased, while acrophase advanced (previously ~5:32 PM → current ~3:57 PM). Hourly aggregated heart rates across daytime hours are generally lower than in the prior period, consistent with a reduced daytime cardiovascular tone. Measures of rhythm regularity show small changes: interdaily stability decreased slightly (0.44 → 0.40) and intradaily variability is high but approximately stable (0.82 → 0.81). The pattern is most consistent with a phase advance and lower tonic cardiovascular arousal rather than with increased physiological stress.

Activity and lifestyle:
Physical activity frequency increased: exercise with others and sports frequency rose by one ordinal level each (e.g., from monthly to weekly), and exercising alone increased modestly. Increased activity and fitness-related behavior are concordant with the reduced resting heart rate. However, sedentary leisure (watching TV, internet use) increased substantially, which may reflect shifts in coping or available free time. Other health behaviors and BMI are essentially unchanged.

Integrative interpretation related to perceived stress:
Several convergent data streams point toward a reduction or stabilization of perceived stress. Decreases in trait anxiety, a marked rise in self-esteem, longer and earlier sleep, lower resting heart rate and lower daytime heart rate levels, and increased exercise frequency together suggest reduced physiological and psychological stress load or improved coping/resource levels since the prior wave. Contrasting signals include a modest increase in depressive symptom score (CES-D +4), a small decline in health satisfaction, and a large increase in passive screen-based leisure; these could reflect transient mood or behavioral shifts that can co-occur with decreased physiological arousal and improved self-concept. Correlational weights provided in the dataset for individual deltas are small and do not strongly override the multimodal pattern. On balance, the preponderance of evidence — especially physiological downshifts in cardiac activity, improved sleep duration/timing, reduced trait anxiety, and increased self-esteem and exercise — favors an overall decrease or stability (improvement) in perceived stress relative to the prior data collection.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
29134,-3.0,"The participant’s affective and trait-level self-report measures show directional improvement since the prior wave. Depressive symptom scores on the CES-D fell substantially (12.0 → 5.0), and trait anxiety on the STAI decreased (38 → 31); both changes are large relative to population variation (Z‑score deltas ≈ -0.6). Self-esteem is stable at a high level (39 unchanged), and global health satisfaction increased slightly. These coordinated reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom scores provide direct evidence consistent with reduced psychological distress and lower chronic affective burden compared with the earlier assessment.

Objective cardiac and circadian physiology provide additional evidence compatible with reduced physiological arousal. Resting heart rate declined from 61.0 bpm to 58.6 bpm, a measurable reduction in baseline cardiovascular tone. The cosinor-derived amplitude increased (8.38 → 10.07) and mesor was essentially unchanged, while acrophase shifted earlier (≈6:01 PM → 5:03 PM). Although interdaily stability decreased modestly and intradaily variability increased, the lower resting heart rate and greater amplitude are most consistent with an increase in the day–night contrast of cardiac activity and, on balance, a small move toward lower tonic arousal across the recording period.

Sleep metrics show a mixed but largely favorable pattern on objective wearable data and greater variability in duration. Median nightly sleep recorded by the wearable increased slightly (7 h 40 m → 7 h 56 m) and median sleep start time moved earlier by about 49 minutes, with reduced variability in sleep start times (SD of start time decreased). However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased substantially (SD 159 → 210 minutes), indicating inconsistent amounts of sleep across nights. Subjective weekday sleep reports diverge: the participant reports a shorter typical weekday duration (7 → 6 hours) and unchanged long sleep latency (45 minutes). Taken together, objective sleep timing and median duration suggest modest improvement in opportunity and timing for restorative sleep, but the marked increase in duration variability and the subjective report of shorter weekday sleep imply ongoing irregularity that could blunt recuperative effects.

Daily behavioral and social patterns show selective reductions in social and leisure engagement alongside stable or increased solitary and potentially risk-related activities. Time spent socializing and reading declined, internet use decreased, and reported happiness dropped (4 → 3). Exercise frequency remained high and stable, particularly for group exercise and sports. Notably, recreational and non-prescribed drug use increased from ""not at all"" to ""less than 1–2 times a month"" — a small but upward change in substance-related behavior. Declines in social contact and self-reported happiness could reflect increased isolation or lower momentary positive affect that are not fully captured by the reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms; these behavioral shifts warrant attention as potential sources of stress vulnerability even if they do not yet produce higher mood symptom scores.

Rhythm regularity measures are mixed in their implications for stress. Interdaily stability decreased (0.42 → 0.36) and intradaily variability increased (0.57 → 0.65), indicating a modest loss of regularity and more fragmentation of circadian patterns from day to day and within days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased slightly and amplitude increased, suggesting stronger within-day amplitude but less day-to-day consistency. This pattern can coexist with lower tonic arousal (lower resting HR) but also signals instability that can be a stress-related vulnerability, particularly when combined with greater night-to-night sleep duration variability.

Holistic synthesis: the strongest, most directly stress-relevant signals—the large declines in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety and the reduction in resting heart rate—point toward an overall reduction in perceived stress compared with the prior wave. Objective improvements in median sleep duration and earlier, more consistent bedtimes reinforce that direction, although increased variability in sleep duration, reduced socializing and happiness scores, and slight increases in intradaily fragmentation and occasional substance use introduce countervailing concerns. Weighing the magnitude and clinical relevance of changes, the net evidence supports an overall improvement (or stability with improvement in key distress markers) in perceived stress rather than a deterioration.

{""stress_direction"": ""stable_decrease""}"
24029,-13.0,"Psychological symptom measures and self-evaluations show large, consistent shifts toward lower internalizing symptom burden and higher self-regard. The CES-D score fell dramatically (21 → 3), and trait anxiety on the STAI declined substantially (50 → 33); both changes are large in magnitude and indicate markedly reduced depressive and anxiety symptom reporting. Self-esteem increased considerably relative to the prior wave (previously low, now much higher), and self-rated health satisfaction rose. Self-reported happiness declined slightly, but this small drop contrasts with larger and more clinically meaningful improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these survey-level changes constitute strong evidence of improved affective functioning and psychological well-being compared with the prior assessment.

Sleep behavior as measured by the wearable and by self-report changed in both quantity and timing. Median nightly sleep duration increased by roughly 37 minutes and night-to-night variability of sleep duration decreased substantially, indicating more consistent total sleep. However, the median sleep start time shifted later by just over three hours (from ~22:44 to ~01:57), and sleep-start timing variability decreased, reflecting a later but more consistent sleep schedule. The participant also reports continued sense of control over sleep duration and minimal changes in self-reported sleep latency and desired sleep. Overall, sleep quantity and consistency appear improved, though timing has moved later, which could reflect schedule or lifestyle changes rather than worse sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics indicate increased daily rhythmic structure and lower within-day fragmentation. Intradaily variability declined markedly (0.87 → 0.57), suggesting fewer short-term transitions in heart-rate–derived activity across the day, while interdaily stability increased modestly, indicating more consistent day-to-day rhythm. Amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm increased slightly and MESOR changed little; resting heart rate remained low and stable. Aggregated hourly heart-rate values show time-of-day differences relative to the prior wave (e.g., higher evening peaks in the current aggregation), but resting heart rate and overall rhythm-related metrics point to greater regularity and modestly stronger circadian amplitude, consistent with improved physiological regulation rather than increased chronic arousal.

Behavioral activities changed in ways that are partly divergent. Physical activity and organized sports declined (fewer exercise sessions and sports reduced to none), which is a potential negative for stress resilience. Time spent on video games increased substantially, and time listening to music decreased; at the same time, time socializing and time spent reading increased. Substance use remains negligible. Thus, social and cognitive leisure activities increased, while formal exercise decreased and sedentary gaming increased. These behavioral shifts may have mixed effects on stress: reduced exercise is a risk factor for higher stress, but increases in socializing, reading, and more sleep quantity/regularity likely contribute to improved mood and lower perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation with respect to perceived stress: baseline PSS was high (30, Z = 2.28), and the pattern of multimodal data provides stronger evidence for a reduction in stress than for worsening. Large reductions in depressive and anxiety symptom scores and substantial gains in self-esteem and health satisfaction are central indicators that align with decreasing perceived stress. Physiological circadian measures and sleep consistency also improved, supporting reduced physiological dysregulation. The main countervailing signals are decreased exercise and a later sleep schedule; these are important but appear secondary to the large psychosocial improvements. Additionally, the provided correlation of initial PSS with change is negative (−0.56), suggesting those with high initial PSS tended to decrease over time in this sample, consistent with the observed pattern. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors an overall decrease or stabilization (improvement) in perceived stress rather than an increase.

49086,-5.0,"Physiological and circadian profile: Wearable-derived cardiovascular metrics show a pronounced downward shift in basal heart rate and mean circadian level. Resting heart rate declined markedly (56.8 → 46.1 bpm) and the cosinor-derived MESOR decreased (~70.4 → 62.3), indicating a lower average heart rate across the day relative to the prior wave. At the same time amplitude increased (8.7 → 13.1), and the acrophase shifted later (around 5:00 PM → 6:27 PM), signifying a larger day–night range in heart rate and a phase delay in the peak. Hourly aggregated heart rates are lower across many hours compared with the prior period, particularly at night and in the morning. These physiological changes are consistent with reduced tonic cardiovascular arousal and/or improved cardiovascular fitness; the large drop in resting HR aligns with the reported increase in regular physical activity rather than with increased physiological stress. Non-parametric circadian features show modestly greater interdaily stability and slightly increased intradaily variability; the former suggests more consistent day-to-day patterning of activity/HR, while the latter indicates somewhat more fragmentation within days.

Sleep patterning and subjective sleep: Both objective and subjective sleep indicators moved in a direction that suggests greater regularity and modestly longer sleep. Median sleep duration increased by about 18 minutes, night-to-night variability declined (sleep duration SD: 107 → 81 minutes), sleep latency shortened (15 → 10 minutes), and sleep start time variability decreased. Self-reported usual weekday sleep duration remained stable at about 7 hours and the participant continued to report agreement with being in control of sleep duration. Together these changes point to more consistent and slightly more restorative sleep opportunity and perception—factors typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Behavioral and psychosocial indicators: The participant reported increased engagement in exercise and sports (notably initiating regular sports activity and some solitary exercise), stable body mass index, and substantially higher health satisfaction. Self-reported happiness increased (3 → 4) and self-esteem remained high and unchanged. Recreational habits show reduced TV and other sedentary hobbies, increased internet use, and a small decline in time spent socializing with friends. Substance use patterns remained stable. Trust decreased slightly. Of the affective symptom measures, depressive symptom score (CES-D) increased from a very low baseline (1 → 7) and trait anxiety rose minimally (31 → 33), but both remain in ranges not classified as clinical; the CES-D increase is the clearest change in symptom report and carries a modest positive correlation with PSS change in the data provided.

Integrative interpretation and implications for perceived stress: Physiological, sleep, and behavioral signals converge on an overall pattern of improved health behaviors and lower basal physiological arousal: increased physical activity, markedly lower resting heart rate and MESOR, greater circadian amplitude, improved sleep regularity and reduced latency, and higher health satisfaction and happiness. These changes are commonly associated with reductions in perceived stress. Countervailing signals are limited: a moderate increase in depressive symptom score (though still low in absolute terms) and a small increase in trait anxiety could push perceived stress upward, and modest reductions in socializing and trust may also be relevant. Taken holistically, the stronger and larger-magnitude objective changes (notably the large drop in resting heart rate, improved sleep stability, and increased exercise) alongside subjective gains in happiness and health satisfaction outweigh the modest increases in symptom scores. Therefore the balance of multimodal evidence indicates that perceived stress is more likely to have remained stable or decreased compared with the prior wave.

95490,-1.0,"Multimodal psychological profile and self-report change:
The participant’s self-report psychological measures show several notable improvements between waves. Trait anxiety on the STAI declined substantially (47 → 38; Z-score change ≈ -0.91), shifting from the prior “anxious” classification to “not anxious.” Depressive symptoms on the CES-D decreased modestly (14 → 12; Score Delta -2), and self-esteem increased (34 → 38; Score Delta +4, Z-Score of Delta +0.76). Global happiness remained unchanged at the scale midpoint, while trust increased slightly. These changes in trait affect and self-worth represent consistent subjective reductions in anxiety- and depression-related symptom burden and improved self-evaluative resources that are closely related to perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes relevant to stress regulation:
Several lifestyle behaviors shifted in ways that could influence perceived stress in opposing directions. The participant reports decreased frequency of exercising alone (previously ≥3×/week to now 1–2×/week) and reduced time socializing with friends (down by one unit on the scale). Internet use and brief video game engagement increased modestly. Alcohol use remained stable; recreational drug use increased from “not at all” to “less than 1–2 times a month” (small numeric change). Health satisfaction declined slightly. Reduced exercise and diminished social time are changes that can reduce behavioral coping resources, while increased sedentary/online leisure and a small rise in recreational drug use may reflect compensatory coping. Overall, behavioral shifts present a mixed picture: some loss of active social and exercise coping but modest upticks in passive/solitary leisure.

Objective sleep and subjective sleep discrepancy:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics and self-reported sleep diverge. Fitbit-recorded median nightly sleep duration increased markedly (from ~6 h 56 m to ~9 h 5 m; Delta ≈ +2 h 8 m; Z-Score of Delta +2.38), and night-to-night variability increased slightly. Sleep start time moved modestly earlier and became less variable. By contrast, the participant’s self-reported “normal weekday sleep duration” decreased (6 → 5 hours) and their perceived control over sleep diminished (from “Agree” to “Somewhat Agree”). Sleep latency was unchanged. The objective increase in recorded sleep duration is large and would commonly be associated with reduced sleep-related stress and improved recovery; however, the participant’s subjective report of shorter weekday sleep and less sleep control suggests either different perceptions of sleep quality/timing on weekdays versus overall sampled days or a mismatch between in-lab/wearable-recorded nights and the participant’s weekday experience. This discrepancy moderates how confidently sleep changes can be taken as evidence for reduced perceived stress.

Cardiovascular and circadian physiology:
Wearable heart-rate and circadian metrics show mixed but concerning changes in autonomic signatures. Resting heart rate increased substantially (61.4 → 68.8 bpm; Delta +7.4; Z-Score of Delta +1.61), and the MESOR (overall mean level of the circadian HR rhythm) increased (76.38 → 80.79; Z-Score change +1.19). Circadian amplitude decreased markedly (9.01 → 4.55; Z-Score ≈ -2.3), indicating a pronounced flattening of the diurnal heart rate rhythm. Aggregated hourly heart rates are elevated across many hours (including nighttime), relative to the previous wave, consistent with higher basal physiological activation and reduced day–night contrast. Non-parametric rhythm markers show small improvements in intradaily variability (0.58 → 0.46) and a negligible change in interdaily stability. Elevated resting HR and a flattened amplitude—especially when nighttime rates are higher—are physiological patterns commonly associated with greater autonomic arousal and reduced recovery, which can reflect increased physiological stress or deconditioning despite some improvements in subjective mood metrics.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress (PSS):
Taken together, the evidence is mixed but leans toward a net reduction in perceived psychological stress. Strong indicators of reduced perceived stress include large declines in trait anxiety (STAI) and modest improvement in depressive symptoms plus higher self-esteem—subjective constructs that overlap substantially with perceived stress. Objective sleep duration increased considerably according to wearable data, which typically supports lower stress, although the participant’s own weekday sleep report and perceived sleep control worsened, creating ambiguity. Counterbalancing those subjective and mood improvements are physiological indicators of increased basal cardiovascular activation (higher resting HR and MESOR) and a flattened circadian amplitude, as well as behavioral reductions in exercise and social time—factors that may reflect ongoing physiological stress or reduced resilience. Because the PSS measures perceived stress, the pronounced and consistent reductions in trait anxiety and increases in self-esteem are particularly relevant and persuasive evidence for a decrease in perceived stress, even though physiological markers suggest elevated autonomic arousal that may warrant monitoring.

Conclusion — overall direction of perceived stress change:
Weighing the multimodal evidence—substantial decreases in trait anxiety and improved self-esteem and depressive symptoms, alongside increased objective sleep duration—against concurrent signs of higher resting heart rate, flattened circadian amplitude, reduced exercise and social time, and subjective weekday sleep concerns, the balance favors a net improvement (stable or decreased) in perceived stress as measured by PSS.

22842,-1.0,"Multimodal summary: Across the two assessment waves the participant shows a coherent pattern of worsening affective and sleep-related indicators alongside shifts in circadian structure and daily behavior. Self-report measures indicate modest increases in depressive symptomatology (CES-D +2 points) and a notable decline in self-esteem (-4 points) and health satisfaction (-0.78 on a 1–7 scale). Objective sleep from the wearable declined substantially: median nightly sleep dropped from 7 h 51 min to 6 h 40 min (≈71 minutes less) while night-to-night variability increased (sleep duration SD rose by 44 minutes, now high relative to the cohort). Circadian regularity measures and rhythm amplitude show reductions in central tendency and robustness (MESOR down ≈6 bpm, amplitude down ≈1.8 bpm), intraday variability increased slightly, and 24-hour autocorrelation decreased. Taken together, these multimodal changes are consistent with increased behavioral and physiological instability and greater depressive symptom burden over the interval.

Sleep and daily timing: The most salient objective change is reduced and more variable sleep. Median sleep decreased by roughly an hour and variability increased markedly (sleep SD now substantially above the cohort mean). Sleep onset timing shifted later by about 12 minutes and timing variability decreased modestly, but the loss of total sleep and larger night-to-night fluctuations are likely to degrade subjective rest and recovery. Self-reported sleep latency remains elevated (45 minutes) and the participant’s desired weekday sleep increased from 7 to 9 hours, indicating a growing subjective sleep need that is not being met. These convergent objective and subjective sleep signals are commonly associated with increased perceived stress and worse mood.

Affective and trait measures: Depressive symptoms showed a small but measurable increase (CES-D from 20 to 22), while trait anxiety (STAI) was effectively stable (45 versus 46). Self-esteem declined from 36 to 32, a substantial within-person drop on a 10–40 scale. Health satisfaction decreased meaningfully as well. Behavioral markers that relate to social support and recreation—time socializing declined, screen-based recreational time changed (video game and TV time down, internet use up)—suggest reduced social engagement and altered leisure patterns. The pattern of rising depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem, reduced social time, and lower health satisfaction provides converging evidence of increased psychosocial strain since the prior wave.

Physiology and circadian patterning: Resting heart rate decreased from 54.2 to 51.6 bpm, and aggregated hourly heart rates are generally lower across most hours compared with the previous wave, particularly during prior daytime/evening peaks. Lower resting HR may reflect improved cardiovascular fitness or lower overall sympathetic tone; however, it occurs in the context of reduced MESOR and amplitude and a decrease in 24-hour autocorrelation, indicating a dampening and destabilization of the circadian heart rate rhythm. Intradaily variability increased, suggesting more fragmented or less-regular activity/physiological patterns within days. These circadian changes plus increased sleep variability point toward reduced temporal organization of behavior and physiology, which often accompanies ramps in perceived stress or depressive symptoms.

Behavioral context and potential contributors: Exercise frequency reported remained high (exercising alone three times per week or more), so reduced fitness is unlikely to explain lower heart rate. Alcohol (beer) frequency increased slightly, socializing decreased, and internet use rose; these lifestyle shifts may contribute to poorer sleep and mood. Many change correlations with PSS are small, so no single metric dominates; instead the pattern across sleep loss, increased depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and health satisfaction, reduced socializing, and less robust circadian rhythmicity collectively point toward increased stress-related burden.

Direction of change in perceived stress (holistic judgment): Weighing the objective deterioration in sleep quantity and regularity, the increase in depressive symptom burden, the notable drop in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and the circadian destabilization, the preponderance of evidence indicates an overall worsening of the participant’s perceived stress relative to the prior wave.

14279,3.0,"Self-report measures indicate a substantial worsening in affective symptomatology between waves. The CES-D score rose markedly from 5 to 24, shifting the participant from a non-depressed to a “Depressed” classification and representing one of the largest changes in the dataset (Δ = +19, Z-Score of Δ = 2.24). Trait anxiety (STAI) also increased substantially (38 → 47, Δ = +9, Z-Score of Δ = 1.4), moving from a lower to a higher anxiety classification. Self-esteem declined slightly (40 → 38), while self-reported happiness remained stable at a relatively low value. These large increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are strongly relevant to perceived stress: both CES-D and STAI deltas show positive correlations with PSS change in the provided metrics, suggesting these affective shifts are likely to co-occur with an increase in perceived stress.

Objective sleep metrics from the wearable and self-reported sleep show notable, mostly protracted changes in sleep quantity and regularity. Median Fitbit sleep duration increased from about 8 h 11 m to 9 h 0 m (Δ ≈ +49 minutes, Z-Score 0.81), and night-to-night variability in both duration and sleep-start time decreased (duration SD 93 → 49 minutes; start-time SD 66 → 42 minutes). The participant’s reported weekday sleep also increased from 7 to 9 hours. These changes reflect longer and more regular sleep. Such increases in duration accompanied by reduced variability can be protective against stress for some individuals, but in the context of the concurrent sharp increase in depressive symptoms, the pattern could also represent hypersomnia or behavioral withdrawal associated with mood disturbance rather than improved restorative sleep.

Cardiovascular and circadian features present a mixed but concerning profile. Resting heart rate increased modestly (59.2 → 61.2 bpm, Δ = +2 bpm), and hourly aggregated heart-rate values indicate lower extreme daytime peaks in the current wave but a general reduction in circadian amplitude (Amplitude 12.98 → 10.94, Δ = −2.04) and a small decrease in MESOR (77.75 → 74.44). Non-parametric circadian indices show a small decrease in interdaily stability (0.48 → 0.44) and a slight increase in intradaily variability (0.70 → 0.72). Autocorrelation at 24 h increased (0.32 → 0.41). Overall, these changes suggest modestly increased physiological arousal (higher resting HR) and a dampening/flattening of daily heart-rate rhythms (lower amplitude and slightly higher fragmentation), which can be associated with greater stress load or disrupted circadian regulation.

Behavioral and social-habit changes are relevant contextual contributors. The participant reports a marked reduction in exercising with others (from ~1–2 times/week to none) and a decrease in time spent socializing; solitary exercise frequency remained low. Internet and video-game use decreased, while brief media uses (listening to music) increased slightly. Alcohol consumption shows a small increase in beer usage. Health satisfaction improved (3.78 → 4.67), which is a divergent positive signal. However, the reductions in social exercise and social time reduce potential protective social supports and may exacerbate perceived stress or mood symptoms despite improved perceived physical health.

Synthesis and inference regarding perceived stress direction: the strongest and most salient signals point toward worsening psychological strain. The pronounced increases in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are the most robust indicators and are likely to drive an increase in perceived stress. Physiological markers (increased resting HR, reduced circadian amplitude, slight increases in intraday fragmentation) align with heightened physiological stress burden. Protective signals—longer and more regular sleep and higher self-rated health satisfaction—are present but should be interpreted cautiously given the simultaneous large affective changes; extended sleep in this context may reflect mood-related hypersomnia rather than improved resilience. Taken holistically, affective and physiological evidence outweigh the limited protective signals, supporting an overall increase in perceived stress since the prior wave.

52302,-9.0,"Multimodal summary and context:
The participant’s initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is 21 (sample Z ≈ -0.17), which serves as the baseline anchor for interpreting change. Across the two data collection waves there are concurrent signals in self-report and wearable-derived measures that point in different directions. Several relatively large and clinically meaningful within-subject changes are present (notably a substantial drop in trait anxiety and marked improvements in circadian regularity), while other behavioral and affective indicators show modest deterioration (increased alcohol use, lower reported happiness and health satisfaction, and a small increase in BMI). Because these changes are heterogeneous, the synthesis below emphasizes the largest and most consistent shifts and then integrates conflicting indicators to assess likely direction of change in perceived stress.

Self-report psychological measures:
Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased substantially from 43 to 33 (Z-change ≈ -1.04), shifting the participant from the “anxious” to “not anxious” classification; this is the largest single psychological change and would typically be associated with reduced ongoing worry and stress proneness. Self-esteem increased (score +4; Z-change ≈ +0.76), which is concordant with reduced self-reported vulnerability to stress. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) rose modestly (7 → 10) but remain in a low, non‑clinical range; this small increase is unlikely, by itself, to indicate a major worsening in perceived stress. Subjective happiness and health satisfaction declined (happiness −1; health satisfaction −0.78), which provides counter-evidence to the anxiety and self-esteem improvements and suggests some decline in momentary well‑being or satisfaction despite lower trait anxiety.

Sleep timing, regularity and circadian physiology (wearable and self-report):
Wearable-derived and self-reported sleep/circadian measures show a coherent pattern of greater temporal regularity but a modest reduction in quantity and a later sleep onset. Median sleep start time shifted later by ~48 minutes and median sleep duration decreased by ~23 minutes, but night-to-night variability fell markedly: sleep duration SD decreased from 123 to 68 minutes and sleep start SD decreased from 103 to 54 minutes. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate exhibit stronger day-to-day structure (interdaily stability +0.28, large Z-change; autocorrelation at 24h +0.17) and lower intradaily fragmentation; amplitude of the fitted rhythm increased while mesor changed minimally. Resting heart rate remained low and stable. Taken together, these signals indicate the participant’s daily physiological rhythms and sleep timing became more regular and consolidated, even as total nightly sleep shortened slightly and bedtime shifted later.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle:
There are several notable behavior changes. Alcohol consumption increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a week” for both beer and wine (large Z-change), and the participant discontinued participation in organized sports (frequency dropped from weekly to not at all). Frequency of exercising alone or with others remained unchanged at a low level (1–2 times/week). Time spent on leisure activities changed unevenly: listening to music and video gaming increased, socializing with friends remained high, and reading increased slightly. BMI rose modestly (Δ ≈ +0.66). These behavioral shifts—especially increased alcohol use and reduced sports engagement—are plausibly linked to either coping-related responses to stressors or lifestyle changes that may influence perceived well‑being.

Integrated interpretation about perceived stress direction:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest individual indicators associated with reduced stress are the large decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) and the clear improvements in circadian regularity and sleep consistency. Improvements in self‑esteem and stable/low resting heart rate are additional supportive signals. Countervailing evidence that would suggest increased stress includes the rise in alcohol consumption, lower reported happiness and health satisfaction, a small reduction in sleep duration and later bedtimes, cessation of sports, and small increases in evening heart rate peaks and BMI. Overall, however, the magnitude and psychological specificity of the reduction in trait anxiety—combined with marked gains in objective circadian stability and sleep regularity—outweigh the moderate, behavioral signs of strain. Therefore, the balance of evidence supports a net improvement or stabilization (decrease) in perceived stress relative to the prior wave, while noting residual concerns (alcohol, lower momentary happiness/health satisfaction) that could merit follow-up.

77789,2.0,"Multimodal psychological profile and symptom change:
Self-report measures show a clear reduction in depressive symptom burden since the prior wave: CES-D fell from 20 to 13, moving the participant from the ""depressed"" to ""not depressed"" classification and producing a moderately large negative score delta. Self-esteem increased (36 → 39), and satisfaction with health increased substantially. Trait anxiety (STAI) is unchanged at a moderately elevated level (43), and a single-item happiness rating declined (4 → 3). Taken together, these data indicate improvement on measures associated with depressive affect and self-regard while trait-level anxiety remains stable and momentary subjective happiness is lower. The pattern suggests a net improvement in depressive symptoms and self-evaluative constructs, with mixed signals for momentary positive affect and anxiety proneness.

Behavioral habit changes:
Leisure and substance-use behaviors shifted toward more frequent alcohol consumption (beer and wine both increased to ~1–2 times/week from lower baseline frequencies). Exercise frequency increased for solo exercise (from monthly to 1–2 times/week), while social/organized physical activity remained absent. Internet use increased, and time spent reading decreased. These changes represent a mix of health-promoting (more regular solitary exercise) and potentially risk-elevating behaviors (increased alcohol use and more internet time). The magnitudes of these behavioral deltas are notable for alcohol use and exercise frequency, and they could reflect shifts in coping or social/leisure patterns that accompany changes in mood or stress.

Sleep and circadian/physiological indicators:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show generally favorable change. Median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (~25 minutes) and sleep duration variability decreased markedly (SD halved from ~166 to ~83 minutes), indicating more consistent sleep quantity. Median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 1 hour, and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration. Circadian regularity metrics from heart-rate data improved: interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation increased, intradaily variability remained essentially stable, and amplitude increased while mesor (average fitted heart rate) decreased modestly. The most salient physiological change is a substantial reduction in resting heart rate (70.4 → 62.6 bpm), accompanied by lower aggregated hourly heart rates across most daytime and nighttime hours compared with the prior wave. Collectively these changes indicate increased circadian regularity and lower average cardiovascular arousal across the day.

Integration and implications for perceived stress:
Convergent evidence across modalities points toward reduced overall physiological and affective strain. The large improvement in depressive symptoms, increased self-esteem and health satisfaction, more regular sleep (greater consistency and earlier timing), and a pronounced decrease in resting and hourly heart rates all align with a reduction in stress-related burden or physiological arousal. Offsetting signals include unchanged trait anxiety, a drop in self-reported happiness, and increased frequency of alcohol consumption, which could reflect alternative coping strategies or transient affective states. However, the magnitude and consistency of objective physiological improvements (notably resting heart rate and reduced sleep variability) together with the marked decrease in CES-D are stronger indicators of decreased perceived stress than the mixed behavioral signals indicating potential risk. On balance, the multimodal pattern supports an overall decrease or stabilization at a lower level of perceived stress compared with the prior data collection.

88882,-1.0,"The self-report measures show a mixed but predominantly negative shift in subjective well-being. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) both increased modestly from prior measurement (CES-D +2 points, STAI +3 points) while remaining below clinical thresholds. Self-esteem declined slightly and ratings of overall happiness and health satisfaction show more substantial declines (happiness: 5 → 3, health satisfaction: 5.0 → 3.56). Trust changed minimally. These changes indicate that the participant’s subjective affective state and appraisal of health have worsened more noticeably than small shifts in trait symptom scales would suggest; the large drop in self-reported happiness and the sizeable decrease in health satisfaction are particularly salient for perceived stress because they reflect current appraisal and affective tone.

Behavioral reports and lifestyle indices are largely stable with small shifts that could influence stress either way. Exercise frequency remained high and unchanged (frequent individual exercise), BMI declined modestly (–0.74), and use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs remained nil. Alcohol use shows a small uptick in wine/liquor frequency. Daily recreation shifted slightly toward more passive screen time (watching videos increased and video game time appeared where previously none was reported). Subjective weekday sleep remains low in the surveys (self-reported 5 hours, unchanged) and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration (moved from “somewhat disagree” to “somewhat agree”), a potentially adaptive cognitive change in sleep management despite desired sleep hours decreasing.

Objective wearable-derived measures show improvements in physiological regularity and sleep quantity but also some increased variability in timing. Median nightly sleep recorded by the device increased by ~34 minutes (5:57 → 6:31), and resting heart rate decreased modestly (47.6 → 46.0 bpm), both consistent with improved physiological recovery or fitness. Circadian measures indicate greater 24-hour rhythmic consistency (interdaily stability +0.07, autocorrelation at 24h +0.15) and reduced fragmentation (intradaily variability decreased by 0.12), which generally reflect more stable day-to-day activity and autonomic patterning. However, sleep timing shifted later by ~20 minutes and night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start time increased (sleep duration SD +21 minutes, start time SD +13 minutes), indicating that while average sleep increased, its timing became less consistent.

When integrating subjective and objective domains, a divergence emerges: objective physiological metrics (increased recorded sleep duration, lower resting heart rate, more coherent heart-rate circadian structure) point toward improved biological markers often associated with lower stress, while subjective affective reports (notably large declines in happiness and health satisfaction, plus small increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms) point toward greater perceived strain. Because the Perceived Stress Scale captures subjective appraisal of stress and the participant’s self-reported mood and health satisfaction have declined substantially, the subjective signal supporting increased perceived stress is stronger for PSS than the relatively small-to-moderate objective improvements. Several relevant delta correlations are small and mixed, so they do not strongly shift this interpretation; the marked drop in happiness and health satisfaction is the most influential indicator for perceived stress change.

Overall assessment: although physiological and sleep quantity indicators show modest improvement and greater circadian regularity, the pronounced decline in subjective happiness and health satisfaction together with modest increases in depressive and anxiety symptom scores suggest the participant’s perceived stress has worsened relative to the prior wave.

63347,-4.0,"Multimodal summary of major changes: Across the two assessment waves the participant shows substantial, concordant improvements in sleep quantity and regularity, increases in social exercise, and a large reduction in trait anxiety scores. Objectively recorded sleep increased by roughly 1 hour 48 minutes (median sleep duration moved from ~6 h 49 m to ~8 h 37 m; Z-score of the change ≈ 1.98), sleep start times shifted earlier by about 52 minutes, and night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration decreased (sleep start SD down ~28 minutes; sleep duration SD down ~54 minutes). Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate also improved: interdaily stability rose from 0.51 to 0.71 (Z ≈ 2.26) and 24-hour autocorrelation increased markedly (Δ ≈ 0.26, Z ≈ 1.67), consistent with a more stable daily rest-activity pattern. Concurrently, self-reported normal weekday sleep went from 6 to 8 hours and the participant shifted from disagreeing to agreeing about feeling in control of sleep duration—subjective and objective indicators of sleep align in the direction of improvement.

Physiological and circadian interpretation: The cosinor-derived mesor decreased slightly (73.09 from 77.04) while amplitude remained high, and acrophase moved only modestly later (5:14 PM to 5:32 PM). The pattern of aggregated hourly heart rates shows lower overnight and many daytime values relative to the prior wave, and evening peaks are reduced compared with the earlier profile. Resting heart rate increased by 5.5 bpm (52.3 to 57.8; Z-score of the change ≈ 1.21), which can reflect a range of influences (hydration, recent activity, measurement context, or autonomic state) and should be interpreted alongside the broader behavioral picture. Overall, heart-rate-based circadian metrics indicate increased rhythm stability and reduced intraday fragmentation, which are generally associated with better sleep and regulatory functioning despite the modest rise in resting heart rate.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes: The participant reports a large increase in organized and social exercise (exercising with others moved from none to three times per week or more; Z-score of change ≈ 3.14), and objective indices such as reduced BMI (−3.59) are consistent with increased activity and possible improvements in health behaviors. Alcohol consumption increased from rare to 1–2 times per week for both beer and wine/liquor (delta Z ≈ +1.7), while non-prescribed/recreational drug use remained nil. Daily recreation patterns show small changes (a little more internet use and modest increases in TV and reading), but socializing time remained low in absolute minutes. Health satisfaction remained essentially stable. The increase in exercise frequency and the pronounced weight reduction are behaviorally salient and typically relate to better mood and stress regulation, though the rise in alcohol use is a potential countervailing factor.

Self-report affective measures and their implications: Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined substantially from 45 to 35 (Δ = −10; Z-change ≈ −1.04), shifting classification from “anxious” to “not anxious.” Depressive symptoms on the CES-D changed minimally (14 to 13). Self-esteem fell slightly (40 to 39) and single-item happiness decreased (4 to 3), indicating some mixed changes in subjective well-being despite the large anxiety reduction. Trust rose slightly. Correlations provided with PSS change for individual deltas are modest and heterogeneous; the strongest directional signal among self-report measures is the large drop in trait anxiety, which commonly co-occurs with lower perceived stress.

Holistic assessment regarding perceived stress direction: The overall pattern is dominated by multiple large, convergent changes typically associated with reduced stress: notably, a major improvement in sleep duration and regularity, a marked increase in circadian stability, a large decrease in trait anxiety, increased social exercise and meaningful weight loss. Countervailing signals include a moderate increase in alcohol frequency, a modest increase in resting heart rate, and small declines in single-item happiness and self-esteem. Given the magnitude and coherence of the sleep, circadian, exercise, and anxiety changes—factors closely linked to perceived stress—the preponderance of evidence supports a net reduction or stability-to-improvement in perceived stress since the previous wave. The initial PSS score (21) has a negative correlation with later change (−0.56), which is consistent with regression toward lower scores among those starting higher; this statistical anchor does not outweigh the multimodal improvements observed. On balance, the data indicate that perceived stress has most likely decreased or remained stable rather than worsened.
